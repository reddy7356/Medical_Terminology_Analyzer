Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms ___, 

It was a pleasure looking after you here at ___. 

WHY WAS I IN THE HOSPITAL? 
- You present to ___ clinic and was found to have abnormal blood 
work results (high bilirubin, high white blood cells, high 
alkaline phosphatase, low red blood cells) 
- You also had noticed that you had been fatigued and itching 
since ___ 
- You had also noticed that you had blood in your stool for the 
last few months

WHAT HAPPENED TO ME IN THE HOSPITAL? 
- You got a MRI of your gallbladder, liver, pancreas and their 
ducts called an MRCP 
- You got a video test called an ERCP where videos were taken 
from inside. This helped us to see your gallbladder, liver, 
pancreas and their ducts better. This test showed that you had 
an infection of your gallbladder. A plastic stent was placed to 
help to drain this infection. These pictures also showed a mass 
that was concerning for a gallbladder cancer. Some biopsies of 
this mass were taken. 
- You got a flexible sigmoidoscopy to look at your pouch. It 
showed did show your pouch had some inflammation and there was 
an out pouching that was bleeding. This bleeding could help 
explain your low red blood cell count. Biopsies were also taken 
during this test. 
- You were started on antibiotics to treat your gallbladder 
infection

WHAT SHOULD I DO AFTER I LEAVE THE HOSPITAL? 
- Follow up with your gastroenterologist

History of Present Illness:
Ms. ___ is a lovely former ___ with a history
of UC s/p colectomy c/b chronic pouchitis, PSC and resultant
cirrhosis, sarcoidosis on hydroxychloroquine, with multiple
recent admissions for acute on chronic cholangitis c/b liver
microabscesses, who presents as a direct admission for enlarging
liver abscesses despite IV antibiotics
(ceftriaxone/metronidazole).

To recap her recent history, she was recently admitted ___
for acute cholangitis requiring plastic stent for stricture.
Cytology at that time with atypical crowded  granular epithelial
cells, some with mucinous changes in the background of acute
inflammation. She was treated with cefepime and flagyl for
presumed infectious cholangitis given leukocytosis, ultimately
completed 10 day course of ciprofloxacin + metronidazole.

She then was readmitted ___ for worsening RUQ pain. MRCP
revealed chronic sclerosing cholangitis with superimposed acute
cholangitis and development of few small abscesses, the largest
measuring 11 mm in the left lobe and 10 mm on the right lobe. 
She
underwent ERCP with stent removal. Previously dilated stricture
was not present.  Brushings were taken for cytology and FISH,
which were unremarkable and showed no evidence of malignancy. 
She
also had pouchoscopy which revealed an 8-mm polyp at ileoanal
anastomosis, which revealed inflammatory polyp on biopsy. She
ultimately was discharged with IV CTX 2g and metronidazole for 4
week course (end date to be ___. 

She had follow up with Dr. ___ on ___, and had repeat MRCP,
which revealed numerous liver microabscesses, many which have
increased in size, now measuring 2.7cm in L lobe of liver in
2.5cm abscess in R lobe as well as labs revealing worsening
transaminitis. She was then referred for direct admission for
consideration of diagnostic/ therapeutic tap of the largest
abscess.

Today, she shares that she has been feeling well since her last
discharge, with resolution of her abdominal pain. She has no
fevers or chills; no nausea. She continues to have chronic
diarrhea, ___ episodes a day, which she manages with loperamide;
this is improved from prior and recently has not noticed any
BRBPR. Denies any nausea/ vomiting. She notes that she would not
be in the hospital today had her hepatologist not called and
asked her to come in. She otherwise endorses a cough that is
intermittently productive of yellow sputum, that has been 
ongoing
for the past month or so; associated with some nasal congestion,
for which she takes guaifenesin-codeine and occasional Zyrtec
(which helps her runny nose).

ERCP ___
___ liver abscess aspiration ___

 
History of Present Illness:
Ms. ___ is a ___ yoF with hx of ulcerative colitis, primary
sclerosing cholangitis, sarcoidosis, and multiple recent
hospitalizations for cholangitis c/b sepsis and liver abscesses
s/p  ___ drainage, currently on IV ertapenem with planned course
ending on ___ who presents after ERCP today with stent
placement. 

To briefly recap her recent hospitalizations: She was first
admitted for acute cholangitis ___ for acute cholangitis
requiring plastic stent for stricture. Cytology at that time 
with
atypical crowded  granular epithelial cells, some with mucinous
changes in the background of acute inflammation. She was treated
with cefepime and flagyl for presumed infectious cholangitis
given leukocytosis, ultimately completed 10 day course of
ciprofloxacin + metronidazole.

She was then readmitted ___ for worsening RUQ pain. MRCP
revealed chronic sclerosing cholangitis with superimposed acute
cholangitis and development of few small abscesses, the largest
measuring 11 mm in the left lobe and 10 mm on the right lobe. 
She
underwent ERCP with stent removal. Previously dilated stricture
was not present.  Brushings were taken for cytology and FISH,
which were unremarkable and showed no evidence of malignancy. 
She
also had pouchoscopy which revealed an 8-mm polyp at ileoanal
anastomosis, which revealed inflammatory polyp on biopsy. She
ultimately was discharged with IV CTX 2g and metronidazole for 4
week course (end date to be ___. 

At follow up with Dr. ___ on ___, she had a repeat MRCP 
which
revealed numerous liver microabscesses, many which have 
increased
in size, now measuring 2.7cm in L lobe of liver in 2.5cm abscess
in R lobe as well as labs revealing worsening transaminitis. She
was then referred for direct admission for consideration of
diagnostic/ therapeutic tap of the largest abscess and was
hospitalized from ___. 

During hospitalization from ___. She underwent ___ aspiration
of the largest liver abscess which did not reveal any bacteria 
on
gram stain or culture. ID was consulted who recommended 
switching
from CTX/flagyl -> ertapenem 1g daily x4 weeks which was started
on ___, projected end date ___ but dependent on repeat imaging. 

She has since had repeat MRCP on  ___ which showed multiple 
small
micro abscesses within a cirrhotic liver some of which are
slightly larger in size as compared to prior study of ___.
No lesions suspicious for malignancy. 

She went for a scheduled ERCP today which revealed diffusely
narrowed CBD with several strictures in the distal ___ of the
CBD. Balloon dilation of the dominant stricture was unsuccessful
and so stent was placed. 

Recommendations from ERCP team: 
-Admit to hospital for monitoring
-Clear fluids when awake then advance diet as tolerated 
-Please consult Dr. ___ and Dr. ___ (ID) upon
admission
-Continue antibiotics - ertapenem 1g IV q24h - duration to be
dictated by ID
-Repeat ERCP in ___ weeks for stent removal and re-evaluation

On arrival to the floor, patient reports feeling well with no
complaints of abdominal pain, nausea/vomiting. She denies any
recent fevers/chills, chest pain, shortness of breath, cough,
dysuria. She continues to have diarrhea in the setting of her
ulcerative colitis. Denies any hematochezia or melena.

ACUTE MANAGEMENT:
==================
# Acute on chronic cholangitis complicated by liver abscess
# H/o Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis
Recently hospitalized for acute cholangitis s/p ERCP with 
plastic stent and 10-day IV antibiotic course. At that time, 
other than abdominal pain she had no fever or other symptoms. 
This admission she presented similarly. Was found on MRCP to 
have small abscess in right and left lobe of liver, concerning 
for inadequately treated infection from her prior admission. 
ERCP found that stricture noted during previous study was no 
longer present, plastic biliary stent was removed without 
replacement. EBUS found enlarged pancreatic LNs and one was 
biopsied, with path negative for any malignant cells. Cell 
brushings from bile duct showing atypical cells. Plan to treat 
empirically with 4 weeks of IV ceftriaxone and PO metronidazole.

# Hx atypical cells in ileal pouch. 
Underwent sigmoidoscopy while inpatient with biopsies of nodules 
taken. Path with benign results (inflammed polyp and inflamed 
hyperplastic polyp).

# Anemia of chronic disease
Presented with hgb 11, baseline appeared to be ___. Stable 
throughout hospital stay.

# Chronic Joint Pain 
# Osteoarthritis 
Held home meloxicam given bleeding risk now that she has early 
cirrhosis.

CHRONIC MANAGEMENT:
====================
# Sarcoidosis
Continued home hydroxychloroquine 200mg BID

# Chronic Diarrhea
Thought to be multifactorial in etiology, and attributable to 
history of ulcerative colitis, her hx of pouchitis, as well as 
irritable bowel syndrome and bile salt malabsorption. Continued 
home loperamide and home codeine-guaifenesin, which patient 
takes at bedtime to prevent diarrhea overnight.

# Bone Health 
# Vitamin D Deficiency 
Continued 2000U vitamin D daily
