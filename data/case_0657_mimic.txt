Brief Hospital Course:
___ with PMH significant for Crohn's disease, psychotic 
disorder NOS, presents for altered mental status. Admitted to 
medicine for workup of leukocytosis.
 
# Psychosis:
Patient carries a diagnosis of psychotic disorder NOS. His 
current delusions of "brain hacking" are consistent with his 
previous delusions. Upon speaking with his social worker and 
clinical nurse, the patient has been decompensating for quite 
some time. He was hospitalized in a psychiatric ward ___ months 
ago. The etiology of his decompensation may be secondary to 
narcotics abuse and medication noncompliance. Patient has 
admitted to buying narcotics online. Patient was prescribed 
risperdal consta 25mg as an outpatient, but failed to show up to 
his appointments. Given leukocytosis on admission, medical 
causes of psychosis were ruled out. This included negative 
blood, stool, and CSF cultures. Urinalysis was not concerning 
for infection. CT head and chest x-ray also did not reveal any 
abnormalities. Vitamin B12 was found slightly decreased. TSH, 
RPR, and HIV were negative. The patient was evaluated by 
psychiatry and met ___ criteria. He declined abilify on 
the medical floor. He will be discharged to inpatient 
psychiatry. The patient remained calm and cooperative during his 
hospitalization.

# Hyperbilirubinemia:
As evidenced by scleral icterus on admission. Tbili 2.9 on 
admission, direct 0.5, indirect 2.4. His RUQ did not reveal any 
signs of obstruction. Hemolysis workup was negative. His 
nutritional status is unclear and it is possible the patient may 
have ___ disease. His bilirubin downtrended during his 
hospitalization.

# Leukocytosis:
Noted on admission labs. Patient without localizing infectious 
symptoms except for increased stool output. He otherwise 
appeared well and vital signs were reassuring. Blood, stool, and 
CSF cultures are negative to date. Urinalysis was not concerning 
for infection. His WBC trended down to the normal range on day 2 
of hospitalization with fluid administration. It is likely that 
he was volume depleted.

# Contact dermatitis:
Pt developed an erythematous maculopapular rash on the volar 
surfaces of both arms, thought likely secondary to alcohol-based 
swabs used to clean the areas prior to lab draws and peripheral 
IV placement. The only new medication that was started here was 
vitamin B12 supplementation, so this was stopped. However, pt is 
vitamin B12 deficient, and so would recommend re-starting this 
as soon as his rash resolves and watch for recurrence. If no 
recurrence, would continue supplementation.
 
# Acute kidney injury:
Cr increased to 2.2, baseline Cr 1.47 (in ___. Etiology 
likely pre-renal given increased stool output and poor 
nutrition, further supported by hemoconcentration. His urine 
electrolytes and osmolality were also consistent with 
dehydration. His Cr trended below baseline with IVF. 

# Crohn's disease:
Patient with increased stool output, but with negative stool 
cultures. He otherwise did not complain of any other symptoms. 
The patient self-administers Humira every ___.

therefore he missed his dose on ___.
