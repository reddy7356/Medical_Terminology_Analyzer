Brief Hospital Course:
Patient admitted for possible cardiac catheterization following 
new changes on outpatient EKG and ischemic changes on outpatient 
stress test. He described no symptoms over the last 2 weeks or 
at the current time. Labs and repeat EKG in ED showed troponins 
< 0.01 and evidence of an old septal infarct (new since 
___, results that indicated it was highly unlikely that 
the patient was currently having a myocardial infarction, but 
that he may have had one in the last year. He was admitted to 
___ for possible cardiac catheterization.

Cardiac catheterization was done via the right femoral artery 
and the patient tolerated the procedure well. A stent was placed 
in the first diagonal artery off of the left anterior descending 
coronary artery. Post-cath check was done in the evening 
following the procedure and indicated no signs of a bleed, 
hematoma, or bruits. The patient was started on the appropriate 
antithrombotic regimen for discharge and will be following up as 
an outpatient with both Dr. ___ new cardiologist and 
Dr. ___ PCP.

Mr. ___ had elevated blood pressures on admission and his 
hypertensive medication regimen was modified in addition to the 
new coronary artery disease regimen that we initiated.

Lastly, Mr. ___ has chronic renal insufficiency with a 
baseline Cr of 1.6-1.8. He was within this baseline during his 
stay here, but should have a follow-up Cr measurement as an 
outpatient as we increased his dose of Lisinopril to 20 mg daily 
from 10 mg daily. A prescription for this blood draw was given 
on discharge.
 
Medications on Admission:
Loratadine 10 mg PO daily  
Lisinopril 10 mg PO daily

Discharge Instructions:
Mr. ___, you were admitted to ___ 
___ for evaluation of your heart. When you were 
seeing your primary doctor the other day, they noted that you 
had some new changes on your EKG. At that point, they referred 
you to have a stress test which looked at your heart's ability 
to deal with stress. The stress test showed some problems with 
the blood flow to a certain area of your heart, possibly due to 
a heart attack that occurred in the recent past. From the stress 
test, you were referred to ___ where you were admitted to the 
cardiology service for possible cardiac catheterization. After 
discussing you case with all of the doctors, your mother, and 
you, it was decided that we would proceed with the cardiac cath. 
The procedure went very well and a stent was placed in one of 
your heart's blood vessels to keep it open and maximize blood 
flow. You are being discharged to your home today.

The following changes were made to your medication regimen:

-Start Simvastatin 20 mg daily
-Start Aspirin 325 mg daily
-Start Plavix 75 mg daily
-Start Metoprolol succinate 25 mg daily
-Increase Lisinopril to 20 mg daily
-Continue Loratadine 10 mg daily  
-Continue Flomax 0.4 mg daily 
-Continue Calcitriol 0.25 mg every OTHER day

Mr. ___, it is so very important that you take your 
Aspirin and Plavix daily. These medication will keep your stent 
healthy. If you do not take these 2 medications daily, you have 
a large risk of sustaining another, much larger heart attack. 
Please do not miss ___ dose.
 
Followup Instructions:
___
