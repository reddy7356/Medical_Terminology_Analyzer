IMAGING
CXR ___
Frontal and lateral views of the chest demonstrate low lung 
volumes.  No
pleural effusion, focal consolidation or pneumothorax is seen.  
Hilar and
mediastinal silhouettes are unchanged.  Heart size is top 
normal.  Aorta
appears slightly tortuous with aortic arch calcifications.  The 
increased size
of a large hiatal hernia is exaggerated by lower lung volumes 
than in ___. 
Compression deformity of L1 vertebral body is chronic.
 
IMPRESSION:
 
No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary process.

CT ABD/PELVIS ___
1.  Approximately 10 cm segment of the distal ileum/cecum, which 
demonstrates
marked bowel wall thickening.  There is no significant fat 
stranding or fluid
adjacent to this bowel loop.  The differential considerations 
include
infection, inflammation or ischemia of subacute/chronic nature.  
Underlying
mass lesion is also considered due to lack of associated 
stranding and acute
inflammatory changes.
2.  Large hiatal hernia. 
3.  Extensive calcified atherosclerotic disease of the aorta and 
its branches
without associated aneurysmal changes.
4.  Compression deformities of L5 and L1 vertebral bodies with 
associated
sclerosis, likely chronic.
5.  Fibroid uterus.
6.  Intermediate density renal lesions, which can be further 
assessed with
renal ultrasound on non-emergent basis.  There is a 1.5 x 1.2 cm 
hypodense lesion in the lower pole of the left kidney measuring 
50 Hounsfield units in attenuation (2:34) there is a
1 x 1 cm hypodensity in the lower pole of the right kidney 
measuring 72
Hounsfield units (2:37).
 
 

MICRO:

            **FINAL REPORT ___

   C. difficile DNA amplification assay (Final ___: 
      Negative for toxigenic C. difficile by the Illumigene DNA
      amplification assay. 
           (Reference Range-Negative). 

   FECAL CULTURE (Final ___:    NO SALMONELLA OR SHIGELLA 
FOUND. 

   CAMPYLOBACTER CULTURE (Final ___:    NO CAMPYLOBACTER 
FOUND. 

   FECAL CULTURE - R/O YERSINIA (Final ___:    NO YERSINIA 
FOUND. 

   FECAL CULTURE - R/O E.COLI 0157:H7 (Final ___: 
      NO E.COLI 0157:H7 FOUND. 
 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ with PMH sigmoid diverticulosis, hypothryoidism presents 
with 2 weeks of abd pain, new onset diarrhea, and transient 
nausea with elevated WBC ct, concentrated urine, and imaging 
colitis in ileal-cecal area c/f infectious vs. ischemic colitis.

ACTIVE ISSUES:
# Abd pain: In ___ with new onset acute abdominal pain, the 
initial concern was for ischemic vs. infectious colitis. 
Ischemic picture is supported by pt's known calcific lesions in 
aorta, suggesting possibility of vessel narrowing disease or 
atheroembolic disease. Pt was given IVF gently and never had 
abdominal pain during hospitalization. Pt's UA with specific 
gravity of 1.040 was suggestive of concentrated urine indicating 
possibly hypovelemia. Ms ___ may have had infectious colitis, 
given elevated WBC count. Pt was given cipro/flagyl in the ED 
for possible infectious colitis. Pt was continued on treatment 
for infectious colitis with ciprofloxacin and flagyl. After pt 
was discharged, stool cultures for C. diff, salmonella, 
shigella, campylobacter later returned negative. Surgery was 
initially consulted in the ED and followed briefly while patient 
was inpatient, however, as the patient improved with 
conservative measures, it became clear that pt would not require 
surgical intervention.

CHRONIC ISSUES
# Hypothyroidism: Pt was continued on 137mcg/day po 
levothyroxine

TRANSITION ISSUES:
# CT abdomen showed incidental renal lesions, described as 
:intermediate density renal lesions", which can be further 
assessed with renal ultrasound on non-emergent basis
# Based on pt's likely ischemic colitis, we would recommend 
further discussion regarding need for outpatient colonoscopy to 
assess for presence of mass
# Three blood cultures are pending

# Code: Full (discussed with patient)  
# Communication: Patient   
# Emergency Contact:   Daughter ___ = ___

Discharge Instructions:
Dear ___

___ was a pleasure taking care of you at ___. You were admitted

improved during your stay, and we discharged you after you were 
able to eat. Please continue to take the antibiotics as 
prescribed through ___.

We would like you to follow-up with you primary care doctor to
