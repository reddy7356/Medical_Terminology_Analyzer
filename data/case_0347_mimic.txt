Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ is a ___ with history of mild mental retardation, 
dysarthria, and T2DM on glipizide now presenting with altered 
mental status.

# Hypoglycemia:
She was found to be hypoglycemic to the 20___ in the ED in the 
setting of sulfonylurea use and CKD. BG improved appropriately 
with D50. Toxicology was consulted, and given her sulfonylurea 
use she received 2 doses of octreotide. Finger sticks were 
monitored every four hours and she had no further hypoglycemic 
episodes. Oral antihyperglycemics were initially held and 
resumed on HD3. In consultation with ___ diabetes 
consultants, plan was made to resume glipizide at lower dose (5 
mg daily).

# UTI:
She was also noted to have UA consistent with UTI in setting of 
fatigue/confusion/hypoglycemia. She completed 3 day course of 
ciprofloxacin for treatment of UTI.

# Elevated LFTs:
She had LFTs mildly elevated above baseline, no 
nausea/vomiting/abd pain/diarrhea/constipation/fevers. LFTs 
subsequently downtrended and can be followed further in the 
outpatient setting.

CHRONIC ISSUES:
# Osteoporosis:
- On alendronate, continued at discharge

# HLD: 
- Continued atorvastatin

# HTN: BP remains well-controlled. 
- Continued losartan
- Continued metoprolol 

TRANSITION ISSUES:
# She completed a 3 day course of ciprofloxacin for UTI (last 
day ___.
# Her glipizide dose was reduced (discharged on 5mg daily) and 
repaglinide was held in setting of hypoglycemia. Her glycemic 
control will need close followup after discharge. Given history 
of hypoglycemia she may benefit from initiation of sitagliptin 
in the outpatient setting.
# Will need assistance arranging medication packaging such as 
bubble wrapping to increase medication compliance and avoid 
errors. 
# She was noted to have LFTs mildly elevated above baseline, 
which subsequently improved. Will need LFTs rechecked as an 
outpatient and if transaminitis persists, this may be further 
evaluated by RUQUS.
