presented with hypertensive emergency in setting of medication 
non-compliance with mild pulmonary edema and NSTEMI. 

# H/o HTN
# Hypertensive Emergency: Presented with systolics in the 220's 
with NSTEMI and pulmonary edema. Medication non-compliance after 
the passing of his father. Started on a nitro gtt in ED with 
quick improvement, SBP's down to 168. No neurologic symptoms 
with correction of hypertension. Patient endorsed non-compliance 
with blood pressure medications since ___. He stated that 
his prior PCP terminated him from her office ___ making 
appointments. His blood pressures were controlled with home 
lisinopril 40 mg daily, home imdur 60 mg daily, and 45 mg 
nifedipine BID. HCTZ 25 mg was added. Medications should be 
titrated as an outpatient to minimize medications, but maximize 
dosages for goal SBP < 130 in setting of prior non-compliance. 

# Acute Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure: 
# Acute Heart Failure with Preserved Ejection fraction
# Pulmonary edema 
# Severe mitral regurgitation 
Mild-Moderate pulmonary edema in setting of hypertensive 
emergency and elevation of BNP. Responded well to afterload 
reduction and Lasix. TTE completed that showed severe MR, thus 
afterload reduction and volume reduction beneficial. Sent home 
on HCTZ 25 mg daily for volume management. Euvolemic on 
discharge. 

# NSTEMI: Likely T2 NSTEMI in setting of hypertensive emergency 
and medication non-compliance. Treated with metoprolol and 
lisinopril. Metoprolol uptitrated from home dose. Would likely 
benefit from an outpatient stress test and based on the result 
possibly a non-urgent cath.

CHRONIC ISSUES
-----------------
# IDDM: held home metformin while inpatient

# PVD: Changed to 81 mg ASA

# HLD: Continued high dose statin

# Tobacco Use: Nicotine patch
