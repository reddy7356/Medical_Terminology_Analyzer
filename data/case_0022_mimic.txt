Discharge Instructions:
Postoperative instructions following jaw surgery

Wound care: Do not disturb or probe the surgical area with any 
objects. The sutures placed in your mouth are usually the type 
that self dissolve. If you have any sutures on the skin of your 
face or neck, your surgeon will remove them on the day of your 
first follow up appointment. SMOKING is detrimental to healing 
and will cause complications.

Bleeding: Intermittent bleeding or oozing overnight is normal. 
Placing fresh gauze over the area and biting on the gauze for 
___ minutes at a time may control the bleeding. If you had 
nasal surgery, you may have occasional slow oozing from your 
nostril for the first ___ days. Bleeding should never be severe. 
If bleeding persists or is severe or uncontrollable, please call 
our office immediately. If it is after normal business hours, 
please come to the emergency room and request that the oral 
surgery resident on call be paged.

___: Normal healing after oral surgery should be as follows: 
the first ___ days after surgery, are generally the most 
uncomfortable and there is usually significant swelling. After 
the first week, you should be more comfortable. The remainder of 
your postoperative course should be gradual, steady improvement. 
If you do not see continued improvement, please call our office.

Physical activity: It is recommended that you not perform any 
strenuous physical activity for a few weeks after surgery. Do 
not lift any heavy loads and avoid physical sports unless you 
obtain permission from your surgeon.

Swelling & Ice applications: Swelling is often associated with 
surgery. Swelling can be minimized by using a cold pack, ice bag 
or a bag of frozen peas wrapped in a towel, with firm 
application to face and neck areas. This should be applied 20 
minutes on and 20 minutes off during the first ___ days after 
surgery. If you have been given medicine to control the 
swelling, be sure to take it as directed.

Hot applications: Starting on the ___ or ___ day after surgery, 
you may apply warm compresses to the skin over the areas of 
swelling (hot water bottle wrapped in a towel, etc), for 20 
minutes on and 20 min off to help soothe tender areas and help 
to decrease swelling and stiffness. Please use caution when 
applying ice or heat to your face as certain areas may feel numb 
after surgery and extremes of temperature may cause serious 
damage.

Tooth brushing: Begin your normal oral hygiene the day after 
surgery. Soreness and swelling may nor permit vigorous brushing, 
but please make every effort to clean your teeth with the bounds 
of comfort. Any toothpaste is acceptable. Please remember that 
your gums may be numb after surgery. To avoid injury to the gums 
during brushing, use a child size toothbrush and brush in front 
of a mirror staying only on teeth.

Mouth rinses: Keeping your mouth clean after surgery is 
essential. Use 1 teaspoon of salt dissolved in an 8 ounce glass 
of warm water and gently rinse with portions of the solution, 
taking 5 min to use the entire glassful. Repeat as often as you 
like, but you should do this at least 4 times each day. If your 
surgeon has prescribed a specific rinse, use as directed.

Showering: You may shower ___ days after surgery, but please ask 
your surgeon about this. If you have any incisions on the skin 
of your face or body, you should cover them with a water 
resistant dressing while showering. DO NOT SOAK SURGICAL SITES. 
This will avoid getting the area excessively wet. As you may 
physically feel weak after surgery, initially avoid extreme hot 
or cold showers, as these may cause some patients to pass out. 
Also it is a good idea to make sure someone is available to 
assist you in case if you may need help.
