Initially suspected viral illness, particularly as initial CXR 
was without acute process. However, interval CXR obtained in 
setting of persistent fevers and worsening RLL crackles notable

and poor appetite. Torsemide HELD and patient given 1L IVF with 
resolution of ___. Torsemide held on discharge with instructions 
to resume if his weight increased or if he developed ___ 
swelling. Discharge weight: 167.7 lb.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,

It was a privilege to care for you at the ___ 
___. You were admitted for further evaluation of 
cough and fever. Your second chest x-ray showed evidence of a 
developing pneumonia and therefore you were started on 
antibiotics. You will need to complete an additional three days 
of treatment and will follow up with Dr. ___ to ensure that 
you continue to recover.  

While you are recovering from an infection, it is easy to become 
dehydrated. Therefore we are holding your Lasix until you see 
Dr. ___. You should weigh yourself immediately when you get 
home and if your weight increases by more than 2 lbs in one day 
or 5 lbs in one week, then you should resume your Lasix to 
prevent further fluid accumulation.

Please also know that antibiotics can cause your INR to become 
higher. Per discussion with our pharmacist, you should take 4mg 
of warfarin daily until your INR is repeated at your PCP follow 
up next week. 

We wish you the best! 

Sincerely,

Your ___ Team

PERTINENT STUDIES
========================
CT HEAD (___)
Adjacent hypodense areas in the posterior left occipital lobe 
could represent 
subacute infarcts, less likely small masses with surrounding 
edema.  Consider 
further evaluation with MRI. 

MRI HEAD (___)
1.  Study is moderately degraded by motion. 
2. Scattered probable late acute to early subacute infarcts 
involving the left 
occipital lobe, posterolateral left thalamus, and the bilateral 
frontal and 
parietal lobes.  The overall distribution is concerning for 
central embolic 
source. 
3. Please note that areas of enhancement are compatible with 
evolving 
infarcts, underlying enhancing lesions are not excluded on the 
basis 
examination.  Recommend follow-up imaging to resolution. 
4. No definite evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage. 
5. Left medial occipital foci of mineralization versus chronic 
blood products 
as described. 
6. Filling defects within the left sigmoid sinus, with patency 
of the left 
transverse sinus and left internal jugular vein.  Findings 
remain is concern 
for nonocclusive thrombus within the left sigmoid sinus. 
7. Global parenchymal volume loss and evidence of chronic small 
vessel 
ischemic disease. 
 
MRA BRAIN (___)
The intracranial vertebral and internal carotid arteries and 
their major 
branches appear patent without evidence of stenosis, occlusion, 
or aneurysm 
formation. 
  
MRA NECK (___)
The visualized portions of the common, internal and external 
carotid arteries appear grossly patent.  There is no evidence of 
internal carotid artery  stenosis by NASCET criteria.  The 
vertebral basilar system is right-sided  dominant, a normal 
variant.  The vertebral arteries remain grossly patent through 
their course. 

LOWER EXTREMITY DOPPLER (___)
No evidence of deep venous thrombosis in the right or left lower 
extremity 
veins. 
 
RENAL US (___)
Unchanged mild-to-moderate bilateral hydronephrosis.  No renal 
stones are 
visualized. 
 
CT HEAD (___)
Tiny evolving infarcts, as described above, though some of the 
areas as seen on the prior MR are not visualized on CT.  No new 
acute intracranial 
abnormality.  No intracranial hemorrhage. 
 
MRI HEAD (___)
1. New 0.8 cm focus of restricted diffusion in the left 
cerebellar hemisphere 
is compatible with early acute infarction. 
2. Re-demonstration of multiple areas of evolving infarction in 
the bilateral 
cerebral hemispheres and posterolateral left thalamus, with 
interval 
development of microhemorrhages in an infarcted area in the 
medial left 
occipital lobe. 
3. Areas of parenchymal enhancement are again seen and are 
compatible with 
evolving infarcts, however underlying enhancing lesions cannot 
be excluded on 
the basis of this examination.  As noted before, follow-up 
imaging to 
resolution is recommended. 
4. Similar appearance of filling defects in the left sigmoid 
sinus remain 
concerning for nonocclusive thrombus. 
5. Loss of the normal T1 marrow signal of the C3 vertebral body, 
incompletely 
evaluated on the current exam.  MRI of the cervical spine may be 
helpful for 
further evaluation. 

ECHO (___)
IMPRESSION: Posterior leaflet mitral valve prolapse with 
moderate mitral regurgitation. Mild
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size 
and regional/global biventricular systolic
function. Mildly dilated aortic arch.

 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ man with history of atrial fibrillation and newly 
diagnosed metastatic prostate cancer presenting for fatigue, 
weakness, and ___, discovered to have multiple acute-subacute 
CVAs.

# MULTIFOCAL SUBACUTE CVAs
# POSSIBLE LEFT SIGMOID SINUS THROMBUS
Initially presented with symptoms of mild confusion/inattention. 
Underwent CT head and MRI brain demonstrating scattered subacute 
infarcts of possibly cardioembolic source, in addition to 
filling defect within the left sigmoid sinus raising possibility 
of non-occlusive thrombus. No significant residual deficits were 
identified despite these infarcts. Occurred in setting of brief 
discontinuation of rivaroxaban for procedure. Underwent further 
evaluation including MRA head/neck which was normal. A1c, lipid 
panel, and TSH all within normal limits. Given association with 
new diagnosis of metastatic cancer, was initiated on Lovenox 
therapeutic dosing. Course notable for subsequent episode of 
transient right eye blurriness which spontaneously resolved in 
___ minutes. Repeat CT unchanged; repeat MRI ___ demonstrated 
a new L cerebellar infarction, microhemorrhage around medial 
left occipital infarctions and stable sigmoid sinus thrombus. 
MRI findings from ___ were discussed with neurology team and it 
was determined patient was still stable to be discharged on 
lovenox given risk of embolic stroke. Arranged to follow up with 
stroke neurologist as outpatient on a non-urgent basis following 
discharged.

# ACUTE RENAL FAILURE
Presenting labs notable for markedly elevated serum creatinine 
consistent with acute kidney injury. Renal ultrasound 
demonstrated bilateral moderate hydronephrosis with recent 
symptoms of difficulty voiding c/w obstructive ___. Underwent 
Foley placement with adequate urine drainage. Foley was removed 
___ an patient had successful voiding trial. Concern for 
pre-renal hypovolemic component in the setting of poor PO intake 
and tachycardia/hypovolemia on exam, thus patient received IVF 
boluses. Interval renal US continued to demonstrate 
mild-moderate hydronephrosis, overall suggestive of partial 
ureteral obstruction possibly due to malignancy. Unable to 
obtain CT abdomen at this time given acute kidney injury. 
Evaluated by urology who recommended against ureteral stenting 
in the acute setting, though will plan to follow closely as 
outpatient following discharge. Discharge Cr 2.1,

# METASTATIC PROSTATE CANCER
# DIFFUSE OSSEOUS LESIONS
Shortly prior to admission underwent prostate biopsy with 
pathology demonstrating high-grade prostate adenocarcinoma. 
Recent MRI L-spine obtained as outpatient demonstrating 
extensive osseous lesions of the spine. Diffuse weakness though 
no evidence of acute cord compression. Was evaluated by oncology 
in-house with plan to start casodex ___ mg QD with close oncology 
follow up for further management. 

# ATRIAL FIBRILLATION
Xarelto recently held prior to prostate biopsy, possibly 
contributing to newly discovered CVAs. Previously not on rate 
control, though HR frequently >130 during admission. Responded 
appropriately to fluid bolus (dry given recently decreased PO 
intake) in addition to starting metoprolol succinate for goal HR 
<110.

# CONSTIPATION
In setting of recent opiates for cancer-associated pain. 
Resolved with aggressive bowel regimen.
