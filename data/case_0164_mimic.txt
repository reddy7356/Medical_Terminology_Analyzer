throughout. 
There is no evidence of focal lesions.  There is no evidence of 
intrahepatic or extrahepatic biliary dilatation.  The 
gallbladder is within normal limits.
 
PANCREAS: The pancreas has normal attenuation throughout, 
without evidence of focal lesions or pancreatic ductal 
dilatation. There is no peripancreatic stranding.

without
evidence of focal lesions.
 
ADRENALS:  The right and left adrenal glands are normal in size 
and shape.
 
URINARY: The kidneys are of normal and symmetric size with 
normal nephrogram. There is no evidence of focal renal lesions 
or hydronephrosis. There is no perinephric abnormality.
 
GASTROINTESTINAL: The stomach is unremarkable.  Small bowel 
loops demonstrate normal caliber, wall thickness, and 
enhancement throughout.  The colon and rectum are within normal 
limits.  There is no free intraperitoneal fluid or free air.
 
PELVIS:
The urinary bladder and distal ureters are unremarkable.  There 
is no free fluid in the pelvis.

LYMPH NODES: There is no retroperitoneal or mesenteric 
lymphadenopathy.  There is no pelvic or inguinal 
lymphadenopathy.
 
VASCULAR: There is no abdominal aortic aneurysm.  Widely patent 
celiac axis, SMA, and ___.  Mild to moderate atherosclerotic 
disease is noted.
 
BONES AND SOFT TISSUES: There is no evidence of worrisome 
osseous lesions or acute fracture.  The abdominal and pelvic 
wall is within normal limits.
 
IMPRESSION:
1. No acute intrathoracic or intra-abdominal pathology.  
Specifically, no
acute aortic pathology.
2. Mild emphysematous changes.

___ EXERCISE MIBI
STRESS
INTERPRETATION: This ___ yo man with h/o HTN, HLD, IDDM, and 
smoking
was referred to the lab from the inpatient floor following 
negative
serial cardiac enzymes for evaluation of chest discomfort. The 
patient
exercised for 12.5 minutes of a Modified ___ protocol and was 
stopped
for fatigue. The estimated peak MET capacity was 10.6, which 
represents
an average exercise tolerance for his age. There were no reports 
of
chest, back, neck, or arm discomforts during the study. There 
were no
significant ST changes noted during exercise or recovery. Rhythm 
was
sinus with no ectopy. There was a blunted heart rate response to
exercise in the presence of beta blockade. There was an 
appropriate
blood pressure response during exercise and recovery.
IMPRESSION: No anginal type symptoms or ischemic EKG changes. 
Average
functional capacity. Nuclear report sent separately.

PERFUSION
FINDINGS:
 
The image quality is adequate but limited due to soft tissue 
attenuation.  
 
Left ventricular cavity size is normal.  
 
Resting and stress perfusion images reveal uniform tracer uptake 
throughout the
left ventricular myocardium.
 
Gated images reveal normal wall motion.
 
The calculated left ventricular ejection fraction is 54% with an 
EDV of 95 ml.
 
IMPRESSION:
 
1. Normal myocardial perfusion at the level of exercise 
achieved.
 
2. Normal left ventricular cavity size and systolic function.  
 
In the setting of diabetes, normal myocardial perfusion does not 
necessarily
imply a low risk of adverse cardiac events.
 
Brief Hospital Course:
SUMMARY STATEMENT:
====================
___ is a ___ current every day smoker, with IDDM 
(A1c 11.5) p/w 3 days of chest pain that radiates to his back, 
shoulders, and head. CTA performed in the ED ruled out aortic 
dissection, trops negative x3, due to symptoms concerning for 
unstable angina he underwent exercise nuclear stress test which 
did not identify any reversible perfusion defects. Due to 
suboptimal study (approx. 12 minutes on modified ___ protocol) 
he was discharged home with instructions to follow up as 
outpatient for stress echo and in cardiology clinic.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
====================
[] Stress echo scheduled for ___ at 8 am

[] Cardiology follow up scheduled with Dr. ___.

ACTIVE ISSUES:
==============
#Chest pain
Patient stated that he has had this pain in the past. About ___ 
years ago, he was admitted to ___ with similar symptoms but had 
a negative cardiac workup including negative echo stress test. 
The symptoms ultimately resolved but had similar symptoms 3 days 
ago and have been progressively getting worse. The pain started 
while he was shampooing his carpet two days prior to admission. 
The symptoms again worsened when he was walking outside to the 
bus stop to get to work in the AM, an approximate distance of 50 
meters. These episodes of pain are associated with 
lightheadedness, pleuritic chest pain, nausea and dizziness 
which are worse with exertion and resolved with rest. He denies 
fever, diarrhea, abdominal pain. Denies cough, hemoptysis, 
recent long travel, unilateral ___ edema or tenderness. Troponins 
were <0.01 x3. CXR in the ED did not demonstrate any acute 
intrathoracic process. subsequent CTA showed no acute 
intrathoracic or intra-abdominal pathology. There was mild 
emphysematous changes and moderate atherosclerotic disease. He 
underwent a modified ___ protocol, whereby he was on the 
treadmill for 12.5 minute and achieved a 56% target heart rate. 
Nuclear imaging showed no diffusion defects and no ECG changes 
were observed. Due to suboptimal study conditions (patient had 
taken beta blocker that morning) he was discharged home with 
plan to follow up as outpatient for repeat stress echo.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,

It was a pleasure taking care of you at ___ 
___.

WHY WAS I ADMITTED TO THE HOSPITAL?
- You were admitted to the hospital because you had episodes of 
chest pain, lightheadedness and difficulty breathing.

WHAT HAPPENED WHILE I WAS IN THE HOSPITAL?
- In the hospital, we performed some imaging of your chest and 
heart, which were reassuring. Given that these episodes have 
happened before, we also performed a stress test to see if there 
were any changes in the electrical rhythm of your heart during 
exercise or decreased flow of blood through your arteries. Both 
of these studies did not show any abnormalities.

WHAT SHOULD I DO WHEN I GO HOME?
- Please take all of your medications exactly as prescribed and 
attend all of your follow-up appointments listed below.

- You will have a stress test as an outpatient next week.

We wish you the best!
Your ___ Care Team 
 
Followup Instructions:
