Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ underwent robotic minimally invasive cholecystectomy 
with side-to-side roux-en-y cholejejunostomy on ___ by Dr. 
___.  The procedure went well, without complications however 
significant abdominal adhesions were present (please see the 
operative note for details). Estimated blood loss was 25cc, 
urine output 150cc, and he received 2000cc crystalloid fluid. No 
evidence of liver metastasis was found.  The patient had low 
urine output in the OR (150 cc) and an elevated creatine 
afterwards (1.7 from 1.0 preop) and was bolused 500cc.  On POD1 
his creatinine improved to 1.2. His WBC decreased from 16.4 
post-op to 10.6 the following day. His hemoglobin was stable. 

Aside from this, his post operative course has been uneventful.  
He remained hemodynamically stable and afebrile throughout the 
post-operative period. On POD1 his NG tube was removed and he 
was started on SIPS.  On POD2 his home meds were started and he 
began a clear liquid diet which he tolerated well.  POD3 his 
foley was removed and he voided spontaneously and his PTC drain 
was capped. POD4 he was advanced to a full liquid diet which he 
tolerated and his ___ drain was removed.  POD5 he continued to 
tolerate full liquids, was ambulating without assistance in the 
halls, voided spontaneously, was passing flatus, and expressed 
his desire and readiness for discharge home. He lives in the 
same building as his son who will help with care. He does not 
need additional therapy or nursing care at home. He should keep 
the PTC capped until follow up in 2 weeks with Dr. ___. He has
