Brief Hospital Course:

headache and foley discomfort, found to have a catheter 
associated urinary tract infection. 

# Catheter associated urinary tract infection: Complicated UTI. 
With leukocytosis and mild tachycardia that resolved upon 
arrival to the floor. It is unclear why he has an indwelling 
foley, though he reports this is how his BPH has been managed

be crucial
in ongoing outpatient care. S/p 1 dose of ceftriaxone in ED, 
transitioned to ___. 

Patient feeling well and remained hemodynamically stable, 
headache and tachycardia improved/resolved. Discussed with 
family who wished to bring him there tomorrow morning. Given his

ongoing hospital care. He was transitioned to ciprofloxacin 
500mg PO BID to complete total 7 day course pending further 
culture data. Discussed with future PCP. Reinforced to patient 
and family importance of PCP ___. 

# Depression/Chronic fatigue syndrome: Not taking any
