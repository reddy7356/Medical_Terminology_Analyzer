Attending: ___.
 
Chief Complaint:
right hip abscess
 
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
___ Washout with drainage deep abscess, right hip.

 
History of Present Illness:
The patient is a ___ y/o M with R THR who was admitted last month 
after sustaining a proximal femur fracture around the site of 
the hemiarthroplasty. He underwent ORIF of the fracture on ___. 
He was seen in ___ clinic on ___ and was found to have green 
drainage from the wound. He went to the OR on ___ for washout, 
where an abscess was found, which was just above the tensor 
fascia ___ and did not appear to track deep around any of the 
metalwork or total hip replacement, per the operative note.  

On ___, the patient triggered at 0420 in the morning for not 
speaking, following comands, or responding to questions. An 
urgent head CT showed no changes. Neurology saw him and 
summarized,  
___ yo man with PMH of afib, ?epilepsy (unclear seizure type) 
and history of R hip hemiarthroplasty and periprosthetic 
fracture after a fall with recent ORIF on ___ c/b wound 
infection who presented for a washout of his infected right hip. 
He was being seen in ___ clinic on ___ and purulent 
discharge was noted from the wound. He underwent I&D yesterday 
and was "normal" and "oriented" post-operatively with last well 
known time at 12:30 am. At 4 am, was found to be awake but not 
responding to the nurse. He would look around as if he were 
seeing things but would not talk to her and when she was talking 
to him or holding up a question, he wouldn't answer the 
questions. When he did start talking about ___ minutes later, 
his speech sounded slurred so he was triggered for "altered 
mental status." No previously documented neurological 
examination for comparison, but per nursing, very hard of 
hearing at baseline and has been partly communicating via 
writing on the paper at bedside (then patient reads it)." Their 
differential included seizures, TIA, and delirium.  

The patient is also having bradycardia nightly. He is 
asymptomatic, and his heart rate improves with stimulation.  

ROS:  
(+) Per HPI  
(-) Denies fever, chills, night sweats, recent weight loss or 
gain. Denies headache, sinus tenderness, rhinorrhea or 
congestion. Denied cough, shortness of breath. Denied chest pain 
or tightness, palpitations. Denied nausea, vomiting, diarrhea,

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient is a ___ man with a history of hypertension, 
atrial fibrillation, and distant history of seizures who 
presented after being found to be draining from a hip wound.  
.
# Right hip abscess: Patient presented with drainage from hip 
wound, taken to OR for washout with Dr. ___ showed 
abscess although with no involvement of hardware. Swabs were 
sent, which grew PSEUDOMONAS AERUGINOSA (pansensitive), 
___ (pansensitive), PROBABLE ENTEROCOCCUS (see 
results section).  Infectious disease was therefore consulted. 
Patient was treated with vancomycin and cefepime initially and 
then transitioned to ciprofloxacin monotherapy after return of 
cultures. Patient was also evaluated by physical therapy who 
recommended discharge to rehab. Patient will follow up with 
orthopedics as an outpatient.
.
# Bradycardia: Patient was transferred to the medicine service 
mid-admission after washout largely because of bradycardia. 
Discussion with patient's HCP (daughter) suggested that patient 
has been bradycardic for some time and is frequently in the ___ 
and asymptomatic at home. Medicine evaluated the patient and 
felt that it was likely atrial fibrillation with slow 
ventricular response with high suspicion for sick sinus 
syndrome. Patient was asymptomatic and mentating well throughout 
admission without events on telemetry. 
.
# Urinary tract infection: Patient noted to have urine culture 
growing ___ Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Patient was covered 
for UTI with his antibiotics for his abscess above. Patient 
should have repeat UA after completing treatment to ensure 
clearance.
.
# Toxic/metabolic encephalopathy: Patient had an episode of 
altered mental status in the middle of the night, mid-admission. 
Patient was noted to be staring off into space and 
uninteractive. Discussion with daughter noted that patient, in 
fact, has done this on several occasions in the past, although 
with decreasing frequency after starting Keppra. It is possible 
that this was seizure with postictal state. Neurology was also 
consulted who suggested this was likely hypoactive delirium in 
context of infection described above. Patient thereafter 
remained at his baseline mental status.
.
# Disordered oropharyngeal swallowing: Patient with known 
history of this. Noted again to be coughing with POs during this 
hospitalization. Speech and swallow reconsulted and 
videooropharyngeal swallow performed, which showed risk of 
aspiration with all diets. Recommended pureed solid and honey 
thickened liquid diet. Risk of aspiration, despite dietary 
adjustment, discussed with patient's HCP (Daughter ___. She 
related that she has had this discussion before and understood 
the risks/benefits delineated by me (Dr. ___ during the 
call. Patient discharged with aspiration precautions and 
conservative diet for purposes of rehabilitation. 
.
# ?CHF: Patient evidently on furosemide at home.  We continued 
his furosemide here.
.
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES
- Patient treated initially with vancomycin/cefepime for 
treatment of hip abscess, thereafter transitioned to PO cipro 
under infectious disease team recommendations. Continue cipro 
until ___.
- Patient evaluated by neurology for altered mental status, who 
suspected toxic/metabolic encephalopathy secondary to infectious 
process, but also consideration for atypical seizure activity

Discharge Instructions:
Mr. ___:

It was a pleasure to take care of you. 

You were admitted to the hospital from clinic because you were 
found to have green drainage from your hip wound site. You were 
taken to the operative room by orthopedic surgery for a washout, 
where an abscess (localized infection) was found. You were also 
incidentally noted to have a urinary tract infection. We treated 
you with intravenous antibiotics, with guidance of our 
infectious disease doctors. ___, we transitioned you to 
an oral regimen and discharged you to rehab.

Our neurologists also saw you while you were an inpatient 
because of an episode of confusion/altered mental status. They 
felt that your confusion was likely due to the infection, 
although it is possible you also had a seizure (which you have 
had in the past).

Please follow up with your doctors as below.

Please review your medication list closely.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient presented to the emergency department and was 
evaluated by the orthopedic surgery team. The patient was found 
to have a right hip periprosthetic femur fracture and was 
admitted to the orthopedic surgery service. The patient was seen 
by Medicine preoperatively for assessment. Given that he was 
asymptomatic, without angina, shortness of breath and physical 
exam findings of volume overload, they felt it was unlikely that 
obtaining further cardiac testing would change management and 
recommended proceeding with surgery. 

The patient was taken to the operating room on ___ for 
ORIF right hip periprosthetic femur fracture which the patient 
tolerated well (for full details please see the separately 
dictated operative report). The patient was taken from the OR to 
the PACU in stable condition and after recovery from anesthesia 
was transferred to the floor. The patient was initially given IV 
fluids and IV pain medications, and progressed to a regular diet 
and oral medications by POD#1. Speech and swallow was consulted 
given a history of aspiration and recommended ground solids with 
nectar thick liquids for his diet. 

The patient was given perioperative antibiotics and Lovenox 
anticoagulation per routine. The patient was transfused 4u PRBCs 
for acute blood loss anemia and Hct was 27.6 on the day of 
discharge - it should be checked for two more days and 
transfused for Hct <26.0. The patients home medications were 
continued throughout this hospitalization. The patient worked 
with ___ who determined that discharge to rehab was appropriate. 
The ___ hospital course was otherwise unremarkable.

At the time of discharge the patient was afebrile with stable 
vital signs that were within normal limits, pain was well 
controlled with oral medications, incisions were 
clean/dry/intact, and the patient had a Foley catheter in place 
which should be removed at rehab. The patient is touch down 
weight bearing in the right lower extremity, and will be 
discharged on Lovenox for DVT prophylaxis. The patient will 
follow up in two weeks per routine. A thorough discussion was 
had with the patient regarding the diagnosis and expected 
post-discharge course, and all questions were answered prior to 
discharge.
