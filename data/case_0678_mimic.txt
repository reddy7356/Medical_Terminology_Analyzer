Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ is a ___ year old woman with metastatic lung cancer 
(brain and bone) on osimertinib presents from clinic with 
persistent nausea/vomiting and found to have progressive 
hydrocephalus and slight increase in size of cerebellar lesion. 

#NAUSEA/VOMITING
#SECONDARY MALIGNANCY OF BRAIN (CEREBELLUM)
#HYDROCEPHALUS:
An MRI on the day of admission showed a small increase in size 
of her known cerebellar lesion as well as increasing 
hydrocephalus and periventricular edema. Her WBC was normal and 
she was afebrile and hemodynamically stable. A lumbar puncture 
was performed, which showed no evidence of infection. CSF was 
sent for cytology, which is still pending at the time of 
discharge. She was evaluated by radiation oncology, who did not 
feel that her symptoms were likely to be due to her cerebellar 
lesion and felt there was no indication for radiation therapy. 
She was also evaluated by neuro-oncology, who were similarly 
doubtful that her symptoms were due to her MRI findings. She was 
treated with Zofran, Compazine and started on 5 days of 4mg PO 
dexamethasone. She continued to experience mild nausea, relieved 
by Zofran and dexamethasone. She was evaluated by physical 
therapy, who felt she may have some vestibular dysfuntion, and 
recommended outpatient ___ rehab. She had no further 
episodes of lightheadedness during her admission, which ha 
previously been occurring ___ times per day. She was discharged 
with 3 additional days of dexamethasone 4mg daily (5 days 
total).

#LUNG CANCER:
Currently being treated with osimertinib. This was held during 
the first two days of her admission, then restarted.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES
=======================
[] will continue dexamethasone 4mg daily for 3 days
[] will need ___ rehab as outpatient
[] CSF cytology pending upon discharge, will need to be followed 
up by outpatient oncologist
[] Would continue to monitor EKGs as outpatient while on 
antiemetics
[] A cystic structure is noted in the right adnexa measuring 8.0 
x 8.1 x 7.0 
cm containing an eccentrically located hyperechoic structure 
without internal 
vascularity, incompletely evaluated. While a similar structure 
has been seen 
on multiple prior PET-CTs, the appearance on today's study 
differs from prior 
ultrasound and MR. ___ cannot be excluded in the setting 
of known lung 
cancer. Contrast enhanced pelvic MR is recommended for further 
evaluation.

Discharge Instructions:
Ms. ___,

It was a pleasure taking care of you at ___!

You were admitted to the hospital with nausea, vomiting and 
lightheadedness. An MRI of your brain demonstrated a slight 
increase in the size of your known cerebellar lesion as well as 
an increased amount of cerebral spinal fluid. A lumbar puncture 
did not reveal any sign of infection. Testing of the cerebral 
spinal fluid for evidence of cancer is still pending. You were 
evaluated by the Radiation Oncology team, who did not feel there 
was any indication for radiation to of your brain. You were 
given anti-nausea medication and steroids to treat your 
symptoms. You should continue to take the steroid medication 
(dexamethasone) for 3 additional days after discharge. You were 
evaluated by physical therapy, who felt you would benefit from 
___ rehab.

When you leave, it is important to take your medications as 
prescribed. It is also important you attend your appointments as

hydrocephalus, periventricular edema, and increasing metastases. 


In the past, ___ performed an LP that did not improve 
symptoms, so therapeutic LP was not pursued. Mrs ___ was very 
clear that she did not want aggressive interventions or 
diagnostic testing. She only wanted to receive treatments that 
had a good chance of symptom management without significant side 
effects. 

Radiation oncology was consulted and she received WBRT x 5 
treatments while admitted. She was started on high dose 
dexamethasone 4 q6, which continued through her radiation 
treatments and taper to 4 q8 on discharge. She will also start 
on temozolamide after discharge for consolidation therapy after 
RT and hope for additional symptom management. 

In regard to her systemic therapy, her osimertinib was 
discontinued by her primary team. She was seen prior to 
discharge and she will follow up with Dr ___ next week.

___ be discharged with home ___ services with outpatient 
palliative care. She is not ready to transition to home hospice 
at this time, but was aware that she was nearing the end of 
life. She was aware she has the option to call her ___ company 
to transition to hospice services with them when this is 
appropriate.

[ ] Temozolamide to begin ___
[ ] Follow up with Dr ___ 3 days after discharge
[ ] Further dexamethasone taper and temozolamide plan to be 
determined per Dr ___
[ ] Follow up with outpatient oncology team

# Cancer related fatigue
She had significant fatigue attributed to her leptomeningeal and 
metastatic disease. Ritalin was trialed, but after 1 dose, ___ 
felt confused and not herself, so it was discontinued.

# Shingles

IMAGING/STUDIES:
=============
___ CXR
FINDINGS: 
When compared to prior chest x-ray from ___, there has been 
interval
progression of the right-sided pleural effusion which is 
partially loculated
including some fluid within the fissure.  Underlying 
consolidation in the
right lung base is noted as well as opacity in the right 
paramediastinal
region as previously noted.  Of note there is no drastic 
interval change since
recent PET-CT however direct comparison is limited due to 
differences in
technique/positioning.  The left lung is grossly clear.  No 
acute osseous
abnormalities.
 
IMPRESSION: 
Appearance of the right pleural effusion, partially loculated 
pleural effusion
has grown since ___.  Underlying consolidation in the 
right lung
better assessed on prior PET-CT

___ CTA CHEST
FINDINGS: 
The aorta and its major branch vessels are patent, with no 
evidence of
stenosis, occlusion, dissection, or aneurysmal formation.  
Thoracic aorta is
normal in caliber without evidence of dissection, intramural 
hematoma nor
aneurysm.
 
The pulmonary arteries are well opacified to the subsegmental 
level, with no
evidence of filling defect to suggest pulmonary embolism.  The 
main and right
pulmonary arteries are normal in caliber.
 
There is no supraclavicular, axillary, mediastinal, or hilar 
lymphadenopathy. 
The visualized portion of the thyroid appears unremarkable.
 
Again seen is a large loculated right-sided pleural effusion 
that is increased
in size from PET CT on ___.  There is an associated 
leftward shift of
the mediastinum, slightly increased from prior.  Hyperdensities 
within the
effusion inferiorly is compatible with prior talc pleurodesis.  
There is no
evidence of pericardial effusion.
 
Again seen is a right upper lobe masslike consolidation abutting 
the
mediastinum measuring 3.7 x 1.6 cm (previously 2.1 x 3 cm).  
This mass appears
perhaps slightly larger, particularly at its medial aspect.  
Bilateral diffuse
micronodules are again seen and unchanged compared to ___,
although are markedly less conspicuous compared to ___.  Right
middle and lower lobe atelectasis are again noted.  The airways 
are patent to
the subsegmental level.
 
Limited images of the upper abdomen show relatively unchanged 
hypodensities in
the liver, which likely represent cysts.  Hyperenhancing focus 
in segment four
(2:91) is unchanged compared to ___, potentially 
altered perfusion
versus flash filling hemangioma though incompletely 
characterized.
 
Blastic lesion is unchanged at the superior endplate of T10, 
which did not
show FDG avidity on recent PET scan.
 
IMPRESSION:
1. No pulmonary embolism or acute aortic syndrome.
2. Increased loculated right pleural effusion with slight 
increased leftward
shift of the mediastinum compared to PET-CT on ___.
3. Right upper lobe soft tissue mass, which is relatively 
unchanged since ___.  Of note, on recent PET from ___ there is 
no increased
FDG uptake though continued followup will be necessary.
4. Diffuse bilateral micronodules are unchanged compared to ___,
although are markedly less conspicuous compared to ___.
5. Unchanged hypodensities in the liver, likely representing 
cysts. 
Hyperenhancing focus, unchanged, incompletely characterized 
though potentially
flash filling hemangioma or altered perfusion.
6. Unchanged blastic lesion of the superior endplate of T10, 
which did not
show FDG avidity on recent PET scan.

___ CT CHEST W/O CONTRAST
1. Significant interval improvement in the previously seen large 
loculated
right pleural effusion following pleural catheter placement, 
with small
residual.  Improved right basilar atelectasis, with mild 
re-expansion edema in
the right lung..
2. A right upper lobe mass.
3. Diffuse bilateral micronodules are more prominent compared to 
___,
have random distribution, arguing for component of infection, 
possibly
disseminated.  Component of diffuse metastatic disease or 
lymphangitic tumor
spread should be excluded on a follow-up chest CT.
4. T10 sclerosis is stable, likely metastasis.
RECOMMENDATION(S):  Follow-up chest CT.

___ Imaging CHEST (PORTABLE AP) 
Mild cardiomegaly is stable.  There are low lung volumes.  Small 
to moderate 
right effusion has increased despite the presence of a right 
pleural catheter. 
There is no pneumothorax.  Small lung nodules were better 
evaluated on prior 
CT. 

___ Imaging CHEST (PORTABLE AP) 
In comparison with the study of ___, there probably is 
slightly more 
prominence of the opacification in the right hemithorax 
consistent with 
substantial effusion and underlying atelectatic changes.  The 
pigtail catheter 
remains in place and there is no pneumothorax.  The spiculated 
mass in the 
right upper lung was better seen on the CT study of ___, as 
were the 
bilateral micro nodules..  In the appropriate clinical setting, 
it would be 
difficult to exclude superimposed pneumonia. 
The left lung appears essentially clear. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. ___ is ___ year old female with PMHx Stage IV NSCLC on 
Gefitinib since ___ complicated by right malignant pleural 
effusion s/p thoracenteses and pleurodesis x 2, most recently in 
___ who presents with progressive dyspnea on exertion and a 
dry cough for x 1 week found to have a R sided malignant pleural 
effusion. 

# Loculated right-sided malignant pleural effusion
