Imaging
___ CT chest w/o contrast
1. Markedly distended esophagus along its entire course, 
containing ingested material and secretions.  Apparent wall 
thickening of the proximal stomach, although this may be 
exaggerated by luminal under distension.  Recommend correlation 
with results from recent EGD. 
2. Scattered peribronchiolar opacities, consistent with 
multifocal infection.  However, consolidation in the right upper 
lobe is more nodular in appearance and follow-up CT is 
recommended in 3 months to exclude underlying malignancy. 
3. Other additional scattered pulmonary nodules measuring up to 
5 mm, could also be reassessed at the time of the next 
follow-up. 
4. Severe coronary artery calcifications.  Mild aortic valvular 
calcifications. 
5. Probable pulmonary arterial hypertension. 
RECOMMENDATION(S): 
1. Correlation with EGD results. 
2. Chest CT in 3 months. 

___ KUB
1.  No evidence of free intraperitoneal air.  The nasogastric 
tube tip is not detected, as it courses out of view.  Consider 
withdrawing several cm and repeating a film for confirmation. 
2.  Right lung opacities correlate with findings of multifocal 
infection on the earlier CT chest. 

___ CXR
The ETT has been removed.  The NG tube courses out of sight 
inferiorly.  
Airspace opacification in the right mid lung since suggesting 
aspiration/pneumonia. 

EGD ___
The esophagus was circumferentially coated in food material
consistent with known ingestion of scrambled eggs. The eggs were
non-obstructing and the lower esophageal sphincter was open. The
scope was passed into the stomach without difficulty. Using the
scope and water, the majority of the eggs were pushed into the
stomach. Poor motility was noted throughout the entire 
esophagus,
but water and eggs were seen to eventually progress to the
stomach.  
Clear fluid was seen in the stomach body and fundus. 
A single non-bleeding angioectasia was noted in the antrum. 
Normal duodenum.

Brief Hospital Course:
Summary
___ female past medical history significant for 
___ disease, restless leg syndrome, spinal stenosis, 
hypertension, hyperlipidemia, left bundle branch block presented 
to the ED with concerns of a fall overnight and was found to 
have a food impaction.

Acute issues
1. Food impaction: On EGD, patient did not have signs of 
peristalsis. Food was coating the esophagus but not obstructing 
the lumen which explains why patient was able to tolerate 
secretions. Differential for aperistalsis is broad, but 
achalasia ruled out with normal LES. ___ could be 
contributing vs. infiltrative disease vs. malignancy. Speech and 
swallow found no evidence of oropharyngeal aspiration risk and 
she was started on a full liquid diet. She was advised to 
continue on a liquid diet pending GI motility study on ___. 
Initially started on tube feeds via NGT per nutrition/GI recs 
given concern for inability to obtain adequate nutrition with 
liquid diet, but DC'ed given GOC. Discharged with plan for 
liquid diet until GI motility study to determine prognosis, then 
determination if patient will be allowed to eat for comfort 
knowing aspiration risk. Made DNR/DNI/DNH during this admission 
after discussion with patient and daughter in accordance with 
her wishes. 

2. Aspiration pneumonia: Patient has evidence of aspiration 
pneumonia on CT-chest though does not have symptoms. She was 
started on Ceftriaxone IV and switched to Augmentin PO for a 7 
day course that finished ___.

3. Fall. Likely mechanical especially given patient's history of 
___. 
 

Chronic issues:
___ disease: continued carbidopa-levodopa 50-200 1 tab 
po 5x/day, held home gabapentin in setting of delirium 
#hx TIA: continued home clopidogrel  
#Restless legs syndrome: continued home ropinirole (despite 
delirium risk, patient is very symptomatic)  
#Anxiety/insomnia: held home lorazepam in setting of delirium. 
Continued home sertraline at night  
#GERD: continued omeprazole 20 mg PO daily  
#HTN: continued amlodipine 5 mg daily  

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: 
====================
- outpatient motility study with GI ___
- liquid diet pending motility study
- lorazepam and gabapentin held at discharge given in hospital 
delirium, restart as needed
- radiology: CT edits: multifocal asp? PNA, gastric wall 
thickenening, could be due to underdistension, distal esophagus 
could have achalasia/tumor not seen, has nodular opacities RUL 
c/f ? malignancy, recommend 3 month follow up for interval 
monitoring

your lungs which we treated with antibiotics.

We would like you to have another test after you leave to see 
how food is moving into your stomach. For now, you should not 
eat any solid food. You can drink liquids and have soups and 
other liquid food.

After you leave, please continue taking your medications as 
prescribed.

Sincerely,
Your ___ team
