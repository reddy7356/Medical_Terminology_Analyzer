Attending: ___.
 
Chief Complaint:
CP/SOB
 
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubation/extubation (___)
 
History of Present Illness:
___ with hx of recurrent syncope s/p ppm, pSVT, hypothyroidism, 
HL p/w CP/SOB which awoke her from sleep, found to have new 
onset pulmonary edema and respiratory failure requiring 
intubation. 
.
Per the pt's daughter and husband, she was in her usual state of 
health until last night when she reported feeling warm and 
faint(which are symptoms that usually precede a syncopal event). 
This morning). She ate hot dogs and beans for dinner, and ate 
her usual ice cream. This am the pt woke up, drank coffee and 
ate part of a muffin, and then wandered outside. She was found 
by her husband to be complaining of chest pain, which escalated 
to the point that she was screaming for help. She also had SOB. 
.
Per the EMS run report, they found the pt to have BP 240/140 HR 
140 RR 40 O2 sat 75%RA. At the time she was A&Ox3, though in 
severe resp distress, with elevated jvd and accessory muscle 
use. No peripheral edema. The pt had an ekg (sinus tach w/pac 
and multifocal pvc, no st changes) and was given ntg 0.8mg sl 
spray x 3. She was started on cpap 10mm h20 w/slight improvement 
in o2 sat and resp effort.
.
On arrival to ___ ED the pt had VS HR 68 BP 185/110 RR 34 97% 
on cpap and on exam had rales ___ way up her lung fields. The pt 
was found alert at first, but mental status began to decline. 
She was changed from CPAP to bipap, however pt wasn't responding 
to commands consistently and then became unresponsive to 
commands. She was intubated with 20 etom/100 sux, and continued 
on fent/versed gtts for sedation. 
.
CXR showed ETT in place, though could be pulled back 1-2cm, and 
moderate pulm edema with R hilar fullness. Due to initial 
concern for pna, the pt was given a dose of 
vanc/cefepime/levoflox. She was also given PR ASA and 20mg lasix 
IV. Of note, pt had initial. EKG w/ LVH and lateral TWI (v4-v6). 
The pt triggered around 750am ___ mins after intubation) for 
hypotension to the ___ and repeat EKG showed some elevations 
in V2 and V3. During episode of hypotension, pt was given 1L NS 
IV. She again dropped her Bps to the ___ when bolused with 
midaz.  
.
Labs significant for initial trop <0.01 MB 2, BNP 1388, ABG 
7.22/
53/198/23 after which RR was increased to 22. WBC 11.2. VS at 
time of transfer 86/42, HR 70. 
.
On arrival to the ICU, the pt was sedated, vent was changed to 
cpap with RR around 14. HR ___, sBPs 120s-130s. 
.
The pt's husband and ___ deny recent URI, dyspnea, CP, or 
___ edema. 
.
Of note, per the pt's daughter, she has had episodes of labile 
blood pressure in the past, with BPs as high 200s (sometimes 
precipitated by paradoxic reactions to morphine, sometimes 
without explanation). She also notes that the pt has had 
syncopal episodes and episodes of staring off for ___ for which 
she has been seen by cardiology and neurology. A ppm was placed 
in ___ to help combat an "arrhythmia" and since then she has 
only had fewer episodes, last in ___. She denies any recent 
changes in medications or ppm settings. Note from ___ states 
prior TTEs have been normal. 
.
On review of systems, no prior history of stroke, TIA, deep 
venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of 
surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools 
or red stools. No denies recent fevers, chills or rigors. No 
exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the other review of 
systems were negative.
.  
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of dyspnea on 
exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema, 
palpitations.

REPORTS
Portable TTE (Complete) Done ___ at 9:30:00 AM      FINAL 
.
The left atrium is mildly dilated. No atrial septal defect is 
seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is mild symmetric left 
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is 
normal. There is moderate global left ventricular hypokinesis 
(LVEF = 30 %) with basal to mid LV hypokinesis - the LV apex has 
more preserved systolic function (more c/w non-ischemic CM). No 
masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. There is no 
ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size is 
normal with borderline normal free wall function. The ascending 
aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are 
mildly thickened. There is no aortic valve stenosis. Trace 
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are 
mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild to 
moderate (___) mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid 
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. The pulmonary artery 
systolic pressure could not be determined. There is no 
pericardial effusion.  
.
___   Imaging CHEST (PORTABLE AP) 
.
FINDINGS and IMPRESSION: There are diffuse interstitial 
opacities seen within both lungs, consistent with moderate 
pulmonary edema.  Increased consolidation behind the left heart 
may reflect atelectasis but repeat imaging after diuresis is 
recommended.   There is no definite pleural effusion.  There is 
no pneumothorax.  The heart is mildly enlarged.  Prominence of 
the right hilus may reflect underlying lymphadenopathy but this 
is impossible to discern given the extensive edema. 
 . 
Endotracheal tube is 2.4 cm above the carina with the neck in 
neutral 
position.  This could be withdrawn by 1-2 cm to prevent 
intermittent right 
mainstem intubation with neck flexion.  An enteric tube courses 
along the 
esophagus and enters the stomach, heading superiorly, presumably 
within a 
hiatal hernia.   
 . 
A right ventricular lead, from a left side dual lead pacer, 
takes an unusual course but is likely within the coronary sinus. 
 Dense calcfications project over the left heart and are thought 
to reflect a combination of both aortic and aortic valve 
calcifications, raising concern for aortic stenosis. Splenic 
calcifications are present. 
.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of ___ 7:10 AM 
.
There is substantial interval improvement in pulmonary edema, 
resolved except for the lung bases.  The patient was extubated 
with removal of the NG tube.  Heart size and mediastinum are 
currently stable with the left mediastinal shift which might be 
in part related to left lower lobe atelectasis.  No pneumothorax 
is seen. 
.
___   Cardiovascular ECHO   ___ 
.
Conclusions  
The left atrium is mildly dilated. LV systolic function appears 
globally depressed (ejection fraction 30 percent), with regional 
variation. The interventricular septum appears more hypokinetic 
than the rest of the left ventricle. Right ventricular chamber 
size and free wall motion are normal. The ascending aorta is 
mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly 
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. The mitral valve 
leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate (2+) mitral 
regurgitation is seen. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is 
seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity of tricuspid 
regurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated.] There is 
mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no 
pericardial effusion. 
.
___   Imaging CHEST (PA & LAT) 
.
IMPRESSION: 
 . 
1. Interval improvement in bibasilar opacities.  No new opacity 
identified.  No CHF. 
2. COPD and moderately severe cardiomegaly.   
3. Borderline aneurysmal dilatation of the upper abdominal 
aorta. 
 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ with hx of recurrent syncope s/p ppm, pSVT, hypothyroidism, 
HL p/w CP/SOB which awoke her from sleep, found to have new 
onset pulmonary edema and respiratory failure requiring 
intubation. 
. 
ACUTE ISSUES
# CP/Respiratory failure: 
Patient presented with report of substernal chest pain and SOB, 
found to be hypoxic and hypertensive with rales on exam. 
Untimately required intubation. CXR appeared consistent with 
moderate pulmonary edema. No documented CHF, not on home 
diuretics, however does have hx of hyperlipidemia. New onset 
pulm edema in setting of CP and HTN concerning for precipitating 
ischemic event vs hypertensive emergency. Negative cardiac 
enzymes, transient lateral STE resolving in ICU, and TTE with 
new depression in EF to 30%, but without evidence of ischemic 
changes. A repeat ECHO showed persistent reduced EF, but per 
discussion with family, patient would not like diagnositic 
cardiac cath, thus patient was medically optimized. She was 
continued on carvedilol and started on lisinopril and 
furosemide. 
.
# Global hypokinesis, EF 30%: 
Patient with presumed new decreased EF to 30%, without ischemic 
distribution. History not c/w prior CHF (no ___ edema, DOE, 
orthopnea). Presumed secondary to hypertension emergency with 
cardiac stunning. CE remained negative, EKG remained without 
acute changes suggestive of ischemia.  Repeat ECHO showed EF 
persistently depressed, will start basic CHF meds  
.
# Hypotension/Hypertension: 
Patient with history of labile BPs at baseline, not on home 
antihypertensives. Was initially very hypertensive and then 
dropped BPs in setting of intubation and sedation. Stable at 
discharge on carvedilol and lisinopril.
.  
CHRONIC ISSUES
# Recurrent syncopal episodes s/p ppm: 
Has had extensive workup and etiology is not totally clear, 
however believed to be cardiac source, improved with pacemaker 
placement. Transient episode of AVP, PSVT, as per EP pacer 
working appropriately.  
.
# Hyperglycemia: 
Initial serum glucose 275 without known history of DM. Patient 
was covered with sliding-scale insulin, but her glucoses 
normalized by discharge. 
.
# HL: 
Continued pravastatin.
.
# Osteoporosis with hx of multiple fractures: 
Continued calcium + vitD.
.
# Depression: 
Continued mirtazepine, paroxetine.
. 
# GERD: 
Continued omeprazole.
.
# Hypothyroidism: 
Continued levothyroxine.
.
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
#Patient should have follow-up with PCP and primary cardiologist 
within ___ business days to evaluate medication regimen.
.
#Patient found to have borderline aneurysmal dilatation (2.9cm) 
of the upper abdominal aorta. This should be followed per 
recommendations.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear ___, 
.
It was a pleasure participating in your care. You were admitted 
because you developed chest pain and shortness of breath. You 
were found to have some fluid in your lungs and decreased 
functioning of your heart, and required intubation briefly to 
help with your briefly. The cause of this episode is not clear, 
but may be due to your high blood pressure or narrowing of your 
blood vessels in your heart. We have started some new 
medications to control your blood pressure and to help get rid 
of the fluid in your lungs. You will need to follow up with your 
primary care doctor and your cardiologist for further management 
of these medications as they may need to be titrated over time. 
 
Followup Instructions:
___
