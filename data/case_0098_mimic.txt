History of Present Illness:
This is a ___ with a past medical history significant 
for T2DM complicated by neuropathy, nephropathy, ESRD on HD 
___, neuropathy and diabetic wounds s/p multiple amputations 
who presented from ___ for worsening plantar 
heel ulceration. The patient reported that he was unsure how 
long this wound had been present, but reported that it had been 
a long time-- upwards of years. The patient did report that he 
has noticed an increase in the amount of drainage and 
foul-smelling
odor from the wound recently. He was seen was an outpatient in 
the ___ clinic on ___ and the ulcer was excisionally 
debrided of necrotic and nonviable tissue down to and including 
the level of the deep fascia. He was subsequently referred to 
the
___ ED due to concern for deep tissue infection and IV 
antibiotics. 

Upon arrival to the ED at ___, the patient was afebrile and 
his vitals were stable and within normal limits. He was resting 
comfortably and in no pain. He had labs done which were within 
normal limits with the exception of a Cr of 4.0, HgB 11.1, and 
INR 1.4. He had a foot XR showing loss of cortical detail at the 
distal aspect of the cuboid, potentially concerning for 
osteomyelitis as well as significant deformity of the hindfoot 
appears grossly unchanged with large heel soft tissue defect. 
The patient was started on Linezolid and Ceftazidime. Wound 
aerobic/anaerobic cult & gram stain were sent as well as Blood
cultures. 

Podiatry was consulted and evaluated the patient and felt the R 
plantar foot wound was grossly infected w/ significant fibrotic/ 
necrotic tissue with deep probing to calcaneus, and surrounding 
erythema. Podiatry performed a deep swab for culture. Their team 
recommended admission to medicine for IV abx and felt he would 
benefit from a debridement in the OR but before vascular 
optimization as he is a known vasculopath w/ hx of L AKA and 
multiple other amputations. Vascular Surgery was also consulted
and recommended admission to medicine for antibiotics and 
podiatry intervention as well as non-invasives. 
 
Upon arrival to the floor, the patient reports that he is still 
experiencing some soreness of his right foot, but otherwise 
feels well. He is upset that it took him so long to get a room 
on the medical floor. He would like to eat. He denies fevers, 
chills, chest pain, shortness of breath, leg/stump pain. 
Otherwise, the patient endorses the above history.

FLOW CYTOMETRY IMMUNOPHENOTYPING ___
The following tests (antibodies) were performed: Kappa, Lambda, 
and CD antigens 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 10, 11c, 19, 20, 23, 34, 38, 
45, and 56.

RESULTS:
10-color analysis with CD45 vs. side-scatter gating is used to 
evaluate for lymphoma.
Approximately 70.1% of total acquired events are evaluable 
non-debris events.
The viability of the analyzed non-debris events, done by 7-AAD 
is 98.5%.
CD45-bright, low side-scatter gated lymphocytes comprise 81.9% 
of total analyzed events.
B cells comprise 22.4% of lymphoid-gated events.
B cells demonstrate monoclonal kappa light chain restriction. 
They co-express pan-B cell markers CD19 and CD20. They do not 
express any other characteristic antigens including CD5, CD10, 
CD11c, CD23, CD34 and CD38.
T cells comprise 66.6% of lymphoid gated events and express 
mature lineage antigens (CD3, CD5, CD2, and CD7).
Non-specific loss of CD7 is seen in a minor subset of cells.
T cells have a CD4:CD8 ratio of 2.8.
CD56 positive, CD3 negative natural killer cells represent 7.5% 
of gated lymphocytes. They co-express CD2, CD7 and CD8 (subset).
A discrete plasma cell population is not identified.

INTERPRETATION
Immunophenotypic findings consistent with involvement by a CD5 
negative/CD10 negative and kappa restricted B-cell lymphoma. 
Correlation with clinical and other ancillary findings is 
recommended. A biopsy of a pathologically enlarged lymph node or 
submission of another sample for cytogenetics work-up could be 
considered. Flow cytometry immunophenotyping may not detect all 
abnormal populations due to topography, sampling or artifacts of 
sample preparation.

Brief Hospital Course:
PATIENT SUMMARY
==================
___ man with a past medical history significant for T2DM 
complicated by neuropathy, nephropathy, ESRD on HD ___, and 
diabetic wounds s/p multiple amputations who presented from ___ 
___ for worsening plantar heel ulceration with 
concern for soft tissue infection and osteomyelitis. As detailed 
below, he underwent debridement by podiatry, lower extremity 
angioplasty by vascular surgery, and was transitioned to oral 
Augmentin with some evidence of wound healing prior to 
discharge. On preoperative imaging for vascular surgery he was 
incidentally found to have a pleural effusion which tested 
positive for B-cell lymphoma on cytology, bone marrow biopsy 
confirming lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma. He remained stable and 
was discharged on Augmentin with plan for outpatient PET-CT, 
possible lung biopsy, and oncology followup. 

ACUTE/ACTIVE PROBLEMS: 
=============================
# Right Foot Soft Tissue Infection/Osteomyelitis 
Patient presented from his outpatient podiatrist with concerns 
for a deep soft tissue infection & osteomyelitis of his right 
foot. The ulcer was excisionally debrided of necrotic and 
nonviable tissue down to and including the level of the deep 
fascia on ___ by his primary podiatrist prior to 
presentation to the ED. Upon arrival to the ED, the patient was 
stared on antibiotics with Linezolid and Ceftazidime given his 
other antibiotic allergies. Upon further questioning, patient's 
documented allergy to vancomycin was an irritation when given 
through peripheral IV. He did not have any rash, throat closing, 
tongue swelling, or difficulty breathing. Given this, vancomycin 
was administered with HD, and linezolid discontinued, with 
addition of metronidazole for anaerobic coverage pending culture 
results.

He went back to the OR with podiatry on ___ for additional 
debridement, which revealed no pus, but not much bleeding. More 
cultures were sent, and wound vac was not placed. He had 
angioplasty of the external iliac ___ with vascular surgery, 
however no stents were placed due to patient's inability to 
tolerate the procedure due to itchiness. 

Micro during this admission notable for beta strep/bacteroides 
(swab ___ and MSSA (tissue ___. Unfortunately, Mr. ___ 
had GI upset when taking Flagyl by mouth. Due to his listed 
allergies, this limited his choice and antibiotics. Although 
ertapenem daily would have been an option, this would have 
required PICC placement, and the patient already with a left 
upper extremity fistula. He was not amenable to this idea. Upon 
further questioning, the patient's allergy to penicillin was 
deemed questionable, and so he underwent graded challenge with 
ampicillin, and successfully received augmentin. He is to 
continue these antibiotics for 6 weeks but ID will follow up 
with him as an outpatient. 

# Peripheral Vascular Disease 
The patient has a history of peripheral vascular disease which 
is likely contributing to the above ulcer/infection. Vascular 
surgery was consulted in the ED and recommended non-invasive 
imaging, IV antibiotics, and podiatry intervention. Of note, 
angiogram in ___ showed moderate iliac, femoropopliteal and 
tibial arterial occlusion. He was recommended for angiography 
with intervention which the patient declined and left AMA prior 
to any intervention being done. At that time he was started on 
an ASA, statin, however he does not take these as an outpatient 
due to his perception that they hurt him. 

He is status post angioplasty of the external iliac artery on 
___. Unfortunately the patient did not tolerate the whole 
procedure, so further angioplasty could not be performed. Stents 
were not placed, given the patient's nonadherence to 
medications, and his inability to tolerate the procedure. A week 
into his hospitalization, he began to be compliant with his 
aspirin and statin. 

# Lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma
CT abdomen and pelvis obtained for planning of vascular 
procedure on ___ showed right pleural effusion with 
thickening, inflammatory stranding in the upper abdominal 
mesentery, and surrounding pancreatic head, markedly enhancing 
left renal lower pole mass, and extensive lymphadenopathy 
involving abdomen and pelvis, as well as lytic lesions in bony 
pelvis. CT chest was then obtained to examine for metastases. It 
showed diffuse lymphadenopathy, pleural thickening and pleural 
effusion, which was tapped by thoracentesis by ___ on ___, 
followed by chest tube placement by IP on ___ with 
para-aortic lymph node biopsy by ___ ___. Flow cytometry of 
pleural fluid revealed B cell lymphoma; para-aortic LN biopsy 
was, however, normal on pathologic examination. He was 
transferred to the heme-onc service where he underwent bone 
marrow biopsy, revealing lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma. Plan for 
outpatient PET-CT for staging purposes, then potential 
transbronchial lung mass/node biopsy by IP depending on what PET 
shows (because would need to assess for transformation to high 
grade lymphoma). Did not start any treatment this 
hospitalization. Has scheduled ___ clinic appointment next 
___ with Dr. ___ at ___.

# Encephalopathy
Early on in admission Patient with subacute change in 
personality, was less argumentative, and with poor memory and 
hypersexual behavior. This was very far from his baseline per 
his family and not consistent with even prior hospitalizations. 
Although first noted after ___ guided lymph node biopsy, during 
which he received a total of 75 mcg fentanyl, per family and 
nursing he has had a change in personality over the last few 
days. Initial concern for lingering effects of fentanyl given 
stage renal disease, toxic metabolic encephalopathy, or 
difficulty with adjustment after finding out he has cancer. Head 
CT was performed on ___, which was negative for acute 
pathology. MRI ___ also negative for acute abnormality. His 
personality changes resolved spontaneously on ___, 
consistent with delirium.

#SOB/Diaphoresis: 
Patient with an episode of SOB/diaphoresis ___ of ___ in the 
setting of significant episode of nausea and emesis. With the 
extent of his vascular disease, he is highly likely to have at 
least some degree of CAD. His SOB/diaphoresis has not recurred, 
and his cardiac enzymes were stable. He refused ECG, and began 
to feel better stopping p.o. Flagyl.

# Medication Reconciliation
# Medication nonadherence
The patient presented with a list of medications and he was 
unsure which ones he was on or filling. His list included both 
an ACEi (Lisinopril) and ___ (Olmesartan) which were both 
held given unclear fill history and indication. The patient's 
med list also states he is on simvastatin-- it is unclear why he 
would not be on atorva or rosuva given severity of his vascular 
disease. Patient reports that he uses ___ in ___ on ___ 
Street, however when we called that ___, he only used it to fill 
antibiotics and calcium. Per patient, he does not take any other 
medications at home, because he distrusts that they are good for 
him. He has agreed to take the antibiotics, but greatly 
distrusts that other medications are good for him. 

CHRONIC ISSUES
=================
#ESRD on HD (MWF): 
He received dialysis while in-house per his regular schedule.

#Atrial Fibrillation: 
Patient has a CHADsVASc 5. He is not on anticoagulation at home 
(confirmed with pt.). Rates controlled on presentation, and 
patient refusing telemetry, so discontinued. He has refused 
anticoagulation in the past and is not interested in starting 
now. Sent home with metoprolol succinate for rate control. 

#Type II DM 
Hemoglobin A1c 5 on admission, and patient refusing 
fingersticks. 

#HTN
Although antihypertensives were on his medication list, patient 
denied taking any medications other than outpatient, and refused 
all antihypertensives while in house. 

# Hyperlipidemia
Patient is written for home statin, although has never filled 
the prescription. He was written for statin while in house, but 
continually refused. 

# Cirrhosis
# Hep C
Follows w/ ___ clinic as outpatient at ___. He was not 
on any medications for his cirrhosis prior to presentation. No 
signs of decompensation/ascites/or encephalopathy at this time. 
Baseline LFTs on admission were within normal limits. 

# Behavioral Issues
# Adjustment disorder
On previous admissions and at outpatient appointments, the 
patient intermittently declined labs and was frequently verbally 
abusive to staff. Psychiatry previously evaluated the patient 
and felt he met criteria for an adjustment disorder and a 
chronic neurocognitive disorder due to his medical 
comorbidities.

History of Present Illness:
Mr. ___ is a ___ yoM with CKD stage ___, DM, h/o right foot 
ulcers who presented today to the ___ ED for evaluation. Per 
the patient, he was seen recently here by his renal physician, 
who noted that his blood pressure was low (and also, per notes, 
that his Cr was elevated from baseline). He was advised to see 
his PCP, which he did today, and who referred him to the 
___. He notes that he has been feeling very well and has no 
specific complaints, including any trouble with his heel. He 
does report that two weeks ago, the patient had a bout of 
ongoing nausea/vomiting which lasted until recently.  
.  
At the ___ ED, the pt was found to have an elevated WBC 
count, ARF and was orthostatic with an SBP of 85 on standing. 
There was concern for an acute infection of his right heel. He 
was given IVF, then transferred to ___ where he is followed by 
podiatry. The podiatry service evaluted him in the ED and 
planned to take him to the OR for a heel intervention. On 
arrival in the OR, the pt was found to be in AF with RVR to the

change in BP. IV diltiazem was then utilized, with the pt coming 
under good HR control after 10 mg IV. He was given 30 mg 
diltiazame PO x 2, and then one addition 10 mg IV dose prior to 
transfer to the medical floor (MICU admission had initially been 
considered, however it was felt the patient was stable for floor 
managment).

foot presents with infected right heel, new AF with RVR, and 
acute on chronic renal failure.  
.  
1) Right heel osteomyelitis: In the setting of previously known 
right Charcot foot. Transferred from OSH ED to ___ for 
management of right heel ulcer and infection. Upon arrival to 
the OR, pt found to be in atrial fibrillation with rapid 
ventricular response. Procedure was aborted and admitted to 
medicine. Upon medical stabilization of atrial fibrillation and 
acute on chronic renal failure (see below), the patient went 
back to the OR on ___ for debridement of the R heel ulcer and 
implanatation of antibiotic coated beads. Wound cultures 
revealed GNRs, GPC, and Bacteriodes fragilis. Calcaneal tissue 
removed from the OR revealed acute osteomyelitis. Blood cultures 
were negative. He was then started on IV vancomycin and zosyn, 
renally dosed, and will need to complete a 6 week course of 
antibiotics. A PICC was placed. Given renal failure, vancomycin 
will need to be dosed by level for goal of ___. He was taken 
back to the OR on ___ by podiatry for another debridement. A 
dressing change was performed by podiatry the morning after and 
he was placed in a bivalve cast in slight plantar flexion 
position the following day. He will need daily dressing changes 
per page 1 recommendations by podiatry. He will f/u with his 
podiatrist, Dr. ___, as an outpatient.
.
2) Leukocytosis: Likely from heel infection. Blood cx no growth, 
urine culture revealed E. Coli sensitive to zosyn, and calcaneal 
tissue from the OR showed signs of acute osteomyelitis. He was 
treated with IV vancomycin and zosyn as above and will need to 
complete a 6 week course for osteomyelitis.
.
3) Atrial fibrillation: No previously known history of atrial 
fibrillation. Rate controlled with uptitration of metoprolol. 
TSH wnl and ruled out MI with 3 sets of negative CEs. TTE 
revealed dilated LA and RA. Given CHADS score of 4, he was 
started on anti-coagluation on ___ after surgical management of 
osteomyelitis as above. He was transferred to a LTAC for heparin 
drip bridge onto coumadin. He also remained on aggrenox. He was 
seen by his outpatient cardiologist Dr. ___ 
follow-up with as an outpatient for consideration of a 
cardioversion and possible initiation of amiodarone. Per Dr. 
___, LFTs and a TSH were checked and pending upon 
discharge.

4) Acute on chronic renal failure: Cr 5.3 on admission, peaked 
to 5.8, and was 5.5 at the time of discharge. He was seen by the 
renal consultants who initially thought the patient may have 
been pre-renal and have ATN, possibly from poor forward flow 
state from afib with RVR, as his urine sediment did reveal muddy 
brown casts. UA initially showed FeNa of 1.6, then progressed to 
3, then 7 during course of hospitalization. Renal U/S with 
dopplers showed no signs of renal artery stenosis, vein 
thrombosis, or hydronephrosis. UA showed sterile pyuria and 
culture with e.coli sensitive to zosyn, which pt was already 
receiving for osteomyelitis. Renal did not feel pt needed acute 
hemodialysis, but will likely need dialysis in the future. Outpt 
ACEI and ___ held. He was started on Al(OH)3 X 3 days for 
hyperphosphatemia and then transitioned onto sevelamer. He was 
also started on daily iron and may need epogen in the future. He 
is to follow-up with Dr. ___ as an outpatient.

5) Normocytic Anemia: No signs of blood loss.  Likely 
hemoconcentrated on admission. Renal disease also likely 
contributing to anemia. No transfusions were needed and the 
patient was started on iron supplementation as above. 
.  
6) AG Metabolic Acidosis: Likley from chronic renal failure. He 
was started on bicitra per renal recommendations.
.  
7) HTN: Had borderline BP in setting of infection, ARF and new 
AF. Held ACEi and ___ given renal failure. Also held amlodipine 
while metoprolol was being uptitrated. 
.  
8) EtOH abuse: Per pt, last drink several days prior to 
admisison, and thus withdrawal felt to be fairly unlikely. 
However, he was initially closely monitored on a CIWA scale with 
valium prn. There were no signs of alcohol withdrawal during 
hospitalization. He was started on a daily MVI, thiamine, and 
folate. Given h/o EtOH abuse and coumadinization, cardioversion 
was discussed as an option for the pt with his cardiologist as 
above. He will f/u with his cardiologist as an outpatient.
.  
9) DM2: HbgA1c from ___. Placed on HISS. 
.  
10) h/o CVA: Neuro exam stable. Continued home Aggrenox. ___ 
consider switching to EC aspirin given coumadin in future.

This is a ___ year old male with past medical history of 
diabetes type 2, severe peripheral vascular disease, diabetic 
kidney disease on  ESRD admitted ___ with severe 
infection of R foot, found to have acute osteomyelitis with 
concern for associated necrotizing fasciitis, status post R 
foot excisional debridement, with concern for underlying 
vascular disease, on day of discharge leaving against medical 
advice after declining additional antibiotics and vascular 
intervention, discharged home with plan for additional IV 
antibiotic course to be given at dialysis 

# R foot acute osteomyelitis with associated soft tissue 
infection
# Necrotizing fasciitis
Patient presented from dialysis with severe infection of R 
foot, found to have acute osteomyelitis with concern for 
associated necrotizing fascitis, status post R foot excisional 
debridement, with concern for underlying vascular disease.  He 
was started on broad spectrum antibiotics, 
dapto/aztreonam/clinda due to reported allergy to 
cephalosporins; per ID recommendations, patient underwent 
cefazolin challenge without allergy--he was switched to IV 
Cefazolin (to be given with HD) and PO Flagyl. Culture and bone 
biopsy results grew mixed bacterial flora, bacteroides, and 
MSSA. He clinically improved.  He was recommended for vascular 
management as below, but left against medical advice as below.  
He was evaluated by physical therapy and cleared for home. He 
was discharged with plan for Cefazolin to be administered at 
outpatient ___ facility through ___ and take po Flagyl 
at home through ___.  Wound vac to be managed by ___ with
