Ms. ___ is a ___ woman who presented with new

felt as if she had "a lumpy abdomen."  On physical examination, 
an abdominal irregularity was identified and this led to a CT 
scan of the abdomen and pelvis with contrast on ___.  The 
imaging study revealed a large complex cyst of the right adnexa 
measuring 13 x 23 x 26 cm.  The mass was notably 
well-circumscribed, ovoid, and complex in nature and extended 
into the upper abdomen. The limited evaluation of the uterus and 
the left adnexa was unremarkable and there was no other evidence 
of an irregularity that would make us concerned for the

laparotomy, bilateral salinpingo-oophorectomy, and resection of

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ was admitted to the gynecology oncology service 
after undergoing exploratory laparatomy, bilateral 
salpingo-oophorectomy, and resection of pelvic mass. Please see 
the operative report for full details.  

Her post-operative course is detailed as follows. Immediately 
postoperatively, she received a TAP block in the PACU. On the 
floor, her pain was controlled with Dilaudid PCA, IV toradol, 
and tylenol. 

On post-operative day 1, she experienced an episode of dizziness 
and low blood pressure, which was attributed to a vaso-vagal 
episode as she had a normal ECG, normal blood glucose, and 
negative orthostatics. Her diet was advanced without difficulty 
and she was transitioned to PO oxycodone, acetaminophen and 
motrin. Her urine output was adequate so her Foley catheter was 
removed and she voided spontaneously. 

On post-operative day 2, she remained hemodynamically stable and 
was tolerating a regular diet, voiding spontaneously, ambulating 
independently, and pain was controlled with oral medications. 
She was then discharged home in stable condition with outpatient 
follow-up scheduled.
