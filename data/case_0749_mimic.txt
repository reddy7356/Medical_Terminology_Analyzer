___ now two and a half months status post a deceased donor
renal transplant complicated by delayed graft function and
lymphocele status post attempted laparoscopic peritoneal window

0 ccs ___ without improvement despite stripping drain and
aspirating fibrinous plug from drain this morning.

Of note, renal biopsies on ___ and ___ consistent

Brief Hospital Course:
On ___, he underwent deceased donor renal transplant with a 
standard criteria donor. Surgeon was Dr. ___. Please 
refer to operative note for details. A double J ureteral stent 
was placed across the anastomosis and a 19 ___ drain in the 
retroperitoneum adjacent to the anastomoses. 

Postop, he was hypertensive in PACU and received IV metoprolol.  
He was oliguric. Creatinine remained in the 13 range. IV fluid 
was stopped. He was dialyzed for hyperkalemia and volume 
overload on postop day 1, 2 and 4 then 6 via an AVF. He was 
given Lasix without much response. Foley was removed on ___ 
without complications. Urine for protein/creatinine ratio was 
sent given h/o of FSGS. 

On ___, a unit of PRBC was given for a HCT of 20 with HCT 
increase to 24. Hct decreased to 20 again. Hemolysis labs were 
sent and were negative. Another unit of PRBC was transfused on 
___ with hct remaining in the ___ range. ATG was given in 
divided doses given lower plt count. 

A total of 4 doses of ATG were administered in divided doses due 
to lower platelet counts with last dose on ___. Cellcept was 
well tolerated at 1 gram bid. Steroids were tapered over 5 days 
to Prednisone 20mg given h/o FSGS.  Prograf was dosed per trough 
level with dose set at 7mg bid. Renal biopsy on ___ was negative 
for rejection. Findings were consistent with ATN (interstitial 
fibrosis). 

SBPs were elevated to 180s and Carvedilol was started and dose 
adjusted to 25mg bid with SBP decreasing. However, Amlodipine 
was added with improved control.  

Diet was advanced and tolerated.  Bowel function resumed with 
passage of BMs. Around hospital day 13, he had c/o of trouble 
swallowing and was evaluated by ENT who noted findings of 
reflux. Zantac as well as Omeprazole 40mg bid were started with 
improvement. He became independent with ambulation. Incision was 
intact with staples without redness/bleeding or drainage. JP 
drain output increased around postop day 7 as high as 1.5 
liters. JP creatinine was 16.8 same as serum creatinine. JP 
creatinine was repeated days later and was 9.2, again similar to 
serum creatinine. 

On ___, the JP drain was removed and insertion site was sutured. 
He developed abdominal distension and an U/S on ___ 
demonstrated a perinephric fluid collection (8.5cm x 6.3cm x 
3.8cm )as well as an anterior mid right abdominal collection 
measuring (12.3cm x 9.5cm x 3.1cm). On ___, he was taken to the 
OR by Dr. ___ for exploratory laparoscopy with plan 
for peritoneal window and renal biopsy for lymphocele. Upon 
entering the peritoneum, which was obviously thickened, 
approximately 200-300 cc of thin, bloody fluid was noted and 
drained ( sent for creatinine 9.2). Given anatomy, a peritoneal 
window was unable to be done and a JP drain was placed in the 
retroperitoneum. The kidney was also biopsied (pathology  
pending). Please refer to operative note for complete details 
(___)

Postop, he was stable. Pain was well controlled and the JP 
output was serosanguinous averaging 500cc/day. The plan was to 
leave the JP drain and place and have the patient empty/record 
and f/u in the outpatient Transplant clinic on ___ with Dr. 
___. Incision was intact with staples without 
redness/bleeding or drainage. 

He continued on HD on ___ schedule. Last HD was ___. Urine 
output averaged 275cc/day. 

Given h/o of HBcAb positive status, he was started on Lamivudine 
qd postop. 

At time of discharge, he was A&O, tolerating a renal diet and 
ambulating without assist. He was transferred back to ___ 
___. 

**of note, he c/o of dysuria on ___. UA and Urine culture were 
sent and will need f/u**
