History of Present Illness:
___ year old male, with h/o HTN, presents with dyspnea on 
exertion which began one week ago. Patient experienced dyspnea 
and dizziness ___ minutes while in the shower, ___ minutes 
following working out in the gym. He had recently started a new 
exercise regimen. Patient also noticed new onset dyspnea while 
climbing 2 flts of stairs at work. Endorses extreme fatigue 
while exercising, and an episode of L arm tingling, hand 
coolness, and occasional espisodes of mild chest pressure, not 
associated with exertion, and fleeting L-sided chest "twinges" 
which he has had for years. He also has had ___ episodes of 
palpitations over the past ___ years, which have lasted approx 2 
days and are associated with drinking wine and coffee, and large 
meals. He sought medical care for these episodes and was 
reassured they were benign. 

Patient went to his PCP yesterday, and was found to have new Q 
waves/nonspecific changes on EKG (compared to ___ EKG) and was 
sent to CHA. Trop at CHA were neg x1. CTA at CHA showed 4.2 cm 
dilated proximal aorta, and given family h/o fatal dissection at 
age ___, Pt was transferred here for further evaluation. 

In the ED, Pt was seen by Thoracic Surgery who felt that the 
pain was not due to the aneurysm. He was asymptomatic. He was 
placed into obs for a stress test, which showed ___epressions inferolaterally and >___lev in avR and V1.
 
Labs were notable for CBC: Hct 38.9 Chem 7: K 3.1 Cr 0.8; INR 
1.0; Trop 0.01 x2 
 
In the ED, initial vitals were Temp: 97.9 HR: 65 BP: 136/85

On arrival to the floor, Patient is has no complaints, other 
than occasional fleeting (lasting seconds) "twinges", in 
different areas of his chest, which he has had for years . 
Denies chest pressure, pain, palpitations, dyspnea, or other 
symptoms.

INTERPRETATION: This ___ year old man with recent diagnosis of a 
non-disecting ascending aorta measuring 4.2 cm was referred to 
the lab 
from the ER following negative serial markers for ischemia to 
evaluate 
atypical chest discomfort. The patient exercised for 7.7 minutes 
of a 
___ protocol and was stopped for ST segment changes and 
systolic BP 
approaching 180 mmHg in setting of aortic aneurysm. The 
estimated peak 
MET capacity was 9 which represents an average functional 
capacity for 
his age. No arm, neck, back or chest discomfort was reported by 
the 
patient throughout the study. At peak exercise, there was 1.5-2 
mm 
horizontal/downsloping STD in the inferolateral leads and 1 mm 
and 2 mm 
STE in V1 and avR, respectively. The STE resolved within 4 
minutes of 
recovery and the STD by minute 7 of recovery with rest. The 
rhythm was 
sinus with one apb and vpb with one atrial couplet. Appropriate 
hemodynamic response to exercise and recovery. 
IMPRESSION: Ischemic EKG changes in the absence of angina. 
Normal 
hemodynamic response to exercise. 
 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ year old male, with h/o HTN, presents with dyspnea on 
exertion which began one week ago, transferred from CHA after 
CTA showed 4.2 cm dilated aorta, and found to have ETT 
concerning for unstable angina.

# CAD: Patient presented with new onset dyspnea, and was 
evaluated for cardiac etiology. Patient had an abnormal ETT with 
___epressions inferolaterally and >___lev avR, V1. 
Troponins were negative. Cardiac catheterization showed mid-LAD, 
and diagonal with 70 and 80% occlusion, respectively. 
Drug-eluding stents were placed. Patient will have a followup 
PCI for an OM1 occlusion in approximately 2 weeks. Patient was 
started on Ticagrelor, Simvastatin, ASA, Metoprolol and he will 
continue his home lisinopril.  

# Vasovagal Events: Patient had two vasovagal events, 
characterized by diaphoresis, mild dyspnea, and lightheadedness. 
The first while having an IV placed in the ED and the second 
after having his cardiac catheterization. These two episodes 
resolved spontaneously. EKG done during the second event showed 
no significant changes and evaluation for cardiac etiology was 
negative.  

# HTN:Patietn was continued on his home lisinopril. He was 
started on Metoprolol 25mg qdaily. His home HCTZ was 
discontinued.
 
# Proximal aorta dilation: CTA at OSH shows 4.2 cm proximal 
aortic dilation. 
- Seen by Thoracic Surg: no intervention at this time

# Anemia: Hct 38.9. Possibly secondary to vegetarian diet. 
Consider further evaluation as an outpatient, including iron 
studies.
 

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
#Follow up Cardiology
#Follow up PCP
___ further work-up for anemia
#Proximal aortic dilation of 4.2 cm: no intervention at this 
time

Discharge Diagnosis:
Coronary Artery Disease ___ placement x2

 
Discharge Condition:
Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Level of Consciousness: Alert and interactive.
Activity Status: Ambulatory - Independent.

 
Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted to the hospital with shortness of breath. You 
had a cardiac stress test and cardiac catheterization  and were 
found to have coronary artery disease. You had two drug-eluding 
stents placed. You will  need to take a new medication, 
ticagrelor (which you will need to take for one year), aspirin, 
as well as your blood pressure medications. Your 
hydrochlorathiazide was discontinued, a new medication, 
metoprolol, was started, and should continue to take your home 
lisinopril. You also had two "vasovagal" events during your 
admission, which resolved. Please take your medications as 
prescribed and follow up at the medical appointments listed 
below.
