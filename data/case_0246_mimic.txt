Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ is a ___ w/ PMH HTN, DM2 (on insulin) presented with 
nausea/vomiting and lightheadedness most consistent with acute 
gastroenteritis vs gastroparesis.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES
=================
[] follow-up with PCP (at HCA) for nausea and lightheadedness 
once discharged from rehab
[] Her furosemide was held while in house. Ongoing consideration 
of restarting this medication.
[] On discharge from rehab, would benefit from ongoing 
outpatient case management discussions around optimizing home 
services
[] Patient should get gastric motility/gastric emptying study 
for concern of gastroparesis 
[] Cardiology follow-up: Patient may not need diltiazem or may 
benefit from reduced dosing, and this may be contributing to 
chronic lightheadedness/dizziness --Continue to down titrating 
as tolerated
[] If patient develops diarrhea, consider decreasing bowel 
regimen. Aggressive regiment was started in hospital due to 
constipation.
[] Some formulations of zantac have been found to have 
carcinogens in them, consider transitioning to alternative agent 
on discharge 

ACUTE ISSUES
=============
#Nausea/vomiting
#Gastroenteritis vs gastroparesis
Patient presented with sudden onset of nausea, vomiting, and 
diarrhea, likely consistent with viral gastroenteritis. Her 
symptoms improved over the course of her stay with symptomatic 
management. Gastroparesis is also a consideration, so an 
outpatient gastric empty study should be considered.

#Lightheadedness
Patient has chronic dizziness in which work-up so far has been 
unrevealing, including head CT, ECHO, ENT consult. Likely that 
orthostasis from underlying GE worsened her chronic dizziness. 
Also considered some blunting of her cardiac response to 
orthostasis in the setting of her multiple nodule blocking 
agents, as her HRs were in the ___ while in house. Her diltiazem 
was downtitrated to 240mg daily with improvements in her heart 
rates to 60-70s. Would consider alternative antihypertension 
therapy as an outpatient

CHRONIC ISSUES
===============
#HTN
On admission was hypertensive. Received home carvedilol with 
reduced lisinopril of 20mg which was titrated back to 40mg. Home 
furosemide held in setting of acute illness but resumed on 
discharge. Diltiazem as above.

#DM2
Last A1C 6.6 on ___. Takes glargine 30 units qAM at home. 
Initially decreased while having poor PO intake, then restarted 
home regiment prior to discharge. Would continue to titrate 
insulin therapy up as outpatient

Greater than 40 mins were spent on discharge planning and 
coordination of care.
