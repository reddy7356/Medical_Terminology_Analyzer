Discharge Labs:
 
Imaging:
CTA Torso - IMPRESSION:   
1. Substantial increase in size of an infrarenal abdominal 
aortic aneurysm now measuring up to 7.2 cm. Although there is no 
evidence of rupture, there is irregular luminal enhancement 
which raises the concern of impending rupture.   
2. Linear area of hypoenhancement within the aneurysm sac 
beginning just below the renal arteries either mixing artifact 
or focal dissection.   
3. Severe atherosclerotic disease.   
4. Bronchiectasis and mucous plugging in the right upper lobe.   

5. Enlarged pulmonary trunk suggestive of pulmonary 
hypertension. 
6. Large bowel containing complex ventral hernia, no evidence of 
obstruction.   

 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ is a ___ woman with PHMx of dementia, paroxysmal afib on 
Coumadin, DM2, COPD on 5L O2, CAD, CKD, diastolic heart failure, 
carcinoid tumor, AAA, who presented to OSH with 5 days of 
abdominal discomfort where CT imaging showing increase in 
diameter of her AAA and transferred here for vascular surgery 
evaluation.
   
# AAA: The patient presents with several days of abdominal 
"ache" with CTA at OSH showing increase in size of AAA. Vascular 
surgery consulted and reported that there were no surgical 
options at this time, given the anatomy of the patient's AAA and 
the patient's severe medical comorbidities. She was admitted to 
medicine for BP control and for placement. The admitting 
provider and this provide both discussed the findings with the 
patient and her HCP/son and reiterated the risk of death should 
this AAA rupture, and the CT shows impending rupture.  Clearly 
the patient feels she is at the end of her life and accepting 
that she will one day die, and does not want life sustaining 
measures should something occur. She was transitioned to DNR/DNI 
which was documented in chart, POE and MOLST. We also discussed 
restarting ___ versus witholding warfarin. We discussed the 
risks and benefits of each which included but was not limited 
to, if we hold warfarin her risk of a life-threatening bleed 
related to AAA reduces and she would not need INR monitoring, 
while at the risk of stroke increases. On the other hand, 
holding warfarin may benefit from AAA standpoint at the risk of 
increase in strokes. The patient and son/HCP decided that the 
morbidity associated with a stroke would not outweight the 
prolonged life benefit on not anticoagulating, and morbidity of 
stroke is not consistent with the quality of life she is 
interested in. They both would rather take the risk of a 
life-threatening bleed than have her live with a possible 
debilitating stroke. They both again indicated that she is not 
interested in surgery anyway, and that she lived a long 
enjoyable life and "when [her] time comes, so be it." Patient's 
abdominal pain resolved without further intervention. Blood 
pressure remained well controlled while inpatient, and she was 
discharged on prior home regimen. ___ will assist with blood 
pressure and cardiovascular monitoring. PCP ___ follow for any 
medication adjustments. 

# COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT: 
# DEMENTIA: Patient's son expressed concern about patient's 
ability to care for herself / manage medications at home. The 
son expressed desire that patient could potentially be 
discharged to facility following discharge. Patient was 
ultimately discharged home as her preferred SNF was not 
available and she/family requested discharge home. ___ 
consults assisted with evaluation. Patient is given added level 
of support with palliative care referral through home services. 
She will follow with ___ and social worker. 
     
# CKD, Stage III: Cr 1.5 at OSH, 1.4 here. Review of CHA records
shows that she seems to be at her baseline (1.6 in ___ and 
1.5
in ___.
  
# COPD: On 5L O2 per report. Denies any respiratory complaints 
at
this time. Continued on home albuterol and Spiriva.
   
# AFIB: 
On Coumadin for anticoagulation and metoprolol for rate control. 
Of note, she was given KCentra and vitamin K in the ED out of 
concern for possible upcoming surgical procedure. INR 2.6 
reduced to 1.4, but regained therapeutic levels prior to 
discharge. CHADS-Vasc score is 7 indicating significant risk of 
stroke. Per discussion with HCP (see above) restarted Warfarin 
with next scheduled INR check on ___ with ___ 
___ coagulation clinic (confirmed). 
  
# CHRONIC DIASTOLIC HEART FAILURE: 
No signs of volume overload. Patient was continued on home 
Lasix. 
  
# HTN: BP control as above

# DM2: 
- Home Lantus reduced dose was prescribed at time of discharge. 
Close monitoring and charting is recommended (patient has new 
meter 1 week old). Alarm symptoms of hyperglycemia and 
hypoglycemia was reviewed. Patient will likely need dose 
adjustment when she resumes home diet, though compliance with 
consistent carbohydrate diet is recommended. 
  
# HLD: Continue home statin.
