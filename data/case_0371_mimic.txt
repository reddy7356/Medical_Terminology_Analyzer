IMAGING AND STUDIES
===================
___ ECHO (TTE)
The left atrial volume index is normal. There is mild symmetric 
left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and global 
systolic function. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal 
wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Quantitative 
(biplane) LVEF = 69 %. The estimated cardiac index is normal 
(>=2.5L/min/m2). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased 
left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Right 
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The 
aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened. There is 
moderate aortic valve stenosis (valve area 1.0-1.2cm2). Mild 
(1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are 
mildly thickened. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. The 
estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. 
Significant pulmonic regurgitation is seen. 

IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Moderate aortic valve 
stenosis. Mild aortic regurgitation. Mild symmetric left 
ventricular hypertrophy with preserved regional and global 
biventricular systolic function. Increased PCWP. 

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of ___, 
the aortic valve gradient is slightly higher with similar 
calculated aortic valve area. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
PATIENT SUMMARY
================
___ year old woman with history of moderate aortic stenosis with 
EF 55%, mild mitral regurgitation, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, 
who presents with chest pressure and tightness at rest, admitted 
for evaluation of unstable angina. 

ACUTE ISSUES
============
#Unstable angina
Patient with chest pain at rest, however no EKG changes and 
negative troponins x3, most consistent with stable angina. Given 
her known aortic stenosis, ECHO was performed to rule out 
structural changes. Aortic stenosis was largely unchanged, and 
next step in workup was nuclear stress test. Patient was 
hemodynamically stable and without chest pain or concerning 
telemetry findings, and requested to have this done as 
outpatient. One was scheduled for her in ___ on ___, in 
three days. Home medications, including metoprolol, aspirin, and 
simvastatin were continued. Lisinopril was held as below, then 
restarted. 

___ on CKD Stage III
CKD due to microvascular disease and chronic gout. Baseline Cr 
1.4, was up to 1.7 on presentation. Likely pre-renal, has 
improved and patient w hypertensive reading, so restarted home 
lisinopril 40mg. Encouraged patient to take in PO fluids and 
solutes to augment hydration status. 

#Hyponatremia
Unclear etiology, Na was 132-133 consistently during admission. 
Urine electrolytes were checked and were not consistent with 
pre-renal etiology (FENa is 1.2%, Cr 63, Na 58, K 34, Osm 363). 
Patient not on diuretics and appeared hypovolemic to euvolemic 
throughout hospitalization. Should be follow-up outpatient and 
further work-up if persistent. 

CHRONIC ISSUES
==============
#Hypertension: Held lisinopril initially given ___, restarted 
prior to discharge. 
#Gout: Continued with feboxostat. 
#GERD: Continued with home omeprazole. 

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES
==================
[ ] Follow-up outpatient stress test, further work-up and 
management pending these results
[ ] Repeat BMP on ___ while at ___ for stress test to 
evaluate serum Na levels (order placed in OMR for outpatient 
labs)
[ ] Hyponatremia-unclear etiology, new for this patient, further 
work-up pending labs that will be checked outpatient ___.
[ ] Patient given prescription for Zofran for nausea, which she 
was experiencing in hospital. Unclear etiology, if she continues 
to require Zofran and/or is having nausea, please initiate 
further work-up.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,

It was a pleasure being involved in your care. 

Why you were admitted to the hospital:
======================================
You were admitted to the hospital because you were having chest 
pain. 

What happened in the hospital:
==============================
- You had a cardiac ultrasound (also called an "echo") which did 
not show any significant changes to your aortic valve or other 
parts of your heart structure. 
- We arranged for a stress test to be done outpatient as you 
were stable and wanted to return home rather than wait in the 
hospital. 
- Your blood levels of sodium were a little bit low, we want to 
continue monitoring this after you leave the hospital. 

What you should do when you leave the hospital:
===============================================
- Take all of your medications as described below. 
- Attend all of your follow-up appointments as described below. 
- Have labs done at ___ lab on ___ (when you 
go for your stress test), there is already an order in their 
computer system for you to have these drawn, you just need to 
show up there. 
- We gave you some Zofran for nausea - as we are not sure what 
the cause of your nausea is, if you continue to have it please 
bring this up with your primary care doctor. 

We wish you the best!
Your ___ Team

TAVR report ___: 

Interventional Details
The patient was counseled extensively regarding the risks, 
benefits, and alternatives to the procedure and after answering 
all questions, the patient yielded informed consent. The patient 
was thereafter brought tothe catheterization laboratory and 
monitored anesthesia care was delivered. Preprocedural 
antibiotic was administered intravenously. The nature of this 
procedure required multidisciplinary planning and management 
with the cardiac surgery, interventional cardiology and 
anesthesia physicians. All members of the heart team were 
present for the following key components of the procedure 
according ___ guidelines: Vascular access Catheter placement, 
Device implantation, Vascular closure, Intraprocedural 
medication ordering. Sterile technique was used throughout the 
case. All vascular access was obtained using modified Seldinger 
technique and ultrasound guidance. An ___ sheath was placed in 
the left femoral vein and ___ sheaths were placed in the right 
and left femoral artery. The ___ sheath in the right femoral 
artery was removed and the arteriotomy was measured with the 
Manta device, and the access site was upsized to an ___ sheath. A 
___ Angled Pigtail catheter was advanced to the aortic root via 
the left femoral artery sheath and aortic root angiography was 
performed. A temporary pacing wire was placed in the right 
ventricle via the left femoral vein sheath. Next, the ___ sheath 
in the right femoral artery was exchanged over an Amplatz 
Extrastiff for the ___ sheath. A pigtail catheter was advanced 
to the aortic root. Using a 0.035" straight wire, the aortic 
valve was crossed. Over the wire, the angled pigtail catheter 
was advanced across the valve. Baseline hemodynamics (left heart 
catheterization) were obtained. A preshaped curved wire was 
advanced into the LV and the JR-4 catheter was removed. Next, 
the Enveo delivery system was delivered to the ascending aorta 
and the aortic valve was crossed in a retrograde fashion. After 
confirming appropriate placement across the aortic valve using 
aortic root angiogaphy, the valve was deployed with rapid 
ventricular pacing at 100 bpm. Echocardiography and aortic root 
angiography revealed a well-placed and well-seated valve, with 
no aortic regurgitation. Next, the delivery catheter system was 
removed. An angled pigtail catheter was advanced into the LV and 
repeat hemodynamics (left heart catheterization) were obtained.

The sheath was removed over a wire, and the right femoral artery 
device access site was successfully closed using the Manta 
device. The contralateral arteriotomy was closed with an 
Angioseal device. The
temporary pacemaker was removed, and manual compression 
hemostasis was applied to the venous sheath. The patient 
tolerated the procedure well. Patient was transferred to the CV 
Post Anesthesia care
unit for further management.
Complications: There were no clinically significant 
complications. Of note, her Hb was noted to be low pre-procedure 
(on routine pre-procedure labs). No active bleeding reported 
and/or noted. Decision was
made to give her 2 units PRIOR to the TAVR, routinely before the 
procedure.
I was physically present during all critical and key components 
of the procedure and in compliance with the CMS regulations.

TTE ___: 
Pre-TAVR: There is suboptimal image quality to assess regional 
left ventricular function. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is normal. The right ventricle has 
normal free wall motion. The aortic valve leaflets
are severely thickened. There is SEVERE aortic valve stenosis 
(valve area 1.0 cm2 or less). There is mild [1+]
mitral regurgitation.
Post-TAVR: The Evolut Pro TAVR prosthesis is well seated with 
normal leaflet motion and normal gradient.
There is a paravalvular jet of trace aortic regurgitation is 
seen.

TTE ___: The left atrial volume index is normal. There is no 
evidence for an atrial septal defect by 2D/color Doppler. The 
estimated right atrial pressure is ___ mmHg. There is mild 
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with a normal cavity 
size. There is normal regional and global left ventricular 
systolic function. Quantitative biplane left ventricular 
ejection fraction is 60 % (normal 54-73%). There is no resting 
left ventricular outflow tract gradient. No ventricular septal 
defect is seen. Tissue Doppler suggests an increased left 
ventricular filling
pressure (PCWP greater than 18 mmHg). Normal right ventricular 
cavity size with normal free wall motion. The aortic sinus 
diameter is normal for gender with a normal ascending aorta 
diameter for gender. The aortic
arch diameter is normal with a normal descending aorta diameter. 
An Evolut Pro aortic valve bioprosthesis is present. The 
prosthesis is well seated with normal gradient. There is no 
aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve
leaflets appear structurally normal with no mitral valve 
prolapse. There is trivial mitral regurgitation. The pulmonic 
valve leaflets are not well seen. There is mild pulmonic 
regurgitation. The tricuspid valve is not well
seen. There is physiologic tricuspid regurgitation. The 
estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There is 
no pericardial effusion.

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted for a trans catheter aortic valve replacement 
(TAVR) to treat your aortic valve stenosis which was done on 
shortness of breath. By repairing the valve your heart can pump 
blood more easily and your shortness of breath should improve. 

We found your blood levels to be critically low when you were 
admitted. We consulted GI and you had an EGD/colonoscopy. They

levels are now stable. Please have your labs checked as an 
outpatient next week and follow up with your GI doctor. 

 It is very important to take all of your heart healthy 
medications. In particular, you are now taking Aspirin. This 
medication helps to prevent blood clots from forming on the new 
valve. If you stop this medication or miss ___ dose, you risk 
causing a blood clot forming on your new valve. This could cause 
it to malfunction and it may be life threatening. Please do not 
stop taking Aspirin without taking to your heart doctor, even if 
another doctor tells you to stop the medications.  

 You will need prophylactic antibiotics prior to any dental 
procedure. Please inform your dentist about your recent cardiac 
procedure, and obtain a prescription from your doctor before any 
procedure.
  
 Please weigh yourself every day in the morning after you go to 
the bathroom and before you get dressed. If your weight goes up 
by more than 3 lbs in 1 day or more than 5 lbs in 3 days, please 
call your heart doctor or your primary care doctor and alert 
them to this change. Your weight at discharge is 124.12 lb.  
 
 We may have made changes to your medication list, so please 
make sure to take your medications as directed. You will also 
need to have close follow up with your heart doctor and your

 If you were given any prescriptions on discharge, any future 
refills will need to be authorized by your outpatient providers, 
primary care or cardiologist.  

 If you have any urgent questions that are related to your 
recovery from your procedure or are experiencing any symptoms 
that are concerning to you and you think you may need to return
