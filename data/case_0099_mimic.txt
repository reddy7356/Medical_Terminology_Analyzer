Other Relevant Studies:

CXR (___): PA and lateral radiographs of the chest. Lungs are 
clear without focal opacity, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax. 
The heart is normal in size with median sternotomy wires and 
valvular prosthesis noted. IMPRESSION: No acute intrathoracic 
process. 

TTE (___): The left atrium is elongated. There is mild 
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size 
and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%). The aortic 
root is mildly dilated at the sinus level. The ascending aorta 
is mildly dilated. A bileaflet aortic valve prosthesis is 
present. The aortic valve prosthesis appears well seated, with 
normal disc motion and transvalvular gradients. No masses or 
vegetations are seen on the aortic valve, but cannot be fully 
excluded due to suboptimal image quality. Trace aortic 
regurgitation is seen. [The amount of regurgitation present is 
normal for this prosthetic aortic valve.] The mitral valve 
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve 
prolapse. No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve. 
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The pulmonary artery 
systolic pressure could not be determined. There is no 
pericardial effusion. 
IMPRESSION: No valvular vegetations or clinically-significant 
regurgitant valvular disease seen, although transthoracic 
assessment of aortic valve prosthesis is inherently suboptimal. 
Normal global and regional biventricular systolic function. 
Normally-functioning bileaflet aortic valve prosthesis. 

TEE (___) (Preliminary Report): No spontaneous echo contrast 
or thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium/left atrial 
appendage or the body of the right atrium/right atrial 
appendage. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color 
Doppler. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal 
(LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion 
are normal. There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic 
aorta. A bileaflet aortic valve prosthesis is present. The 
prosthetic aortic valve leaflets appear normal. The aortic valve 
prosthesis leaflets appear to move normally. No masses or 
vegetations are seen on the aortic valve. Trace aortic 
regurgitation is seen which is physiologic for this valve. The 
mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral 
regurgitation. No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral 
valve. There is no pericardial effusion. 
IMPRESSION: Normally functioning bileaflet aortic valve without 
evidence of endocarditis. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ is a ___ year old male with a history rheumatic fever 
s/p mechanical aortic valve replacement in ___ who presented 
with a leukocytosis and fever to 102, admitted to ___ for rule 
out of endocarditis and elucidation of fever source. 
.
ACTIVE ISSUES:
.
#. Fever/Leukocytosis: 
The acute development of fever and leukocytosis was likely from 
infection, however the patient had no localizing symptoms to aid 
in narrowing the differential. He may have had a viral illness 
however he had no flu-like symptoms other than fever and chills. 
His chest x-ray and lung exam were not suggestive of pneumonia. 
He had no GI symptoms, jaundice, or abdominal tenderness to 
suggest hepatitis, and LFT's were within normal limits. He had 
no meningeal signs, headache, or photophobia to suggest 
meningitis. He had no recent medication changes or rashes to 
suggest drug fever. The main concern at the time of admission 
was endocarditis, given his artificial valve,  dental work 3 
months prior, and paucity of localizing signs or symptoms to 
suggest another explanation for fever and leukocytosis. However 
blood cultures X 3 prior to antibiotics showed no growth. His 
TTE and TEE were negative for vegetation. 
The most likely explanation for this patient's fever was Acute 
Prostatitis or a viral illness. The patient did not complain of 
urinary symptoms however he has a history of UTI's in the past. 
His UA was negative for nitrites but had 15WBC's, which is 
consistent with his urine culture showing enterococcus. Cystitis 
alone is unlikely to produce fever to 102. His prostate was not 
tender on exam, however this does not rule out prostatitis. He 
had no CVA tenderness or other signs to suggest pyelonephritis. 
Therefore he was started on Ampicillin 2g IV q4h per Infectious 
Disease recommendations. He was discharged on Augmentin 
875/125mg PO BID to complete a 14 day course of antibiotics (END 
___. He will ___ with ___ clinic on ___ at 10am if he 
continues to have fever or symptoms. Should he continue to have 
fever at that point he will likely require workup for less 
common causes of fever including malignancy. 
.
#. Acute Prostatitis: As discussed above, ___ 2g IV q4h 
was given while inpatient and he was discharged on Augmentin 
875/125mg PO BID to complete a 14 day course of antibiotics. 

#. Rheumatic heart disease, s/p mechanical AVR in ___: His INR 
goal is 2.0-3.0. 
INR therapeutic today at 2.7. He was discharged on his home dose 
of Coumadin 2.5mg daily. He is scheduled to ___ with his 
cardiologist, Dr. ___ on ___. 
.
#. Hyperglycemia: fasting glucoses on AM BMPs were consistently 
elevated therefore a hemoglobin A1c was checked. HgbA1c was 6.5 
which is diagnostic of diabetes. The patient should ___ 
with his PCP for discussion of life style modification and 
potential therapeutic interventions. He is scheduled to see Dr. 
___ week. 
.
#. Hypertension: Stable, well controlled. He was continued on 
Amlodipine 10mg daily, Atenolol 25 mg daily, and Lisinopril 10 
mg daily. 
.
INACTIVE ISSUES:
.
#. Gout:  Stable during admission. The patient was not treated 
with any medication for gout.
.  
#. Hyperlipidemia: Continue home Simvastatin 20mg Daily 
.
PENDING AT THE TIME OF DISCHARGE:  Final TEE report. Blood 
cultures from ___ and urine culture ___. 
.  
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
.
- CODE: Confirmed Full

- Will need PCP ___ regarding HbA1c of 6.5
