.
# Presyncope: Pt with symptoms of lightheadedness, palpitations, 
SOB concerning for symptomatic paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. 
However, EKG did not capture afib and no events on tele 
throughout hospitalization, including during exercise when 
patient reported subjective palpitations. She remained rate 
controlled in the ___ throughout stay. Because it was 
possible that her PAF was not captured during hospitalization, 
she was discharged with ___ of Hearts monitor for follow up. 
Considered PE but this was deemed extremely unlikely because was 
not hypoxic and symptoms had been present for weeks. Did have 
orthostatic hypotension which responded to 2 liters IVF so 
possible that recent PNA and possible new eosinophilic pneumonia 
(see problem 2) contributed via insensible losses.  She is on 2 
beta blockers (sotalol and atenolol) at home which we continued 
here. She may need echocardiogram as outpatient to assess for 
valvular disease contributing to presyncope.

___, coinciding with onset of presyncopal symptoms. CT chest 
performed at ED showed new opacities in apical RUL, LLL, and 
mildly in lateral segment RLL. Her pulmonologist Dr. ___ 
___ her throughout hospitalization and felt that, given her 
hiatal hernia, she may be having recurrent aspiration pneumonias 
but that currently her chest CT was actually much improved since 
before. She remained afebrile without cough,fever or 
leukocytosis throughout hospitalization and did not require 
antibiotics. Oxygen saturation was difficult to monitor.  On 
finger oximetry, oxygen saturations would record as ___ with 
ambulation.  However, oxygen saturation with tape oximetry on 
forehead recorded ___ with ambulation.  Per her pulmonologist, 
patient often had unreliable finger oximetry readings.  She will 
follow up with Dr. ___ as an outpatient. 
.
# Depression: stable on duloxetine and alprazolam
.
# OSA: Pt states that she has been having difficulties with mask 
settings and has not been using CPAP at home lately. Does not 
wish to continue CPAP while in house. She will f/u CPAP issues 
as an outpatient.

Imaging:
CT Chest ___
___ year old woman with recent acute shortness of breath. History 
of ARDS and  
   bronchiectasis with normal CXR at ___ ___. 
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: 
   evaluate for pulmonary embolism and acute infiltrate  
CONTRAINDICATIONS FOR IV CONTRAST: 
   None. 

 
 
Final Report 
INDICATION: Patient with shortness of breath, assess for 
pulmonary embolus. 
  
COMPARISONS: Chest CT of ___. 
  
TECHNIQUE: MDCT-acquired contiguous images through the chest 
were obtained 
with 2-mm slice thickness with and without intravenous contrast. 
Coronally 
and sagittally reformatted images were displayed. 
  
FINDINGS: 
  
There is no perfusion defect involving pulmonary arterries to 
suggest 
pulmonary embolus. The aorta is of normal caliber. There is no 
evidence of 
aortic dissection. Mild coronary artery calcifications are 
redemonstrated.  There is no pericardial effusion. Heart is 
mildly enlarged. There is no 
axillary lymphadenopathy. There are numerous mediastinal lymph 
nodes, none of which meet CT criteria for pathologic 
enlargement, unchanged.  
Tracheobronchial tree appears patent to subsegmental levels.  
  
Post-surgical changes related to right upper biopsy are 
redemonstrated with
local scarring and bronchiectasis. The lingular consolidation 
appears 
long-extending. There are diffuse bilateral ground-glass 
opacities, which 
appear new from ___ exam. There is no pleural effusion or 
pneumothorax. 

A 3.4 x 1.9 cm opacity of the right upper lobe is new from prior 
exam and 
likely represents an infectious focus. A 7-mm nodular opacity 
involving the left upper lobe also appears new (2:21). 
Bibasilar atelectasis is noted. 
  
Large hiatal hernia is unchanged. This study is not tailored for 

subdiaphragmatic evaluation; however, visualized portions of 
upper abdominal organs are unremarkable. Gallbladder is 
surgically absent. 
  
OSSEOUS STRUCTURES:  
  
Extensive degenerative joint changes involving the thoracic 
spine are noted.  Linear lucencies involving bilateral pedicles 
of the thoracic vertebral body (2:46) are present, which likely 
correspond to the site of prior hardware 
placement, unchanged. 
  
  
IMPRESSION: 
  
1. No evidence of pulmonary embolus or acute aortic syndrome. 
  
2. Diffuse bilateral ground-glass opacities and biapical nodular 
opacities, are new since ___ exam. These findings are 
concerning for infection or edema. The lingular consolidation 
appears long-extending. Post-surgical changes related to right 
upper lung biopsy with associated bronchiectasis and scarring is 
stable. 
  
3. Large hiatal hernia, unchanged. 
 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ w/PMHx chronic bronchiectasis admitted from pulmonary clinic 
with worsening malaise, dyspnea noted to desaturate with 
ambulation and CT chest demonstrating worsening ground glass 
opacities consistent with PNA. 

Active issues:
# PNA on chronic bronchectasis  
The patient was admitted directly from pulmonary clinic based on 
her symptom profile and the initial read of her chest CT scan. 
On arrival to the floor she was slightly anxious and reported 
dyspnea.  Her oxygen saturation while in bed was 98% on room 
air, but the patient reported that she still did not feel like 
she was getting enough air. An order was placed for albuterol 
and ipratropium nebs in order to improve airflow and ideally 
reduce her subjective sensation of dyspnea.

As part of her workup for pneumonia, blood and sputum cultures 
were sent for analysis, as were serum chemistries. Per 
pulmonology recs, the patient was started on empiric HCAP 
coverage, which entailed Vancomycin 1000 mg IV Q 12H, Cefepime 2 
g IV Q8H, and Azithromycin 500 mg PO initially (switched to 
250mg after first dose). A CPAP was administered to the patient 
at her home settings.

The next morning, the patient reported that her dyspnea had 
decreased, and she appeared less anxious.  Per the patient's 
pulmonologist, Cefepime was discontinued. A PICC line was 
placed, and after discussion with the patient and her family, 
she was discharged with home administration of IV vancomycin via 
___.

# Palpitations  
The patient has a history of SVT treated with sotalol, and was 
very direct in stating her wishes to be maintained on this 
medication in addition to her atenolol.  Given the potential 
interaction between Azithromycin and Sotalol, the sotalol was 
initially held while the atenolol was continued. Prior to 
discharge, the patient was restarted on sotalol with before and 
after ECGs to ensure that there was no change in the QT 
interval. The patient was discharged on her original doses of 
the sotalol and atenolol without further complaint of 
palpitations.

Chronic issues:
# OSA  
CPAP was used at the patient's home settings. There was no 
change in the course of this condition during the 
hospitalization.

# Anxiety  
The patient's home duloxetine and alprazolam doses were 
continued, and this issue remained stable throughout her stay.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,

You were admitted to the hospital from your pulmonologist's 
office for shortness of breath and suspicion of a pneumonia. 
During your stay you were treated with albuterol and ipratropium 
inhalers in order to make your breathing more comfortable. Per 
the recommendations of your pulmonologist, you were started on 
several antibiotics for pneumonia, including azithromycin (by 
mouth), and vancomycin and cefepime by IV. 

Due to a potentially harmful interaction between azithromycin 
and sotalol, it was necessary to hold your home dose of sotalol 
until an electrocardiogram could be taken before and after your 
sotalol was given.

No changes have been made to your home medications; however, in 
order to continue your course of antibiotics, it was necessary 
to administer a PICC line, a type of IV that will allow you to 
continue receiving IV antibiotics at home. You will receive IV 
antibiotics at home via the assistance of a ___.

The following medications were added to your medication regimen:
- Vancomycin 1000mg via IV, twice per day for two weeks
  - this will be administered by your ___
- Azithromycin 250 mg by mouth once a day for three more days

In the event that you begin feeling feverish, weak, or short of 
breath, please contact your doctor, or go to the nearest 
emergency room.
 
Followup Instructions:
___
