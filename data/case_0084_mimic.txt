Video EEG Monitoring

 
History of Present Illness:
The pt is a ___ year-old right-handed woman who presents for
further evaluation of her seizures.  The patient reports that 
she
first started having seizures ___ years ago.  At that time she
reportedly had a grand mal seizure in her sleep.  Her husband 
was
in bed with her, and woke up because the bed started shaking. 
She notes loss of consciousness during this time, and when she
did finally wake up she had bite marks on her tongue.  Since 
that
time she has had intermittant episodes where she will start
feeling an aura, which she describes as a sensation ___. 
She states this will last for ~10 seconds, after which she will
begin sweating, will start breathing 'funny' and is unable to
concentrate.  This will usually last somewhere from ___ mins.
She will usually lie down during these episodes, and notes that
afterwards she will be very confused and disoriented, and will
sometimes sleep all day.  These episodes occur with varying
frequency, and seem to be more common during times of stress,
near her menstrual period and after smoking marijuana.  She does
note that from ___ she had no episodes, but they began
again in ___, and began to happen with increasing frequency, 
to
the point that in ___ she had episodes on ___ and ___.  On ___ she reports having 'a big one.'  This
episode began with her usual aura ___, and she went to 
the
bedroom to lie down.  Her husband notes that shortly afterward
she was staring off to the side, with a glazed expression on her
face.  As she came out of this episode, the patient was 
initially
mumbling non-sensical words, but eventually was able to
articulate.  She remained somewhat confused however, noting, for
example, that she was unable to remember the birthdays of her 3
children.  Since that episode happened she notes that she
continues to have some word finding difficulties, and will also
occasionally find she is unable to remember how to do tasks she
could previously perform (for example, finds herself staring at
the remote control, and can't remember how to use it).

The patient reports that she was the product of a normal
pregnancy, but was a breech birth.  Reports normal childhood
development.  She was in a car accident where she hit her head 
on
the windshield of a car in her early ___, but did not lose
consciousness, and did not seek medical attention at that time.

She reports that in the past she has had some difficulty with
maintaining appropriate Dilantin levels.  In addition to her
current medication regimen, she has also tried Tegretol, but 
this
caused significant nausea.  Her Lamictal dose was recently
increased on ___.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ is a ___ year old right-handed woman with a past 
medical history including PTSD, anxiety, and seizures who 
presented ___ for seizure characterization and adjustment of 
her anti-epileptic drug (AED) regimen while on long-term 
monitoring.  She was admitted to the Epilepsy Service, and video 
EEG recording took place over seven days.

Upon admission, clonazepam was held.  The Topamax was decreased 
before complete withdrawal on ___.  Dilantin was subsequently 
tapered (starting ___ before discontinuation on ___.  
Although the patient did awaken from sleep with myoclonic jerks 
on occasion, these events were not typical of her 'seizure' 
events and there was no EEG correlate.   She underwent an 
inter-ictal SPECT scan on ___  which demonstrated decreased 
activity in the medial portion of the right temporal lobe.  
Although the finding was considered suggestive of an epileptic 
focus, telemetry failed to show any focal slowing or 
epileptiform activity throughout the hospitalization.

Due to concerns about side effects and difficulty maintaining 
therapeutic drug levels, one of the goals of the current 
admission was to discontinue Dilantin.  The patient tolerated 
the Dilantin wean well and, as planned, the medication was not 
restarted prior to discharge.  The Topamax was also permanently 
stopped.  Nightly clonazepam was re-started with a plan to 
discontinue the drug when the Lamictal up-titration reached a 
target dose of 150 mg bid.  

In the course of the hospitalization, investigative studies 
showed no evidence of contributory toxic, metabolic, or 
infectious processes.

Although quite anxious, the patient expressed a readiness and 
desire to go home on the day of discharge.  She was otherwise 
asymptomatic.

History of Present Illness:
HPI: The pt is a ___ ___ female h/o MI s/p
stents, possible seizure disorder on Lamictal, PTSD,
anxiety/depression who presents with an episode of 3 days of
memory loss and strange behavior.  The patient reports that she
does not have any recollection of the events since last
___.  She was initially sent to ___ by her
husband who had decided that her symptoms had continued for two
long and there was a fear of seizures.  The patient was then
transferred to ___ as she has received some of her seizure 
care
here in the past (and has had a prior admission for LTM).

The patient has no recollection of the events.  She was very
upset when relating the story and could not remember when she
started to become amnestic.  On speaking with her husband, he
noted that when she woke up ___ she seemed very confused
and was not acted appropriately.  She at one point got out of 
bed
and started scolding her daughter about what time she came home,
and repeatedly questioning her.  Later in the day she had no
recollection of these events.  He also noted that she kept 
asking
questions over and over again, some of the questions were
orientation based"is it morning?" or "what day is it?"  But 
other
questions were nonsensical like "do we own a trailer?" (they 
do).
She appeared at all times to know who she was and where she was. 

She also had moments of clarity throughout this course, she
apparently spoke with her doctor on the phone yesterday, and per
the husband the conversation was appropriate and she seemed to
remember some of the details briefly.  He also noted that at
night she did not seem to be as confused, although she would
awaken in the morning with the same symptoms.  He noted
everything else appeared normal.  She did not have any focal
motor symptoms, she was able to walk and talk.  Her speech was
not slurred.  She was able to do complex motor tasks and talk
with people.  On ___ the patient was informed that this had
been going on four 3 days and she became upset and was taken to
___.
  

The husband notes that there were some recent stressors.  He is
redoing two rooms for the holidays and there has been a great
deal of dust and mess recently.  The patient was complaining
about this and the need to clean it up recently.  The husband 
has
been out of work since ___ and has a recent knee injury which
makes it difficult to attend to his wife.  He also had a near
drowning in ___ of this year.

Per the husband except for the last three days she had been 
fully
compliant with medication.

Patient reports first onset of seizures was ___ years prior.  She
had a grad mal seizure out of sleep.  As described the patient
had loss of consciousness and her husband was awoken by the bed
shaking, after this incident she was noted to have bite marks on
her tongue.  

Her main seizure types are as follows: episodes where she starts
with an aura ___, begins to sweat and breathe heavily, 
and
then has difficulty concentrating for ___ minutes, there is
some confusion afterward, sometimes sleepiness lasting the rest
of the day.  These episodes occur with varying frequency, and
seem to be more common during times of stress, near her 
menstrual
period and after smoking marijuana. 

She has one other type of episode recently. She recalls this
episode as being a "big giant".  She lay down and then had loss
of consciousness for about a minute was amnestic, although per
her husband she did not appear to have loss of consciousness. 
However he noted her head turned to the left and her gaze turned
to the left.  About a minute later then started to regain
awareness and from this point onwards recalls the events. He
described as having had dysarthric speech and being rather
disoriented.  She also has difficulty with her gait. 

She has only noted the single convulsive seizure, and has
primarily had the other type of seizure since that time with the
exception of the one listed above.

Of note the patient was admitted for LTM in ___ with an 
increase
in her seizure type reported below (dejva ___, heavy breathing,
confusion).  She had LTM and a change of medication on that
admission.  The EEG monitoring did not show any seizure activity
and did not show any correlate to her episodes.  An ___
spect was obtained at the time showed decreased activity in the
medial portion of the right temporal lobe.  Although the finding
was considered suggestive of an epileptic focus, telemetry 
failed
to show any focal slowing or epileptiform activity throughout 
the
hospitalization. She was tapered off her Dilantin and Topamax,
and was sent home to taper off her Klonopin at which time her
Lamictal was therapeutic.

She had a repeat office visit with Dr. ___ in ___, where
she was on 150mg of Lamictal a day.  It was determined that this
was an appropriate dose given the lack of EEG findings on the
last admission. It was thought that many of these symptoms may 
be
anxiety related and focusing on treatment of her underlying
anxiety may help.  However the patient did not agree with this
assessment and was upset at the time.

Birth History: Normal ___ course as known, was a breech
birth.  Normal childhood development.  In a MVA in early
___, unrestrained driver, hit head on the windshield, no
loss of consciousness however

Known triggers of events: stress, sleep deprivation, marijuana
