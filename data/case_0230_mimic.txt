Meds:  While here we initiated wellbutrin sustained release 150 
daily after discussing r/b/ae/alternatives.  He did not 
experience any adverse effects, and his mood remained stable.  
He opened up a little while here, but continued to express that 
his mood was not depressed, but he will have periods when he 
becames overwhelemed and impulsive.  We also initiated 1mg 
ativan as needed for sleep, which he tolerated and was helpful 
to his sleep.  He did continue to report nightmares, so we tried 
prazosin 2mg, but he did not feel it helped and more importantly 
made him feel dizzy when he walked, so we discontinued that.  We 
asked pt to continue wellbutrin, and increase to 150 BID in a 
few days.  He is aware that he needs to followup with outpt 
treaters to continue living in dorms, and is motivated to do 
that.

Suicide risk:
Pt reports that he tried to hang himself with a sheet in 
___, getting as far as tying sheets together and 
considering jumping out the window, and some time ago scratched 
his face in an impulsive self-harm gesture (no scar present).  
He felt suicidal when he spoke with NEU staff prior to admission 
and had made no further attempts since ___. Collateral 
revealed that his mood and functioning had greatly improved 
since ___, now with a clearer direction in classes, more 
stability in his relationships, and more friends and supports. 
He was also able to follow the advice of his girlfriend in 
seeking help for his worsening mood and suicidal thoughts, 
something he had not done in the past.

The Pt reports that since admission, he has accepted that he has 
more social support than he initially thought, and feels he can 
talk to people like his friends, GF, academic advisor (who is 
very close to him) and family.  He was able to list multiple 
coping skills that he finds helpful when feeling overwhelmed 
(writing poetry, exercising, calling friends, not being alone. 
If he feels unsafe he also appeared willing and able to call ___ 
or go to his new therapist if he feels unsafe in the future.  
Through out his amdission he was quite future-oriented, going as 
far as interviewing a student here so he could write a paper for 
one of his classes.  He is look forward to getting back to his 
schoolwork, and has multiple majors in mind that he is very 
interested in.  He is ambitious.  He looks forward to this 
___ when he will travel abroad for school.  He plans tonight 
to take his GF to dinner for her birthday, and this weekend will 
hang out with friends.  ___ he looks forward to going 
home to see his family.  Overall he is very future-oriented, and 
anticipates using new coping skills when he feels suicidal 
and/or impulsive.  His risk of self-harm is lower than on 
admission and does not present as an acute risk. He remains at 
chronic risk to himslef in times when he is most overwhelmed and 
this was discussed with him and detailed and best managed by 
ongoing therapy and connection. 

Over the course of his admission his degree of depression and 
suicidality was discussed with his girlfriend and with his 
school advisor who will remain vigient about how he is doing and 
support him in maintianing his outpatient treatment 

Psych testing was completed over his admisison: modestly 
defensive profile, not endorsing depressive or anxiety 
symtptoms.  Elevated narcissism scale.  Only modest SI.  High in 
hypervigilance. Some increased borderline configuration 
(difficulty with relationships, impulsivity, low in self-harm). 
Testing also did not reveal concern about his acute safety risk 

4.  Psychosocial:
SW has been in touch with pt's girlfriend, who is very 
supportive.  She feels he has been improving, and feels safe 
watching him and contacting treaters/EMS if she feels he is 
unsafe.  She says they spend ~12 hours/day together, and she is 
aware of how he is doing.

5.  Milieu:  Pt did not participate in groups in general.  
Stayed isolated much of the time, but in good behvaioral control 
and polite.   Wrote poetry often and engaged with his team and 
worked on his school work
