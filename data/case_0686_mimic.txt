Right foot: There continues to be changes of Charcot 
arthropathy, most 
pronounced at the tarsal metatarsal joint and better assessed on 
the MRI from ___.  There is lisfranc dislocation at the 
tarsometatarsal joint with medial and lateral dislocation of the 
cuneiforms.  Soft tissue swelling is also noted. Calcaneal 
spurring is seen along with vascular calcifications. 
.  
Left foot: Degenerative changes are noted including at the 
tarsometatarsal joint and navicular cuneiform joint. Inferior 
calcaneal spurring is noted, and vascular calcifications are 
noted. Surgical amputation of the fifth phalanx and third distal 
phalanx are noted. There is medial subluxation of the fourth 
proximal phalanx. 
.
ULTRASOUND  BILAT LOWER EXT VEINS Study Date of ___ 3:43 
___ 
FINDINGS: There is normal compressibility, flow and augmentation 
of the bilateral common femoral, superficial femoral, and 
popliteal veins. Normal color flow and compressibility are 
demonstrated in the posterior tibial and peroneal veins. There 
is normal respiratory variation in the common femoral veins 
bilaterally. No evidence of medial popliteal fossa (___) cyst. 
 
IMPRESSION: No evidence of deep venous thrombosis in the 
bilateral lower extremity veins. 
.
CHEST PORT. LINE PLACEMENT Study Date of ___ 8:42 AM 
IMPRESSION: 
Right subclavian PICC line has its tip in the proximal SVC.  
Overall 
cardiac and mediastinal contours are within normal limits.  
There is 
calcification in the aorta, consistent with atherosclerosis.  
The right 
hemidiaphragm is elevated, which is of uncertain significance.  
Lungs are 
without evidence of focal airspace consolidation, large 
effusions, 
pneumothorax, or pulmonary edema.  Marked degenerative changes 
are seen 
involving both glenohumeral joints as well as a moderate 
degenerative changes in the thoracic spine.  No acute bony 
abnormality.  Multiple scattered tiny radiopaque nodular 
opacities suggestive of calcification.  These findings would 
favor prior granulomatous infection.  Comparison to prior chest 
radiographs would be helpful.  In their absence, clinical 
correlation would be advised and followup imaging in three to 
six months with a plain film should be considered. 
  

  

 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ with T2DM, morbid obesity, DVT/PE on coumadin here with 
charcot foot on right with significant ulceration, disruption of 
tarsal alignment, purulent drainage, and imaging concerning for 
osteomyelitis.
.
# Osteomyelitis of right foot: Per OSH MRI, patient has 
osteomyelitis of right cuboid bone as well as diffuse 
enhancement throughout tarsus and at base of metatarsals that 
could refelct osteomyelitis.  Predisposing factors include T2DM 
complicated by peripheral neuropathy and Charcot joint.  No 
known trauma to the foot; pt was unaware of ulcer until it began 
bleeding. She was started on vancomycin and zosyn at OSH with 
deep wound cultures pending. Her history of DM is concerning for 
polymicrobial osteomyelitis, including pseudomonas. She is s/p 
bone biopsy by podiatry on ___ with tissue showing negative 
gram stain and cultures with no growth to date; however, this 
could be due to antibiotic therapy initiated at OSH prior to 
bone biopsy.  She was empirically started on vancomycin and 
zosyn on ___, then transitioned to vancomycin, cefepime and 
flagyl with plan for a 6 week course (day 1 = ___.  She will 
follow up with podiatry and infectious disease for further 
management of osteomyelitis.  She should have a weekly CBC with 
diff, ESR, CRP, CHEM-7, LFTs and vanc trough. Labs should next 
be drawn on ___ with results faxed to the ___ Infectious 
Disease clinic at ___.
.
# Right foot Charcot joint:  Evaluated by podiatry who 
recommended reconstruction vs amputation.  Tentatively planning 
for reconstruction in ~2 months.  She should follow up with 
podiatry for further management.
.
# Incidental finding on CXR: Multiple scattered tiny radiopaque 
nodular opacities suggestive of calcification.  These findings 
would favor prior granulomatous infection.  Comparison to prior 
chest radiographs would be helpful.  In their absence, clinical 
correlation would be advised and followup imaging in three to 
six months with a plain film should be considered. 
.
# DM2: Complicated by peripheral neuropathy. On metformin at 
home. Last HbA1c unknown.  Held home metformin while in house 
and initiated an insulin sliding scale. She can resume metformin 
at rehab. 
.
# Lower extremity edema and stasis dermatitis: Secondar to 
chronic venous insufficiency. She had tenderness to palpation of 
bilateral calves noted on ___ bilateral ___ ultrasound 
negative for DVT. Continued home lasix.
.
# h/o DVT/PE: She is on coumadin for history of DVT/PE that 
occurred post-operatively during time when she was relatively 
immobile.  She does not have a hard indication to continue 
coumadin therapy; however, after discussion with the patient and 
her PCP, the decision was made to continue coumadin for now 
given her relative immobility and her fear of having another PE. 
Once she is more mobile, consideration should be given to 
discontinuing coumadin therapy, especially in light of the 
associated bleeding risks. Her coumadin was held for bone biopsy 
and restarted ___. She should have an INR checked on ___ 
___ and then q2-3 days until stable. INR 1.3 on ___.
.
# HTN: Stable. Continued home atenolol, lisinopril.
.
# HLD: Stable. Continued home pravastatin.

___: b/l foot x-rays
Right foot: 
There has been prior resection versus resorption of multiple 
midfoot bones. The cuboid and 2 of the cuneiforms are not 
definitely visualized. The navicular bone appears to be 
displaced inferiorly. Surgical clips are seen along the plantar 
aspect of the foot. There is diffuse soft tissue swelling. 
Alignment appears to be grossly similar when compared to the 
prior study. No periostitis seen. Soft tissue calcification 
appears to be venous. Moderate plantar calcaneal spur. 
  
Left foot: 
There has been interval surgery with a partially threaded screw 
traversing the posterior facet of the subtalar joint. An 
additional screw traverses the first metatarsal extending into 
the presumed medial cuneiform and navicular bone into the talus. 
The precise anatomy is not clearly delineated. A third screw 
traverses the calcaneocuboid articulation. There has been prior 
resection at the third fourth and fifth rays, this is unchanged 
in appearance. Severe subluxation of the first interphalangeal 
joint is also unchanged. Diffuse soft tissue swelling is noted. 
No periostitis seen. 

___: Chest x-ray:
Heart size and mediastinum are unchanged. Right PICC line has 
been 
discontinued.Small heterogeneous density projecting over the 
left upper lung  may be artifactual and related to overlapping 
structures.  This could be further evaluated with dedicated AP 
and lateral chest radiographs.  No appreciable pleural effusion 
or pneumothorax is seen.
 
Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ was admitted to the podiatric surgery service follow 
b/l charcot reconstruction foot surgery. Pt was evaluated by 
anesthesia and taken 
to the operating room on ___.  In the operating room, she 
required pressor support due to hypotension; please see the 
operative note for details.  Pt was extubated, taken to the PACU 
until stable, then transferred to the ward for observation. 

Neuro: Pain was initially managed oral oxycodone on a prn basis. 
On ___, nursing noted that the patient had become confused, 
aggitated, and paranoid. Labs, blood cultures, chest x-ray, and 
urine culture were obtained to ensure the patient did not have 
an infection. All of which were negative. When team evaluated 
the patient, she was A&Ox3 and no longer aggitated. The medicine 
team was consulted who evaluated the patient. We concluded that 
this event was likely due to oral narcotic pain medication. 
Oxycodone was discontinued and the patient was placed on 
standing acetaminophen for pain. There were no other 
neurological events for the remaining hospitalization.
CV: Vital signs were routinely monitored. The patient required 
pressor support while in the OR due to low blood pressure. 
Pressors were discontinued in PACU and her blood pressure 
medications were held. Her blood pressures remained stable in 
the 100s-110s for her remaining hospitalizations. She was placed 
on telemetry while hospitalized. On ___, her telemetry was 
alarming due to sinus arrhythmia, PVCs, and irregular heart 
rate. An ECG was preformed which revealed atrial fibullation. 
The medical consult team was following at this time and 
recommended continuing her coumadin and restarting her atenolol 
for rate control. They recommended follow up with her PCP as 
well as cardiologist for further workup.
Pulmonary: The patient remained stable from a pulmonary 
standpoint; vital signs were routinely monitored. Good pulmonary 
toilet and incentive spirometry were encouraged throughout 
hospitalization. 
GI/GU/FEN:  The patient was placed on a diabetic diet which was 
well tolerated. Patient's intake and output were closely 
monitored and found to be adequate. A foly was placed intra-op 
for urine monitoring.
ID: The patient's fever curves were closely watched for signs of 
infection, of which there were none. The patient was placed on 
post-operative ancef while hospitalized. During her neurological 
event on ___, blood cultures, urine analysis, chest x-ray, 
and labs were drawn to rule out infectious cause of delirium. 
All these results are currently negative to date. 
HEME: The patient's blood counts were closely watched for signs 
of bleeding. Her Hct was noted to be trending down initially 
during the post-operative. Her stool was guaiaced and negative. 
Her Hct stabilized on ___ and continued to trend out for her 
remaining hospitializtion.
Prophylaxis: The patient received subcutaneous heparin and ___ 
dyne boots were used during this stay. She was also placed on 
her home dose of coumadin on post-operative date 0.

At the time of discharge, the patient was doing well, afebrile

goals, she should be taken to hospice care.  As such, it was 
determined her diet should be advance to regular, despite 
aspiration risks, for comfort.  

ID: The patient's presented in sepsis. Multiple cultures were 
sent and and she was treated with Ceftriaxone and Linezolid 
based on her culture data for her wound abscess, and the course 
of those antibiotics completed ___.  Her hospitalization was 
complicated by C.diff and she was started on a course of 
metronidazole.  Upon discharge, her symptoms of C.diff were 
resolving, she was afebrile, and her WBC was 6.3 with no signs 
of systemic infection. 

HEME: The patient's blood counts were closely watched for signs 
of bleeding- during her hospitalization she received 2U PRBC for 
low Hct. There were no overt signs of bleeding, and the likely 
reason for her low Hct was due to multiple lab draws needed to 
monitor her care.  

Prophylaxis: The patient received a heparin gtt and ___ dyne 
boots for anticoagulaton (for Afib) and prophylaxis. She will 
not be discharged home on coumadin, based on her goals of care 
and discharge to hospice.
