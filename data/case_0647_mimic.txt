Procedure date     Tissue received     Report Date    Diagnosed 
by 
___ ___. ___ 
Previous biopsies:    ___  CELL BLOCK, PLEURAL FLUID:  

DIAGNOSIS: 
Pleura, right parietal, biopsy (A):
Adenocarcinoma, infiltrating fibroadipose tissue, see Note.
Note: See prior pleural effusion cell block specimen 
(___) for immunohistochemical characterization. 
 
    
REPORT APPROVED DATE: ___ 
SPECIMEN RECEIVED: ___    ___    RIGHT PARIETAL PLEURA 

DIAGNOSIS: FNA, Right parietal pleura: 
    
  POSITIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS. 
  Consistent with metastatic adenocarcinoma.  
  
REPORT APPROVED DATE: ___ 
SPECIMEN RECEIVED: ___    ___    PLEURAL FLUID 
DIAGNOSIS: Right pleural effusion: 
    
  POSITIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS. 
  Consistent with metastatic adenocarcinoma. 

IMAGING 
CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date o ___ 5:43 ___ 
FINDINGS:  The patient is now after thoracoscopy, right basal 
chest tube is in place, there is a small adjacent right 
basolateral pneumothorax without evidence of tension.  The right 
pleural effusion is greatly improved after the intervention; 
however, a small amount of fluid remains in the pleural space.  
A heterogeneous opacity in the right lower lung is likely a 
combination of free expansion edema and atelectasis.  Minimal 
atelectasis is also seen at the left lung bases.  Unchanged mild 
deviation of the upper trachea to the left.  The size of the 
cardiac silhouette remains at the upper range of normal. 

CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of ___ 8:34 AM 
FINDINGS:  Two chest tubes remain in place in the right 
hemithorax.  
Circumferential right pleural opacity corresponding to a 
combination of 
pleural thickening and pleural fluid appear relatively similar 
to the prior radiograph.  Adjacent lung opacities remain most 
marked within the right middle and right lower lobe and show 
only slight improved aeration in these regions.  Diffuse 
interstitial pattern in right lung could reflect lymphangitic 
carcinomatosis given the history of malignancy.  A persistent 
small left effusion is present. 
 
Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ is an ___ yo man with a history of metastatic NSCLC 
to T11, mediastinal LAD, and malignant pleural effusion who 
presents POD#3 following a talc pleurodesis, pleural biopsy, and

- Will continue ciprofloxicin by po x ___s outpatient
- encouraged to increase hygiene at site of urethreal conduit 
following penectomy.
.
# Hypoxemia: due to pleural effusion. He has many pack years and 
may have baseline COPD that has been undiagnosed.  continued O2 
at 3L NC to keep sats > 93% at home. IP is planning for 
thoracoscopy 2 days after discharge.

neoplastic pain,added oxycodone 2.5 mg prn.

# Chronic constipation: continued senna and colace as scheduled 
meds

cancer that he does not report.  continued tamulosin.

medications indicate that he has difficulty with urinary 
frequency/hesitancy and BPH. continued tamulosin and continued 
avodart (nonformulary - will asked family to bring in).
