History of Present Illness:
Mr. ___ is a ___ year old male with a PMX of DM II, Stage III-IV 
CKD with recent increase in baseline cr to 4, presenting with 
worsening shortness of breath during an outpatient nephrology 
visit. The patient notes worsening dyspnea symptoms over past 
few days. His PCP had attempted to increase his lasix dose from 
20mg to 40mg daily wihthout improvement. He endorses orthopnea 
(sleeps w/ 3+ pillows), PND, dizziness and SOB when ambulating 
but not at rest. No CP. He feels weak overall.On exam in his 
nephrologist's office he was noted to have ___ pitting edema up 
to the thighs. Urine examination showed many muddy brown casts, 
3+ protein, and sed rate 1.015. Given his worsening symptoms and 
exam, he was transferred to ED.
Additionally, he has felt nauseous without any episodes of 
emesis. No recent fevers, chills, sweats, or diarrhea. He does 
promote a decreased appetite recently. He has had a chronic 
non-productive cough which is chronic but worse over last year. 
Denies any episodes of hempotysis. He has similar admission to 
the heart failure service in ___ without clear evidence 
of hf on echo and no evidence of ischemia on stress echo 
although he only obtained 3.8 mets.
In the ED, initial vitals were: 99.3 68 181/92 20 100%. Renal 
saw the patient and recommended routine labs and diuresis. Labs 
notable for K+ 3.0, Cr 4.8, and BNP 8875. A CXR was read as 
normal without any pulm edema.He received 60mg PO lasix as well 
as 40 mEq of potassium for a K of 3.0.

IMAGING:
TTE (___): The left atrium is mildly dilated. No atrial 
septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. The estimated 
right atrial pressure is ___ mmHg. Left ventricular wall 
thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There is mild regional 
left ventricular systolic dysfunction with hypokinesis of the 
basal and mid inferior segemenst. Overall left ventricular 
systolic function is normal (LVEF 55-60%). Tissue Doppler 
imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure 
(PCWP>18mmHg). The right ventricular free wall thickness is 
normal. The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with 
normal free wall contractility. Tricuspid annular plane systolic 
excursion is normal (2.2 cm) consistent with normal right 
ventricular systolic function. The diameters of aorta at the 
sinus, ascending and arch levels are normal. The aortic valve 
leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet 
excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation. The 
mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal. Moderate (2+) 
mitral regurgitation is seen, though may be underestimated due 
to Coanda effect. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could 
not be determined. There is a moderate sized pericardial 
effusion. The effusion appears circumferential. There are no 
echocardiographic signs of tamponade. 
IMPRESSION: Mild focal left ventricular systolic dysfunction 
with overall preserved LV function. Mildly dilated right 
ventricle with normal function. At least moderate mitral 
regurgitation. Mild to moderate sized circumferential 
pericardial effusion without evidence of tamponade physiology. 
Compared with the prior exam dated ___, overall LV function 
is slightly more vigorous. Pericardial effusion size is similar. 
Degree of mitral regurgitation is more prominent (previously 
mild to moderate). Otherwise, the findings are similar.
 
Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ is a ___ year old male with a history of hypertension, 
type 2 diabetes mellitus, and stage III-IV chronic kidney 
disease with recent increase in baseline creatinine who 
presented with worsening renal function and peripheral edema.

==================================================
ACUTE ISSUES:
==================================================

# Acute on chronic kidney disease:  Patient's renal function has 
been progressively worsening over the past seveal months.  Per 
renal, most likely etiology of decompensation is progression of 
diabetic nephropathy.  Urine sediment showed no evidence of 
dysmorphic RBCs or cellular casts that might indicate another 
superimposed glomerular process, so they did not believe a 
kidney biopsy was warranted.  Hepatitis serologies and HIV were 
negative, and complement levels were normal.  Patient's 
creatinine on discharge was 6.2.

# ___ edema:  Patient met criteria for nephrotic syndrome with 24 
hour protein of >12,000 and albumin/creatinine ratio of 8.2.  
Given clear lungs, his edema was most likely secondary to 
nephrotic syndrome.  Echocardiogram was notable for mildly 
dilated RV but normal estimated RA pressure (unchanged from 
prior), so right heart failure was less likely.  Patient was 
diuresed with lasix (up to 80mg IV bid) and his edema entirely 
resolved. 

# Hypokalemia:  Potassium was low on admission (K=3) and through 
the first two days of admission despite potassium 
supplementation.  Most likely etiology of hypokalemia is 
potassium wasting from the kidney.  We started him on 
spironolactone 25mg po daily and his potassium remained stable.  
  

# Orthostatic hypotension:  Patient had symptomatic orthostatic 
hypotension on the day prior to discharge, likely secondary to 
aggressive diuresis and an increase in his anti-hypertensives.  
Orthostasis resolved with two fluid boluses and a decrease in 
labetalol and losartan doses. 

==================================================
CHRONIC ISSUES:
==================================================

# Hypertension:  Patient's blood pressure was elevated on 
admission and remained difficult to control.  His metoprolol was 
increased to 400mg po bid and losartan 50mg po daily was added 
(his lisinopril was discontinued due to cough).

# Pericardial effusion:  Echocardiogram on ___ revealed a 
pericardial effusion stable since ___.  There is no obvious 
explanation for the effusion (possibly related to 
hypoalbuminemia, BUN not high enough for uremic effusion).  
Please repeat TTE in two weeks to reassess size of effusion.

# Dyspnea and cough:  Paient endorsed stable orthopnea and DOE 
but denied resting dyspnea.  He also reported a chronic 
nonproductive cough.  There was no evidence of congestive heart 
failure.  It is possible that the pericardial effusion may be 
causing dyspnea.  We switched his lisinopril to losartan to see 
if it was ACEi-related.

# Type 2 diabetes mellitus:  Patient's blood sugars were 
well-controlled on home lantus 20 units qhs and humalog sliding 
scale with meals.  He appears to have poor insight into his 
diabetes and it is unclear whether or not he checks his blood 
sugar at home.  Please continue diabetes education.  

# Low haptoglobin/anemia:  LDH and TBili were normal so it did 
not appear that patient was hemolyzing.  Liver function tests 
were otherwise normal.  Low haptoglobin is likely the result of 
wasting through the kidney.

==================================================
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
==================================================
[ ] Please repeat echocardiogram in 2 weeks (___) to 
evaluate pericardial effusion
[ ] Furosemide was increased from 40mg po daily to 80mg po 
daily. Lisinopril was discontinued due to chronic cough and 
switched to losartan 50mg po daily.  Labetalol was increased 
from 100mg bid to ___ bid. 
[ ] Patient is scheduled for a chem 10 next week during 
follow-up appointment with renal. Please follow up on results. 
[ ] Please review diabetes education and management.  Patient 
appears to have poor insight into his diabetes and it is unclear 
if he is taking his insulin at home.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,

It was a pleasure taking care of you at ___.  You were 
admitted for leg swelling.  We found that your kidneys were not 
working well, most likely related to your diabetes.  We gave you 
higher doses of your water pill and your leg swelling improved.  
Your blood pressure was also elevated, so we increased the dose 
of your blood pressure medication and added an additional blood 
pressure medication.

Please continue to take your medications as prescribed and keep 
your follow-up appointments.  It is very important that your 
blood sugar is well-controlled.  We would like you to see Dr.

STUDIES
========
CXR ___:
Frontal and lateral radiographs of the chest. Lung volumes are 
low.  There is stable appearance of mild enlargement of the 
cardiac silhouette which is new from older prior. Likely small 
left pleural effusion is unchanged with associated atelectasis. 
No significant right pleural effusion. Slighlyt increased 
interstitial markings seen without frank pulmonary edema. No 
focal consolidation or pneumothorax.   
IMPRESSION: Mild cardiomegaly, which is new since ___, and 
small left pleural effusion. Pulmonary vascular congestion. 
 
TTE ___:
The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. Left 
ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There 
is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with 
hypokinesis of the basal to mid inferior segments. Doppler 
parameters are indeterminate for left ventricular diastolic 
function. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion 
are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally 
normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis or 
aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are structurally 
normal. Mild to moderate (___) mitral regurgitation is seen. 
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined. 
There is a small to moderate sized pericardial effusion. The 
effusion appears circumferential. There are no echocardiographic 
signs of tamponade. 
IMPRESSION: Mild focal left ventricular systolic dysfunction. 
Mild to moderate mitral regurgitation. Small to moderate 
pericardial effusion without evidence of tamponade physiology.  

CT CHEST ___:
1.  Small pericardial effusion.   
2.  Small bilateral pleural effusions, left greater than right. 
3.  Pulmonary nodules in the right lung, up to 6 mm.  If the 
patient is low risk, follow-up CT is recommended in 12 months.  
If the patient is high risk, follow-up CT is recommended in ___ 
and ___ months. 

ETT-ECHO ___:
This ___ yo IDDM man with a PMH of HTN & HLD was referred to the 
lab for evaluation of 3 months of shortness of breath and 
lightheadedness. The patient exercised for 2 minutes on ___ 
protocol and was stopped for a marked drop in systolic BP 
associated with mild pre-syncope. The estimated peak MET 
capacity was 3.8 which represents a poor exercise tolerance for 
his age. The patient denied any arm, neck, back, or chest 
discomfort or inappropriate dyspnea throughout the procedure. He 
did however report mild lightheadedness and marked bilateral 
lower extremity fatigue and soreness at a low workload. The 
lightheadedness resolved by 2 minutes post-exercise. There were 
no ST segment changes seen during exercise or recovery. The 
rhythm was sinus without ectopy. The HR increased with exercise 
but was overall blunted due to beta blockade. There was a 
significant drop in SBP at the onset of exercise (122/74 to 
80/60; confirmed with BP measurements). 
IMPRESSION: Poor functional exercise capacity. Abnormal BP 
response to 
exercise associated with mild lightheadedness at low workload. 
No 
significant ST segment changes or anginal symptoms to low 
workload. 
Echo report sent separately. 

The patient exercised for 2 minutes 0 seconds according to a 
___ treadmill protocol ___ METS) reaching a peak heart rate 
of 85 bpm and a peak blood pressure of 80/palp mmHg. The test 
was stopped because of a hypotensive response. This level of 
exercise represents a poor exercise tolerance for age. In 
response to stress, the ECG showed no ST-T wave changes (see 
exercise report for details). The blood pressure response to 
stress was abnormal/hypotensive. There was a blunted heart rate 
response to stress [beta blockade]. 
Resting images were acquired at a heart rate of 76 bpm and a 
blood pressure of 122/74 mmHg. These demonstrated regional left 
ventricular systolic dysfunction with hypokinesis of the basal 
half of the inferior wall. The remaining segments contracted 
well (LVEF = 50 %). Right ventricular free wall motion is 
normal. There is a small inferolateral pericardial effusion. 
Doppler demonstrated mild-moderate mitral regurgitation with no 
aortic stenosis, aortic regurgitation or significant resting 
LVOT gradient. 
Echo images were acquired within 33 seconds after peak stress at 
heart rates of 86 - 76 bpm. These demonstrated no new regional 
wall motion abnormalities. Baseline abnormalities persist with 
appropriate augmentation of other segments. There was 
augmentation of right ventricular free wall motion. 
IMPRESSION: Poor functional exercise capacity. No ECG changes 
with 2D echocardiographic evidence of prior myocardial 
infarction without inducible ischemia to achieved low workload. 
Abnormal hemodynamic/hypotensive response to physiologic stress. 
Mild-moderate mitral regurgitation at rest. Small inferolateral 
pericardial effusion. 

RENAL U/S WITH DOPPLER ___:
Normal waveforms of the bilateral main renal arteries, with no 
evidence of renal artery stenosis. 
 
 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ year old ___ speaking male with CKD, DM2, HTN here from 
PCP with dyspnea found to have small pericardial effusion and 
hypertension.  

ACUTE ISSUES
# Dyspnea: Patient without prior diagnosis of CHF, though PCP 
referred the patient to ___ ED because felt that DOE was 
concerning for CHF. TTE was done, which showed focal wall motion 
abnormality in basal and inferior walls, but no evidence of 
systolic or diastolic dysfunction. Given lack of CHF, the 
patient's dyspnea was thought to potentially be due to his 
pericardial effusion, hypersension in the setting of kidney 
dysfunction, or anginal equivalent. Given the new focal wall 
motion abnormality and possibility of dyspnea being anginal 
equivalent, the patient underwent a stress-TTE. He had poor 
functional exercise capacity with abnormal BP response to 
exercise associated with mild lightheadedness at low workload. 
There were no significant ST segment changes or anginal symptoms 
to low workload. Given that the patient only achieved ___ METS 
prior to his BP drop, the stress test was non-diagnostic. 
Outpatient cardiac catheterization can be considered, but was 
not felt to be necessary at this time. It was thought that the 
patient's dyspnea was most likely related to his poorly 
controlled hypertension in the setting of CKD. Pericardial 
effusion was small and not thought to be contributing to his 
shortness of breath. Throughout his admission, the patient was 
maintained on room air. Please see below for further management 
of HTN and pericardial effusion. 

# Pericardial effusion: Patient with new pericardial effusion of 
unknown etiology. History has been unrevealing as to cause. CHF 
initially was the most likely cause, given his elevated BNP and 
CXR with vascular congestion, but TTE did not indicate systolic 
or diastolic dysfunction. Next most likely would be uremic, 
though his BUN/Cr are similar to his baseline. Infectious seems 
unlikely given that he has no recent history of fevers, chills, 
other sx. However, the patient does have a chronic dry cough (no 
hemoptysis) and comes from an area with endemic TB, so this 
could be a possibility. A PPD was planted on ___ and the 
patient was instructed to have it read at his PCP's office on 
___. Other causes could be undiagnosed autoimmune disease or 
hypothyroidism, but again the patient did not have specific 
symptoms to suggest this. TSH 1.8. ___ was negative. Neoplastic 
effusion was also on the general differential, as he does have a 
smoking history, but seemed a more remote possibility. CT chest 
was performed, which showed a 6 mm nodule that will require 
follow-up in 6 months, but no evidence of malignancy. Throughout 
the patient's stay his pulses was wnl. There was no sign of

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,

It was a pleasure taking care of you at ___.

You were referred to the ED after you presented to your PCP with 
shortness of breath. During your stay you were found to have a 
small fluid collection around your heart, which was likely 
unrelated to your symptoms. Your blood pressure was difficult to 
control while in the hospital and some new medications needed to 
be added. This elevated blood pressure and your kidney disease 
are likely contributing to your shortness of breath. 

Please continue to take your medications as prescribed. Please 
follow-up with your PCP and your new cardiologist at the 
appointments listed below. 
 
Followup Instructions:
___
