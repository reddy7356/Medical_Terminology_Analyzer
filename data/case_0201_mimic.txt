History of Present Illness:
___ with HCV cirrhosis, esophageal varices with history of
bleeding (s/p TIPS on ___, and HCC who presents from liver
tumor clinic today with hepatic encephalopathy and a new adrenal
mass. His medical history is plagued by intermittent
non-adherence and loss of insurance. He had a surveillance CT

RADIOLOGY:
================
CT ABD & PELVIS W/ CONTRAST:  
1. Hepatic cirrhosis. While no focal hepatic lesion is 
suspicious for  hepatocellular carcinoma, a 1 cm vague area of 
nonspecific washout within segment III is noted without 
associated arterial hyperenhancement. Recommend attention on 
followup CT/MR imaging.  
2. Splenomegaly with extensive esophageal and gastric varices as 
well as massive splenorenal shunt, compatible with portal 
hypertension. No ascites or lower gastrointestinal varices.  
3. 1 cm left renal calculus resulting in mild left pelviectasis 
and  
hyperenhancement of the left renal pelvis and proximal left 
ureteral  urothelium which may be secondary to inflammatory 
versus infectious  etiologies. Correlation with urinalysis is 
recommended.  
4. Colonic diverticulosis without evidence of acute 
diverticulitis

CXR: No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality.

RUQ U/S:

esophageal/gastric varices, hepatic encephalopathy w/ MELD 10, 
Childs A, admitted with melena. 

## GI Bleed:
Required 2 units PRBCs on arrival. He remained hemodynamically 
stable and hemoglobin stable without requiring any further 
transfusions. Underwent initial endoscopy, which showed 
esophageal varicies, esophagitis, portal hypertensive 
gastropathy, gastric fundus varices but no active bleeding. 
Initial colonoscopy was limited due to poor bowel prep. Repeat 
colonoscopy showed angioectasias in colon, polyps, 
diverticulosis, and rectal varices with no stigmata of recent 
bleeding. Since no evidence of bleeding on colonoscopy, and 
patient unwilling to undergo further evaluation with capsule, 
underwent repeat endoscopy with glue injection of gastric 
varices, which the patient tolerated well. The patient remained 
hemodynamically stable and was discharged with a stable 
hemoglobin.  

## HCV Cirrhosis: 
Patient has a history of HCV cirrhosis complicated by esophageal 
and gastric varices, and hepatic encephalopathy. HCV viral load 
___. There was no evidence of ascites on ultrasound.  
He also had no evidence of hepatic encephalopathy on physical 
exam. Per prior notes, responded to anti-TNF agents alpha agents 
in past, but insurance issues have made it difficult to obtain 
medications. His liver function tests remained stable during 
admission.  He was continued on lactulose, rifaximin and 
ursodiol.  He was also started on nadolol 20mg po daily prior to 
discharge.

## COPD:  
He was continued on his home albuterol inhaler and tiotropium 
bromide.

## Bipolar Disorder:  
He was continued on his home seroquel 800 mg QHS.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,

It was a pleasure taking care of you at ___ 
___.  You were admitted because you had a bleed from 
somewhere in your GI tract, likely from your stomach.  You were 
given blood transfusions when you first arrived to the emergency 
room.  During the rest of your hospital stay, your blood counts 
were very stable and you did not need any more blood 
transfusions.  

You had several endoscopies and colonoscopies to look for the 
source of the bleed.  These scopes had to be repeated because of 
poor bowel prep (there was still some stool in your colon).  We 
found varicose veins in your stomach.  We injected glue into 
these varicose veins to reduce the risk of bleeding from your GI 
tract in the future.  It is very important that you have another 
endoscopy in one month to reassess these varicose veins.  

It is also very important that you take your medications as 
prescribed.  You were started on nadolol, which will reduce the 
risk of bleeding from your GI tract in the future. It is also 
very important for you to take your omeprazole to treat the 
inflammation in your food tube (esophagitis).   

Please see the below "recommended follow-up" section for your 
upcomming appointments.

Sincerely,

Your ___ liver team

___ to ___ lesion and RFA on ___ to large left 
adrenal met and with a history ADHD, bipolar disorder, GERD, 
asthma/COPD, and ___ esophagus, presenting with shortness 
of breath, found to have altered mental status. 

His shortness of breath he attributed to the hot weather and 
improved once he was in an air-conditioned environment.  He 
never had signs of volume overload His AMS was attributed to 
hepatic encephalopathy in the setting of decreased stooling. He 
reports taking his lactulose at home, but only had 2 BMs/day 
prior to admission instead of his usual 4. In the hospital, his 
lactulose was uptitrated with improvement of his mental status 
back to baseline.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
[ ] GOALS OF CARE DISCUSSION:
- Patient without clear understanding of the next steps of 
therapy for his liver cancer.  Per last clinic note, it had been 
suggested that he meet with Palliative Care as there are no 
further therapies to treat his cancer.  We discussed this fact, 
and the patient was in understanding that there were no 
treatments to offer for his liver cancer.
- Please help the patient schedule a palliative care appointment 
to address his symptomatology, as well as psychosocial awareness 
of his prognosis.
- Please discuss transition of code status in the future, as he 
wishes to remain full code at this time.

[ ] MEDICATION CHANGES:
- Added:  Folate, thiamine, multivitamin

[ ] MEDICATION TITRATION (LACTULOSE):
- Please ensure that the patient is taking lactulose every day.
- He should take lactulose four times daily as prescribed, or 
until he reaches ___ soft bowel movements per day.
- If he is having frank diarrhea or more than 5 stools in a day, 
it is ok to hold the next scheduled dose of lactulose.

[ ] CODE: Full (confirmed)  
[ ] CONTACT:  ___ (brother) ___

ACTIVE ISSUES:
# ALTERED MENTAL STATUS:
# HEPATIC ENCEPHALOPATHY
DDx includes hepatic encephalopathy from medication 
noncompliance vs infection vs alcohol intoxication (see 
transaminitis, below) vs toxin ingestion. Infection is unlikely 
at this point given no localizing symptoms and no ascites (no 
concern for SBP). Urine tox screen was negative. The patient was 
started on empiric folate, thiamine, multivitamin. He was given 
lactulose 30mL TID, rifaximin 550mg BID with improvement of his 
confusion.  He verbalized understanding that he needs to take 
lactulose every day, multiple times per day, in order to clear 
his confusion.

# ELEVATED BUN with
# EPISTAXIS:
Mild, to 21, without elevation in creatinine.  Possibly due to 
ingested blood from nosebleed.  Resolved on its own with stable 
CBC.

# TRANSAMINITIS, AST > ALT:
Most concerning for alcohol intoxication, though elevated AST 
could also reflect muscle breakdown in setting of AMS/fall/being 
down for prolonged periods of time. Pt denies EtOH. Could also 
be drug effect from his antipsychotics (eg. quetiepine). No 
clear offender, but downtrending at time of discharge.

# COAGULOPATHY:
Mild, INR baseline 1.3-1.4.  Stable in setting of his liver 
disease. Trended on daily labs.

CHRONIC/STABLE ISSUES:
# HISTORY OF CIRRHOSIS:
-Volume:  Albumin was given PRN
-Infection:  No ascites to suggest SBP, other blood/urine
cultures without growth.
-Bleeding:  continued home propranolol
-Encephalopathy:  Lactulose TID and rifaximin 550mg BID.
-Screening:  Pt has known HCC (from HCV, previously treated with 
interrupted Harvoni but completed Epclusa/ribavirin on ___. 
He has undergone RFA of a segment IV lesion and L adrenal 
metastasis.  

# HISTORY OF METASTATIC HEPATOCELLULAR CARCINOMA:
Per last liver clinic note, the patient has a very poor 
prognosis given his multi-focal hepatocellular carcinoma.  He 
was deemed not likely to benefit from systemic chemotherapy 
given his overall poor functional status.  He had previously 
been referred to palliative and hospice care for support.  
Palliative care was consulted in house for symptom control, and 
an introduction to their service.  We are planning to schedule 
him an appointment soon to see the Palliative Care team to 
discuss symptom-focused care, as there is no other treatment 
available for his hepatocellular carcinoma.  The patient 
discussed this with our team and Palliative Care physicians; as 
of our final conversation, he was able to verbalize that there 
were no treatment options to reverse or cure his hepatocellular 
carcinoma.

#COPD: Home Breo was not available. Exchanged with 
fluticasone/salmeterol in-house, resumed breo at discharge.

#ADHD, Bipolar: continued home aripripazole, keppra, quetiepine

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ is a ___ YO male with a history of metastatic HCC 
without further treatment options, presenting as a transfer from 
___ after a 10 day ICU stay for further management of 
sepsis, renal failure on CRRT, liver failure, and concern for 
DIC. Despite aggressive care with antibiotics, stress dose 
steroids, pressors, and CRRT, he continued to decompensate. On 
___, he lost a pulse with daughter at bedside who declined CPR 
and he died. His family declined an autopsy.

#Shock 
#Klebsiella bacteremia
Overall picture most consistent with distributive shock, as he 
was warm and CVO2 was 80. Less like cardiogenic or obstructive. 
He did have a positive culture for Klebsiella, but has been on 
adequate treatment based on sensitivities. Concern for new 
resistant infection, potentially VAP vs GI source i/s/o liver 
failure. Also could be vasodilation from liver failure leading 
to distributive shock picture. Does have known mets to adrenal 
glands so adrenal insufficiency was also considered. He was 
initially broaded to vancomycin and cefepime and started on 
stress dose steroids. He was continued on levophed and 
vasopressin. On ___ in the AM, had increasing pressor 
requirement MAP and worsening lactate, so a ___ pressor was 
added. A TTE was done to look for signs of cariogenic shock, 
which showed RV dilation, with hyperdynamic LV, though concern 
for cariogenic shock as the major cause of decompensation 
remained low. His daughter and brother were called by palliative 
care to inform them of his worsening clinical status. His 
daughter arrived and was with him at bedside when he lost his 
pulse and who articulated as the alternative HCP in the setting 
of not being able to reach primary HCP that she did not want CPR 
performed. He died with his daughter at bedside and his brother 
arrived soon after. They declined an autopsy.

#Acute hypoxic respiratory failure
#ARDS
Intubated since ___ when presented with oxygen saturation of 
50%. Suspect multifactorial in the setting of volume overload 
from renal failure, pleural effusion, potential new VAP masked 
by effusion on imaging, and development of ARDS. Also could 
consider hemorrhage in the setting of DIC. Despite aggressive 
treatment with CRRT and multiple ventilator modalities, his 
condition progressed and he expired.
 
#Toxic metabolic encephalopathy
#Hx of seizure
Sedation initially weaned on arrival without return of active 
movement or response. Concern for worsening HE in the setting of 
new potential GI bleed and progressive liver failure. Could also 
consider seizure as he has a history of seizure disorder, though 
less likely with proprofol and Keppra. Also contributed to by 
worsening infection. Patient with high residuals so does not 
appear to be absorbing lactulose and not having bowel movements. 
He did not demonstrate signs of seizures and his mental status 
did not recover despite trials without sedation.

#Acute on chronic Liver failure 
#Metastatic HCC 
#Cirrhosis  
#hx of varices
#?GI bleed
Patient has advanced disease with known varices s/p TIPS, 
coagulopathy, pancytopenia, hepatic encephalopathy, and history 
of multifocal metastatic HCC with known metastases. No further 
treatment is available for his care.  He was maintained on 
octreotide and pantoprazole in case of variceal bleeding.

#Coagulopathy
#DIC vs liver failure

Patient presenting with small volume blood loss from rectum, 
foley, and epistaxis, in the setting of fibrinogen of 95 and 
elevated INR despite FFP administration, concerning for DIC. 
Also made worse by liver failure. He was given supportive care 
with cryo, FFP, platelets and PRBC.

#Acute renal failure
Suspect most likely secondary to septic shock and ATN without 
recovery of renal function. Could also be contributed to by 
intrinsic insults with contrast and antibiotic therapy. He was 
continued on CRRT.

Mr. ___, 
You came to us with blood in your stool. Our workup here shows 
you had a varix (exposed, bleeding vessel) in your stomach. You 
also had evidence of engorged vessels in your stomach and a 
varix in your esophagus. You blood levels were lower than 
baseline when you arrived because of the bleed; however, they 
are rising and stable at the time of discharge. Return to the ER 
immediately if you see any large bowel movement with bright red 
blood or black stool.
