History of Present Illness:
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: 
History was noted from Dr. ___ note from ___, and 
subsequent psychiatry CL notes in OMR, confirmed with patient 
and updated as relevant:

Briefly, patient is a ___ with past diagnosis of unspecified 
psychiatric disorder with psychiatric hospitalization in ___ 
and no known medical history who was BIBEMS after a friend 
called concerned for his safety.  Per review of records, the 
patient reportedly flew to ___ from ___ several 
days ago with the intention of staying with a friend, left the 
friend's home to purchase cold medicine, and never returned.  
When he was found by EMS he was noted to be altered and 
vomiting, thought to have intentionally ingested naproxen.

On interview, patient confirms that he did in fact travel from 
___ to ___ as he was being teased by colleagues at 
his place of work, employed as a ___ for a ___ 
affiliated with ___. He is vague yet concrete and unable to 
participate fully in interview, occasionally appearing 
distracted as though preoccupied by internal stimuli, requiring 
this interviewer to repeat her questions.  While initially 
stating that he did not feel threatened he later indicated that 
he had been followed and attacked by a group of "voices", one of 
which belonged to a man he noticed on the street.  He says that 
he went to the police to report that he was being "teased" and 
was, per him, told to fly to ___ to escape them.  He says 
that shortly after arriving in ___ he took "sleeping pills" 
with the intention of sleeping until they had ceased to pursue 
him; he denies suicidal ideation or past suicide attempts.  The 
patient states that this has been occurring for the last few 
months since he discontinued zyprexa, having been stabilized in 
___ at ___ following a similar situation.  He denies having 
experienced side effects on zyprexa though when pressed believes 
he gained weight.  He said that he discontinued the medication 
under the supervision of his then psychiatrist (does not recall 
her name) but noticed that these events began shortly after 
stopping the medication.  He endorses that zyprexa was 
previously beneficial in improving his "concentration", 
restoring his ability to "read and write", tasks with which he 
has difficulty now.
.
Notably, the patient believes he "was good- happy" until ___, 
shortly after arriving in the ___ to attend ___ in 
___.  He denies history of depressive or manic symptoms as 
well as anxiety though notes that he becomes very worried when 
"people stare at [him]", causing him to become frightened and 
"very angry", unsure of their intentions.  He initially endorses 
having harmed people but later denies physical assault.  He 
states that though his appetite has been normal he has not been 
able to sleep for the last four days due to fears that he was 
being followed (unable to clarify whether he is referring to his 
time before or in the hospital); he says that he currently feels 
safe given that the chip planted in his nose to feed information 
to these people has recently been disabled, they unaware of his 
location, though he does not know why these people would want to 
"see what [he] see[s]" or why they have targeted him.  The 
patient currently denies AVH but believes the voices belong to 
colleagues.

tachycardia from early on in his admission. He also had 
significant tachycardia while on the inpatient medicine floor 
which improved with 6L of IV fluids. Repeat EKG continued to 
showed sinus rhythm and CBC with a mild leukocytosis. A medicine 
consult was placed for further work-up. His leukocytosis 
resolved quickly without intervention and patient did not c/o of 
any specific symptoms concerning for infection. A CTA chest was 
performed which did not show any pulmonary embolus. He did have 
positive orthostatic tachycardia which responded to IV fluids. 
We continued to encourage PO fluids throughout remainder of 
admission.  

#Right shoulder weakness: Patient noted to have significant R 
shoulder weakness and limited range of motion on physical exam. 
Initial X-ray did not reveal in pathology but MRI right shoulder 
showed a pattern consistent with Parsonage-Turner Syndrome.  No

RISK ASSESSMENT & PROGNOSIS
On presentation, the patient was evaluated and felt to be at an 
increased risk of harm to self and/or others based upon ongoing 
symptoms of psychosis following an intentional overdose on 
ibuprofen.  Their static factors noted at that time include 
history of suicide attempts, chronic mental illness, male 
gender; the modifiable risk factors, including medication 
non-compliance, acute psychosis, lack of outpatient treaters, 
and lack of social supports were addressed at that time through 
reinitiation of psychotropic medications, coordination of 
aftercare, and involvement of friends and local supports in 
hospitalization and treatment. Finally, the patient is being 
discharged with many protective risk factors, including improved 
reality testing, resolved psychosis, resolved suicidal ideation, 
plan for ___ in ___ while staying with supportive 
family. Overall, based on the totality of our assessment at this 
time, the patient is not at an acutely elevated risk of 
self-harm nor danger to others.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ is a ___ y/o male with history of questionable 
schizophrenia and previous Benadryl overdose, who presented with 
AMS likely secondary to toxic ingestion. He initially required 
intubation given AMS and MICU admission. He was given 
intravenous fluids and monitored clinically and with serial 
EKGs.  

ACTIVE ISSUES:   
===============

# Encephalopathy:  
Presented by EMS after noted to be acting erratically and AMS. 
Highest concern for toxic ingestion, particularly given his 
possible previous overdose and acute change in mental status. 
Serum/urine tox and TCA screen negative. There was concern for 
overdose of naproxen given a receipt found on him or a cold 
medication given history provided but no other signs of 
anticholinergic toxicity such as urinary retention or flushing 
besides AMS and prolonged QTc in ED. Poison control was 
consulted and recommended continuing with conservative measures. 
He was also monitored with serial EKGs that showed a downtrended 
QTc from ~500s initially to <500. Differential also included 
infection with leukocytosis to 24 though there were no focal 
signs or symptoms and work up, including cultures and LP, was 
unremarkable. He received wide spectrum antibiotics and IV 
acyclovir for possible HSV encephalitis for 2 days before 
stopping given low clinical concern. EEG performed which did 
reveal possible focus of epileptiform activity but he couldn't 
tolerate leads so EEG was DCd and Neuro recommends no 
intervention. His mental status ultimately improved rapidly and 
he was extubated without issues. When he was more coherent he 
reports he is unable to remember what happened to bring him to 
the hospital. He denied any intentional overdose but did admit 
to taking 4 unisom pills has he hadn't slept for 3 days. 
Currently appears to be at baseline mental status.

# Possible Schizophrenia:
# Possible prior suicide attempt:
# Possible ingestion, presumed intentional
Appears to on initial reports to have a 2 week hospitalization 
requiring inpatient psych admission under similar circumstances 
at ___. Reportedly on Olanzapine but reports he has stopped 
taking it a few months, unclear how true this is.
Toxicology recommended conservative management for possible 
NSAID ingestion and has no further symptoms. He reports he took 
some unisom pills ~4 pills. Vitals and labs have since 
normalized so toxicology recommended against any further 
evaluation. Currently denies SI or previous SI. He does report 
hearing voices which he denies tells him to hurt himself or 
others but rather just speaks to others about what he does. He 
said he last heard the voices a few day prior to admission. He 
was evaluated by psychiatry who given admission circumstances 
were concerned for possible intentional overdose in suicide 
attempt. He was sectioned and monitored on 1:1 supervision. He 
was transferred to inpatient psychiatry. 

#Acute hypoxic respiratory failure
#Aspiration pneumonitis 
In the ED, patient vomited, likely aspirated, and then became 
hypoxic. Gastric secretions suctioned from oropharynx and OG 
tube. He was intubated given ongoing hypoxia and AMS. Follow up 
CXR was overall unremarkable. He was briefly treated with broad 
spectrum antibiotics for ~2 days before discontinuing due to low 
concern for true infection.  He was continued on a ventilator 
for ~36-48 hours before being extubated without issues. 
Currently saturating well on RA. 

#Lactic Acidosis
#Anion Gap Metabolic Acidosis 
#Leukocytosis
