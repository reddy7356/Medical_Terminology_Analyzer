Chief Complaint:
Hyperglycemia, Abdominal Pain

History of Present Illness:
This is a ___ year old lady wi with PMH of Type I DM and 
malignant melanoma who presented to the ED with hyperglycemia 
and abdominal pain.

She reports that when she awoke this morning she was not feeling 
her usual self and found her blood sugar to be in the mid ___. 
She took her insulin per her regular pump indications for 
sliding scale but on serial rechecks her BS were persistently in 
the 300s.  Over the course of the day she slowly developed 
epigastric abdominal pain associated w/ nausea and ultimately 
emesis.  She denied fevers, chills, cough, or diarrhea. 

In the ED, initial VS were:  98.0 ___ 18 98%.   Initial 
labs were significant for WBC 22.4, Hct 46, Cr 1.1, K+ 5.2, Hc03 
11, glucose of 547 and lactate of 4.4. In the setting of 
abdominal pain on exam and leukocytosis, a CT abdomen and pelvis 
was performed with contrast which ruled out on preliminary read 
an acute process. For her anion gap acidosis she was started on 
an insulin gtt for treatment of DKA and given IVF 4L NS and 
started on vancomycin and zosyn for her elevated lactate. A 
repeat lactate decreased to 3.0. An VBG 7.___. A chest xray 
was clear. Blood cultures were drawn. Vitals on transfer were.
  
On arrival to the MICU,  pt was stable with VS: 98.6 113 108/49 
100% RA 18.

Brief Hospital Course:
This is a ___ yo lady with PMH of Type I DM and malignant 
melanoma who presents with an anion gap acidemia in the setting 
of elevated lactate and glucose in addition to a leukocytosis of 
unclear source. 

# Metabolic Acidemia: Pt had AG metabolic acidosis upon arrival 
to MICU, most likely ___ to DKA considering history of 
uncontrolled blood glucose. AG metabolic acidosis could also be 
___ lactic acidosis given her elevated lactate of 4.4 (now 
downtrending to 3.0).  Her elevated lactate may be associated 
with pt's DKA or associated with potential toxic ingestion of 
salicylates (pt currently taking Aspirin).  Given that bicarb 
may worsen the hypokalemia and hyperosmolarity observed in DKA, 
bicarbonate was avoided in empiric treatment of lactic acidosis. 
 Patient's lactate stabilized during hospitalization. Repeat ABG 
showed resolution of acidemia.  Patient received aggressive 
fluid resuscitation with D5 NS + K.  Patient was restarted on 
insulin drip and converted to insulin sliding scale per 
recommendation from ___ Endocrinology.

# Hyperglycemia/Insulin Dependant Diabetes:  Pt had a blood 
glucose of 547 upon transfer to the MICU as well as an AG of 36. 
___ Endocrinology found that the patient's insulin pump was 
malfunctioning and the likely cause of this episode of DKA.

#Leukocytosis: The patient was admitted with an elevated WBC of 
22.4.  The patient had no clear source of infection (clinically 
afebrile with negative blood cultures and negative abdominal CT 
and CXR).  Leukocytosis was most likely in association with DKA. 
During the patient's hospitalization, her WBC downtrended.

#HYPERLIPIDEMIA: Patient was continued on home dose of 
simvastatin.

#HTN: Patient was continued on home moexipril.
