CT ABDOMEN:  The lung bases are clear.  The visualized portions 
of the heart
and pericardium are unremarkable.  Several subcentimeter 
hypodensities
throughout the liver are too small to characterize (2:10).  The 
hepatic and
portal veins are patent.  The gallbladder, spleen, adrenals, and 
pancreas are
normal.  The kidneys enhance symmetrically and excrete contrast 
without
evidence of hydronephrosis or mass.  The stomach and small bowel 
are
unremarkable.  There is no portacaval, mesenteric, or 
retroperitoneal
lymphadenopathy.  There is no free air or free fluid.
 
CT PELVIS:  The appendix is not visualized.  The colon, rectum, 
seminal
vesicles, prostate, and urinary bladder are normal.  There is no 
pelvic
lymphadenopathy or free fluid.
 
OSSEOUS STRUCTURES:  There is no lytic or blastic lesion 
worrisome for
malignancy.
IMPRESSION:  No acute intra-abdominal process.
.
RUQ U/S: 

FINDINGS:
The liver is diffusely echogenic.  No focal liver lesions are 
detected.  The
main portal vein is patent with hepatopetal flow.  The 
gallbladder is normal
without evidence of stones.  There is no intra or extrahepatic 
biliary ductal
dilation.  The pancreas is unremarkable.  The spleen is normal 
in size
measuring 9.7 cm.  Visualized portions of the aorta and inferior 
vena cava are
unremarkable.  Single image of the right kidney demonstrates no 
right
hydronephrosis.
 
IMPRESSION:
No acute findings.  Echogenic liver, consistent with fatty 
infiltration.
However, other forms of liver disease including more advanced 
liver disease
such as significant hepatic fibrosis/cirrhosis cannot be 
excluded on this
study. 
.
EGD:
Normal mucosa in the whole esophagus
There was moderate mucosal edema at the pylorus that may 
represent acid reflux disease. There was no cause for the 
hematemesis and anemia identified.
Normal mucosa in the whole duodenum
Otherwise normal EGD to third part of the duodenum
 
Brief Hospital Course:
The patient is a ___ year old male with a history of 
schizophrenia who presents from home after an episode of 
vomiting with red blood in it found to have a new microcytic 
anemia. 
.
#CONCERN FOR GI BLEED / MICROCYTIC ANEMIA:   The patient 
reported an episode of emesis with blood in it prompting him to 
seek medical care.  During the hospitalization he had no further 
emesis. He had two bowel movements - one of which was saved and 
was dark, but not frank melana, and guaiac positive. His 
hematocrit was noted to be lower than baseline (23.4) requiring 
transfusion of one unit of blood with appropriate response to 
28.  Review of recent lab work over the past several months 
shows a new microcytic anemia.  Iron studies suggest iron 
deficiency with a low ferritin (5).  He was seen by GI.  He 
underwent an EGD that showed normal mucosa but no source of 
bleeding.  In the setting of a one year history of intermittent 
abdominal discomfort and on-going outpatient GI evaluation, a CT 
abdomen was obtained that showed no acute intra-abdominal 
process.  Testing for celiac disease was negative.  Testing for 
stool H. pylori was ordered but not obtained.  He was started on 
a  PPI.  He was started on iron supplementation.  Given his 
clinical stability, care was coordinated with GI with plan for 
outpatient colonoscopy and possibly capsule endoscopy if 
negative.  
.
#SCHIZOPHRENIA:  He was continued on his home dose of Abilify 
although declined to take the medication for most of his 
hospitalization. Speaking with his parents, he typically will 
take the medication for several days and feel better but then 
stop the medication for several days.  He was concerned that the 
Abilify was contributing to his abdominal pain.   He was 
instructed to take the medication with food to reduce the 
possibility of GI side effects.  Per his parents, he has been 
seeing his outpatient psychiatrist for some time and they have 
tried multiple different psychiatric medications at different 
doses but the Abilify seems to work the best.  He was seen by 
psychiatry during the hospitalization.  
.
#NUTRITION:   He endorsed (parents confirmed) about a 10 pound 
weight loss over the past several months.   
This seems to be due to restrictive dieting as he reported 
limiting dietary options, partly out of concern that it may be 
something he is eating that is contributing to his intermittent 
abdominal discomfort and nausea. He met with nutrition and 
recommendations were provided regarding food selection/diet.  He 
also questioned whether anxiety could be causing his symptoms of 
intermittent abdominal discomfort, nausea and reduced appetite.  
He was seen by Psychiatry and is planning to follow up with his 
outpatient psychiatrist.  He had no nausea, vomiting, or 
abdominal pain with eating during the hospitalization.   
.
#FEVER:  A temperature of 101 was recorded in his chart.  The 
temperature returned to ___ without intervention.  He 
reported feeling in good health without signs/symptoms of 
infection.  He was instructed to continue to monitor for new 
symptoms and call his PCP should he be concerned about anything 
new after dsicharge.  

TRANSITIONAL: 
-hematocrit check at ___ on ___ 
-GI to call patient to schedule colonoscopy and consider capsule 
endoscopy for further evaluation of GI blood loss. He also has 
follow up with GI in several weeks. 
-would recommend outpatient follow up with nutrition if 
available through PCP office

History of Present Illness:
___ y/o M h/o schizoaffective d/o,
formerly followed by ___ outpt psych (terminated with Dr.
___ in ___, presenting BIB police after they 
were
called for him walking into a stranger's home. No other details
of his presentation are known and pt is unable to provide them.
He is found to be extremely guarded with severe thought disorder
(blocking, broadcasting) and likely AH as he is responding to
internal stimuli. He therefore is unwilling and unable to 
provide
proper history. He initially refused to give names of collateral
contacts but his father's phone number was found in ___ and he 
is
on the way to ED. Pt suggests there is nothing wrong with him 
and
responds "I'm not interested" to many questions. Acknowledged he
was feeling scared and that he had a headache, but these were to
my direct questioning and not spontaneously offered. He offers a
few full sentences (beyond "I'm not interested") and they are at
inappropriate times (i.e. when asked what hospital he was in).
Says, "I wasn't scared of the police" and later "They might have
been scared of me." Also said, "I like to ___ things." Other
interesting tidbits of information that he shared were, "I don't
want to be a victim," and "I was looking for someone else...
___  Unable to elaborate on any of these statments but did
said ___ was "not quite" a friend, and nodded when asked 
if
she was like a girlfriend. At one point, pt agreed to my
wondering if he felt like I was reading his mind, and said
"You're gifted."  Pt's seems to be looking for sig meaning in my
questions and often responds with "that's a stupid question" or
"These questions aren't challenging enough."  Is (barely) able 
to
acknowledge that his current thinking/communicating pattern
"isn't my style." At the ended of the interview his final
statement was, "I prefer 'two.' That's the answer."  

Parents reveal that they have been out of town for past 3 days 
at
a wedding and that pt has been cared for by his grandparents.
Report that he is typically medication non-compliant and that it
is a constant struggle to make him take his meds. He therefore
has been off meds for quite some time. They feel that he has 
been
deteriorating and are concerned about his presentation. They
would rather he be admitted now, as they fear they would not be
able to care for him at home and that he might "run off" again.
They are also intensely afraid of losing the patient's trust but
struggling with forcing him into treatment. (I.e. seeking
guardianship, filing for ___, etc.) They prefer he is 
admitted
to ___ or ___ and would rather take him home if he is
planned to be admitted elsewhere. They had just gotten home and
were ready to look for pt when I called them from the ED. They
say he typically wanders off and they find him in the ___.

Pertinent Results:
___: CBC wnl, BMP wnl, UA wnl, Utox neg, Stox neg

 
Brief Hospital Course:
Legal: ___
Medical: The patient was seen by Nutrition during his hospital 
day due to complaints of poor eating habits and desire for 
weight gain. He was maintained a kosher diet with Ensure 
supplements tid. Labs of BMP, CBC, TSH, Vit B12, Folate, 
pre-Albumin were noted to be wnl.   

Psychiatric: Upon admission, the patient exhibited severe speech 
disorganization, loosening of associations, and 
circumfrentiality on interview. He was very perservative on 
religious and philosophical issues. He was noted by nursing 
staff to be responding to internal stimuli and talking aloud 
through the unit. Initially, due to his disorganization and poor 
boundaries with other patients, particularly females, on the 
unit, thus he was initially placed on five minute checks. On 
admission, he was started on low dose Abilify 2.5 mg po daily, 
as Abilify itself was noted to be effective in the past. On 
Hospital Day two he exhibited more signs of withdrawal, 
posturing with minimal speech. Thus, Abilify was increased to 5 
mg po daily and he was additionally started on Ativan .5 mg po 
bid that was subsequently increased to 1 mg po bid. The first 
several days taking medications, the patient was very 
philosophical and questioning of medications, but was agreeable 
and compliant with medications when his questions were answered. 
He eventually became more organized in his thought process to 
sign into the hospital and was agreeable to treatment. With the 
slow titration of his Abilify medication to 20 mg po over the 
course of his hospitalization, the patient slowly showed great 
improvement in his level of organization, focus, and lack of 
internal preoccupation. He initially noted somnolence with his 
medication during the day, so his Abilify was changed to the 
evening. Ativan was subsequently decreased to 1 mg po qhs and as 
needed 
        His family, outpatient psychiatrist, and Rabbi were 
involved with his care and confirmed his large improvement with 
medication treatment and issues with compliance in the past. The 
patient continued to struggle with the balance of religion and 
mental illness, but continued to be compliant with medications 
during his hospitalization, referencing an agreement he made 
with his Rabbi to work with his providers and medications for at 
least a three month trial. As he improved on the unit, he was 
more interactive on the unit with other patients and was placed 
on 15 minute checks with no incident. He began attending both 
activity and psychiatry groups, with particular fondness towards 
___ groups. He interacted in groups and his peers 
appropriately. On discharge, the patient was scheduled to follow 
with his outpatient psychiatrist, ___ day program. In 
addition, an application for ___ services was submitted. A 
partial program was encourgaed for additional strucutre, but he 
and his family declined this for the time being because they 
___ be spending half of the week out of town at a ___ house 
for the summer. 
         Over the course of his admission much psychoeducation 
was given to the patient and his family over the concerning 
degree of his psychotic symptoms and his need for therapeutic 
medication trials through time. Discussion was had of the use of 
higher doses of medications, addition of mood stabilizers and 
even potentially injectable medications in the future if 
medication compliacne remained an issue. His parents are also 
aware of the option to apply for guardianship if the paitent 
continues to do poorly. However, this was not pursued at this 
time because the patient had never been compliant with a dose 
higer than 5mg of abilify, he had not had the benefit of DMH 
services, and has not been involved in mental health recovery 
programs outside of the hospital. He and his family understand 
the importance of having the patient return to the emergency 
room or the hospital if he decompensates outside of the 
hospital, stops his medications, or develops suicididal 
thougths. After he leaves the hospital he ___ be returning to 
live with his parents and he ___ continue to be involved in his 
___ community for extra support and strucutre. At the time of 
discharge, the patient no longer presented as an acute risk to 
himself or others, he was eating well, maintaining his ADLs 
well, demonstrated appropriate boundaries with other patients 
and staff, and appeared to be committed to taking his medication 
and following up as an outpatient. Prior authorization was 
obtained through medicare D for the next year for the use of 
abilify.
