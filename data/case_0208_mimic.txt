Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ is a ___ gentleman with history of CAD s/p 
CABG, AAA repair, and recent upper GI bleed secondary to a newly 
discovered gastric mass, who presented to ___ with one 
day of progressively worsening chest pain, found to have 
troponin elevation, and transferred to ___ for management of 
NSTEMI.

ACUTE ISSUES
============
#NSTEMI
Patient presented with chest pain relieved by SL nitro and found 
to have troponin T 0.9 on arrival to ___ ED. EKG was without 
signs of ischemia. Given recent GI bleed, initial concern was 
for acute blood loss, however patient was normotensive, 
asymptomatic, and H/H on admission appeared similar to if not 
elevated from H/H at discharge from ___ in late ___. 
Spoke extensively with patient and family regarding bleeding 
risk, and all agreed that benefit of anticoagulating for NSTEMI 
outweighed the risk of GI bleed. He was treated with heparin for 
48 hours, and started on daily aspirin 81mg, high-intensity 
statin, metoprolol, and a nitrate for cardioprotection. 

#Congestive Heart Failure with Reduced EF (40%)
Echo showed a reduced EF of 40%. Patient was not diuresed as he 
appeared euvolemic on exam, without dyspnea or supplemental O2 
requirement. He on metoprolol for beta-blockade. Defer starting 
___ pending recovery from acute kidney injury.

#Recent upper GI bleed
Patient admitted to ___ recently for UGIB, noted on mesenteric 
angiography on ___ to be related to irregular neovascularity 
of a gastric mass and a small pseudoaneurysm from a distal 
branch of the left gastric artery, which was embolized to good 
effect during that admission. He has had no signs of bleeding 
this admission. BID pantoprazole was continued.

#Gastric mass
"Large, fungating, infiltrative, sessile, submucosal and 
ulcerated, non-circumferential mass with no bleeding and 
stigmata of recent bleeding" was found on the lesser curvature 
of the stomach on EGD at ___ on EGD ___. Per the 
patient and his family, he has outpatient follow-up 

#Acute kidney injury
-Mild increase of Cr from 1.3 on admission to 1.6. No sign of 
obstruction on renal ultrasound. Patient had mild relative 
hypotension (SBP ___ which may have led to mild ATN, as 
patient's urine sodium was 58 and he did not develop oliguria. 
He will be discharged on lower doses of blood pressure 
medications and should have repeat chemistry panel checked as an 
outpatient.

CHRONIC ISSUES
==============
#Glaucoma:
Home dorzolamide/timolol and latanoprost were continued. 

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES
===================
[] Patient should have repeat chemistry panel to evaluate acute 
kidney injury at next PCP appointment schedule ___. 
[] Defer starting ACEi for HFrEF due to acute kidney injury. 
Please consider starting this medication pending stability of 
renal function and blood pressure.
[] Defer starting clopidogrel to outpatient cardiologist given 
recent GI bleed and ongoing GI oncologic evaluation
[] Follow up as planned prior to admission with outpatient GI 
for biopsy
[] Follow up as planned with hematology/oncology for possible 
radiation

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,

You were admitted to the hospital because you had chest pain. 
You were found to have had a heart attack. We did an ultrasound 
of your heart and saw that one area was moving slightly less 
than normal, which could be related to the heart attack. Because 
of this abnormality, your heart's pumping function is slightly 
reduced from normal. If you notice increased difficulty 
breathing or swelling in your legs, please see a medical 
professional as soon as you are able.

We treated your heart attack with heparin, a blood thinner, for 
48 hours. We also started several medications that help protect 
the heart muscle when someone has a heart attack, including 
Aspirin, atorvastatin, metoprolol, and isosorbide mononitrate 
(imdur). Because you recently had serious bleeding from your 
stomach, we held off on starting a medicine called Clopidogrel 
(Plavix), which we would also recommend you take when your GI 
doctors feel it is safe. 

WHAT DO YOU NEED TO DO WHEN YOU LEAVE THE HOSPITAL?  
- It is very important to take your aspirin every day
- Take all of your other heart medications as prescribed (listed 
below)
- Follow up with your doctors as listed below
- Seek medical attention if you have new or concerning symptoms 
or you develop chest pain, swelling in your legs, abdominal 
distention, or shortness of breath at night
 
It was a pleasure participating in your care. We wish you the 
best!  
-Your ___ Care Team  
 
Followup Instructions:
