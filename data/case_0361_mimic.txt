"""
On interview on the unit, patient states "I'm not evil. I'm not

here because her ___ was worried and wanted her to come in.  She 
states that recently, a dark-skinned girl has been entering her

she started to "mess around with my dude." She states that the 
girl participates in witchcraft and that she had to be more

work."

"there was a curse on my family in ___ and that her mother

you" while jealous. She says that many people have been jealous

and that she dresses well. She states that she never learned how 
to play but that her ability is "a gift from God." She 
repeatedly states "I serve God" and says that her faith 
(pentecostalism) is
very important to her, noting that her faith is her source of 
strength that has saved her from her prior "sinning" including 
smoking and dancing.

considered suing her. She states that recently she stopped

Brief Hospital Course:
1) LEGAL & SAFETY:  
Patient initially admitted on ___, and had since signed a 
conditional voluntary agreement (Section 10 & 11) and remained 
on that level throughout their admission. Patient maintained 
safety on 15 minute checks/green sharps and had maintained that 
level of observation throughout while being unit restricted. No 
chemical or physical restraints needed during admission. 
. 

2) PSYCHIATRIC:
Upon admission initially, patient was paranoid and guarded, and 
at first refused to consider signing legal paperwork as she 
believed "no one is gonna trick me" and that her psychiatrist 
"tricked [her] into signing the paper so she could have control 
over [her]". She stated that there was a woman who had been 
doing witchraft in her apartment (she believed this was her ex 
husband's mistress ___ who was trying to both poison her 
food, change around her ointments, write messages on the ground, 
and harm her cats to terrorize the patient.  She would often see 
___, hear her making noise in her home, but never heard her 
speak; she denied experiencing auditory hallucinations and did 
not appear internally preoccupied. Nevertheless, patient had 
poor insight into her psychotic illness given that she believed 
her ___ wanted her on an inpatient unit as a respite from her 
stressful situation at home. Otherwise patient had endorsed 
depressed mood and anxiety from her current situation, but 
denied any suicidal or homicidal ideation, intent, or plan with 
very future oriented, optimistic thinking with protective 
factors including family and religion. 
.
On initial exam, patient was guarded and then over course of 
interview was more comfortable and forthcoming. Her speech was 
non pressured with normal prosody, but patient was disorganized 
with both circumstantial and tangential thought process, with 
aforementioned delusions present along with hyperreligiosity. 
From prior history obtained from both OMR and collateral, 
patient had long history of medication non compliance and in 
this setting had multiple hospitalizations for suicidal ideation 
and persecutory delusions (per record, 4 hospitalizations in 
total most recent being at ___. She was prescribed 
multiple antipsychotics, all of which patient refused including 
most recently brexipiprazole (last filled ___. Inpatient 
psychiatric hospitalization was deemed necessary for diagnostic 
clarification, medication management, psychotherapeutic 
intervention, and collaboration with outpatient providers.
.
During hospital course, patient initially refused to take 
risperidone because "Dr. ___ not my doctor anymore, put 
me on that and I'm not supposed to be on that". However, she 
agreed to try paliperidone instead and was initially started on 
paliperidone 3 mg QHS and continued on both Duloxetine 60 mg PO 
for depression and Hydroxyzine 25 mg QHS PRN for insomnia. PRNs 
for anxiety/agitation included risperidone 0.5 mg BID PRN and 
lorazepam 0.5 mg BID PRN, although patient was not agitated 
during hospital course. While in hospital, patient socialized 
with other patients, was friendly/cooperative with both staff 
and other patients, felt safe on unit and noted that her mood 
was "pretty good" overall. However, after patient continued to 
endorse feeling worried about "my ex boyriend's mistress 
performing witch craft.... who know's what she's been doing up 
there", and talking in detail about how "the woman looks just 
like you and me but sometimes appears in the form of a voodoo 
spirit", patient was titrated upwards to paliperidone 6 mg 
QHS---> 9 mg QHS. Patient was agreeable to trying long acting 
injectable and was started on Invega sustenna IM 234 mg, 
followed by 156 mg on ___. Patient appeared to be tolerating 
Invega sustenna with no reported side effects, and was agreeable 
to continue to take her medication in outpatient setting as long 
as she could establish a successful therapeutic alliance with a 
psychiatrist.  During family meeting with patient's ___, 
daughter in law, and cousin, patient's family was deeply 
concerned for patient's safety given recent bizarre behavior, 
poor PO intake, hyperreligiosity, poor control over finances, 
with apparent functional decline. Patient's family felt patient 
had improved substantially from initial presentation, but felt 
patient was still not at baseline and needed to be further 
stabilized prior to discharge. 
.
Patient throughout weekend believed that she would be discharged 
on ___ or ___ after injection, and when patient was not 
discharged home, patient was extremely upset. She refused to get 
2nd dose of Invega unless she had official legal documentation 
stating that she would be discharged. Patient appeared paranoid 
regarding her medications, asking why she got different colors 
for her B12 pill. She felt the staff at ___ was untrustworthy 
given that she felt "lied to" and held in the inpatient unit 
without reason. This was the first time patient was particularly 
upset with primary treatment team and was indicative of 
patient's limited insight into her psychiatric illness. She 
additionally verbalized paranoia regarding night time nursing 
staff, particularly stating that the nurse was "evil" and that 
she could "sense it". Patient signed 3 day notice on ___ 
after hearing she would not be discharged on ___. 
. 
Diagnostically, patient's presentation appeared consistent with 
a ___ psychotic disorder or paraphrenia. The 
differential included primary psychotic disorder, or more likely 
an affective psychosis given her mood symptoms of stated 
depression and irritability alongside decreased need for sleep. 
Per collateral from Dr. ___ additionally had hx of 
prior episodes consistent with mania and major depression, which 
further supported the notion that patient has schizoaffective 
disorder, bipolar type. 
.
On discharge patient was slightly irritable given that she was 
upset for having to leave later than expected, but denied 
depressed mood, SI/HI, AVH, and did not appear to be internally 
preoccupied. Patient was exhibiting paranoid behavior given her 
distrust of medical team, but appeared less paranoid and more 
calm today compared to yesterday. Nevertheless, patient over 
last week exhibited overall improvement in mental status, with 
notable decrease in preoccupation with paranoid delusions 
(though still present). Patient had notable improved PO intake, 
was social with peers, and was successfully titrated on Invega 
Sustenna with 2nd dose given ___. 
.

Paliperidone-
I discussed the indications for, intended benefits of, and 
possible side effects and risks of this medication, and risks 
and benefits of possible alternatives, including not taking the 
medication, with this patient.  We discussed the patient's right 
to decide whether to take this medication as well as the 
importance of the patient's actively participating in the 
treatment and discussing any questions about medications with 
the treatment team, and I answered the patient's questions.  
.
RISK ASSESSMENT & PROGNOSIS
On presentation, the patient was evaluated and felt to be at an 
increased risk of harm to herself based upon patient's poor 
insight, disruptive behavior within the community (frequent 
calls to police, spoke to neighbors about seeing ex boyfriend's 
mistress in home) and poor PO intake due to paranoia. Patient 
had prior hx of multiple hospitalizations and chronic mental 
illness, with hx of abuse (physical, sexual, emotional), 
comorbid chronic health conditions, with history of medical 
noncompliance in setting where patient was living alone. 
However, patient has many protective factors including positive 
social and family support, spirituality, sense of responsibility 
to self/family/pets, and no access to lethal weapon/means, with 
recently improved insight and medication compliance given 
patient's willingness to take invega sustenna. Overall, the 
patient is not at an acutely elevated risk of self-harm nor 
danger to others due to acutely decompensated psychiatric 
illness.
