History of Present Illness:
Mrs. ___ is an ___ year old female with COPD, HTN, who
presented to ___ from pulmonary rehab in hypertensive
urgency with bp 190s/80s and EKG showing ST elevation in V2/3.
She was placed on heparin and Ticagrelor and taken to cath lab
where prior LAD stent patent had stenosis proximally, and had a
"95% agonal lesion and a 60% lesion in the LAD with a 70% 
lateral
circumflex lesion and 95% obtuse marginal with a 60% right
coronary lesion." No interventions were performed. She had an
subsequent ECHO which showed EF 55%. She was subsequently
transferred to the ICU. The following day, she was noted to be
confused and unable to follow directions. Stat CT did not show
any acute changes, however a subsequent MRI showed acute infarct
involving L parietal, posterior temporal, and occipital lobes 
and
additional old lacunar infarcts in the left basal ganglia. She
otherwise remained hemodynamically stable. She was placed on
aspirin, Plavix, statin, beta-blocker and underwent neurology
evaluation. CTA of the neck showed > 90% stenosis of the 
proximal
left ICA and vascular surgery consult by Dr. ___ at ___
recommended transfer to ___ for consideration of carotid 
stent.

She currently feels well without any shortness of breath, chest
pain, fever, chills, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, 
headaches,
or changes in vision. She does not note any weakness or deficits
in sensation.

OSH IMAGING:
============
___: Critical high grade stenosis in the proximal left
internal carotid artery. No intracranial stenosis identified. 

Cardiac PCI ___: LMCA 95%, mid RCA 60%, mid CX 70%, ___ Ob
Marg 95% stenosis. 

TTE ___: LVEF 55%, no significant LVH, no diagnostic
findings of Takotsubo, mild valve abnormalities.

MRI brain: acute infarct involving portions of the left 
parietal,
posterior temporal, and occipital lobes. Old lacunar infarcts in
the left basal ganglia. No acute intracranial hemorrhage.

Carotid US ___: R ___ stenosis of right ICA, left 
carotid
___ stenosis of the left ICA. Moderately increased peak
systolic velocities at the proximal left ICA of 249 cm/s and 
with
end diastolic vel of 63 cm/s, consistent with stenosis of 
50-59%.
There is antegrade vertebral flow on the left side.

___ IMAGING:
=============

+ ECG Study Date of ___  1:24:50 AM 
 

Sinus rhythm. Anterolateral T wave inversions which may be 
consistent with 
Wellens sign for anterior myocardial infarction versus cerebral 
T waves. 
Clinical correlation is suggested. Compared to the previous 
tracing of ___ these T wave inversions are new. 

  Intervals     Axes 
Rate PR QRS QT QTc (___)    P QRS T 
62 ___ 397   90 8 156 
 

+ ___ Imaging CHEST (PORTABLE AP) 
IMPRESSION:  
  
In comparison with the study of ___ from an outside 
facility,, there again is substantial enlargement of the cardiac 
silhouette with mild elevation of pulmonary venous pressure.  
Retrocardiac opacification with blunting the costophrenic angle 
is consistent with pleural effusion and substantial volume loss 
in the left lower lobe.  Less prominent changes are seen at the 
right base. 
There is an area of increased opacification in the left mid 
zone.  This could well represent either atelectasis or fluid 
within an accessory fissure.  In  the appropriate clinical 
setting, superimposed pneumonia would be difficult to 
unequivocally exclude, especially in the absence of a lateral 
view. 

+ ___ Cardiovascular ECHO 
Conclusions   
The left atrium is normal in size. There is mild symmetric left 
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is 
normal. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion 
abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Overall left ventricular 
systolic function is normal (LVEF = 65%). Right ventricular 
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. There are focal 
calcifications in the aortic arch. The aortic valve leaflets (3) 
are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Trace 
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are 
mildly thickened. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. The 
tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. The pulmonary 
artery systolic pressure could not be determined. There is no 
pericardial effusion.   

+ ___ Imaging CHEST (PORTABLE AP) 
IMPRESSION:  
  
Comparison to ___.  Stable elevation of the left 
hemidiaphragm.  
Stable areas of local atelectasis.  Stable scarring at the right 
lung apex.  Unchanged areas of atelectasis at the right lung 
basis.  Old healed rib fractures.  Moderate cardiomegaly.  No 
new focal parenchymalopacities. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. ___ is a ___ with COPD, multivessel CAD and STEMI s/p 
LHC on ___ c/b embolic stroke, transferred from ___ 
for evaluation of L ICA stenosis.

# Left internal carotid artery stenosis: 
Patient transferred initially to vascular service, but repeat 
read of imaging showed 50-60% stenosis and thus likely etiology 
of stroke was thought to be from emboli from calcified aorta 
during LHC. No interventions per vascular surgery were 
performed. Patient was transferred to medicine service due to 
other comorbidities.

# Hypoxemia: 
Improved with nebs, pointing to COPD as the primary etiology. 
Possible contribution from atelectasis. No volume overload on 
exam or repeat CXR. No chest pain or ECG changes to suggest new 
cardiac ischemia (deep TWI in V2-V5 c/w recent STEMI, stable 
from prior). At risk for PE given COPD but workup deferred given 
rapid improvement with nebs. Discharged at baseline home O2 
requirement ___ NC during sleep).

# Embolic left temporal temporal/parietal/occipital stroke: 
Patient was found to be acutely aphasic post cath at 
___. MRI showed acute infarct involving left parietal, 
posterior temporal, and occipital lobes with old lacunar 
infarcts in left basal ganglia. At ___, Neuro was consulted 
and felt most likely etiology was embolization from calcified 
aorta during LHC rather than L ICA stenosis. TTE found apical 
hypokinesis but no aneurysm or thrombus. Patient was treated 
with aspirin, clopidogrel, and atorvastatin 80mg (substituted 
for prior simvastatin). She was evaluated by ___ who 
recommended discharge to ___ with ongoing cognitive/language 
therapy. At discharge, patient continued to be oriented to 
person only and inattentive.

# STEMI
# 3vCAD
Patient had STEMI at ___ on ___ ___levations in 
V2-V5. Cath showed multivessel disease, no intervention 
performed. CABG not consistent with goals of care per HCP. TTE 
___ showed EF 65%. Treated with aspirin/clopidogrel and 
carvedilol 3.125. ACEi was not initiated due to concern for 
cerebral hypoperfusion ___ carotid stenosis. No chest pain or 
ECG changes to suggest ongoing ischemia (repeat ECGs with stable 
deep TWI in V2-V5 c/w recent STEMI).

# HTN
Patient presented to ___ with hypertensive emergency in 
setting of STEMI. Given recent CVA and ICA stenosis, was managed 
conservatively at ___ with carvedilol 3.125, with SBPs 
110s-130s. 

#Normal/macrocytic anemia (MCV 96)
Unclear baseline. Hgb stable around 11 this admission. Retics 
and iron studies c/w chronic inflammation. B12 normal

#Elevated TSH
No history of thyroid disease. TSH likely elevated in setting of 
recovery from multiple illnesses and long hospitalization. 
Consider repeat TSH and T4 as an outpatient.

#Nutrition
Cleared for regular diet by Speech/Swallow.  

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
====================
- New meds: atorvastatin 80 mg daily (replacing simvastatin), 
clopidogrel 75 mg daily, carvedilol 3.125 mg BID
- Previously on lisinopril 10mg but held for borderline soft BPs 
(110s) given carotid stenosis and recent CVA; consider starting 
if BP tolerates
- Speech and swallow recommendations:
1.) PO diet: thin liquids, regular solids
2.) PO meds: whole, one at a time with thin liquids
3.) BID oral care
4.) Aspiration precautions:
    - needs assistance with tray set up
    - ensure pt fully upright at 90 degrees
5.) Full cognitive-language evaluation and therapy at rehab
facility.
- Please titrate COPD medications as clinically indicated
- Patient discharged with home O2 requirement ___ NC during 
sleep)
- Patient should follow up with cardiology, neurology, and 
pulmonary

Discharge Instructions:
Mrs. ___,

___ were referred to ___ for surgical evaluation by Vascular 
Services after a diagnostic workup at ___ found that ___ 
have a narrowed carotid artery (neck artery). This workup was 
done as a result of your admission to ___ with very high 
blood pressure, where the medical team discovered that ___ had 
suffered a heart attack requiring cardiac intervention in the 
catheter lab. After the intervention ___ were found to have 
difficulty expressing yourself and confusion. Brain imaging 
showed signs consistent with a stroke and an ultrasound of your 
neck blood vessels found the narrowed arteries.

We engaged the expertise of neurologists and cardiologists who 
found ___ to be at a very high risk for cardiac complications or 
a stroke if ___ were to have an operation at this time. It is 
recommended that ___ continue to recover from your stroke and 
heart attack at a rehabilitation facility that will assist ___ 
in regaining your strength and function.  

Thank ___ for allowing us to participate in your care!
