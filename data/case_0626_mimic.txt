was feeling well and was interactive with family. She fell today 
at rehab and was found to have BRBPR.  She was brought to an OSH 
and found to have free air under her diaphragm on a plain film. 
She was transferred to ___ for further management of a 
presumed perforated bowel.  Upon arrival to the ED she initially 
hypotensive. She underwent right IJ central line placement for 
initiation of pressors, fluids and antibiotics.  She underwent a 
CT abdomen and pelvis which confirmed the finding of a bowel 
perforation with peritonitis.  She was evaluated by surgery who 
discussed with her family what a poor surgical candidate she 
was. After reviewing the options available, the family opted to

Pertinent Results:
CT ABD/PELVIS ___:

1. Pneumoperitoneum. Given the distribution favoring the upper 
abdomen and 
slightly more prominent focus of air around the duodenal bulb, 
findings may represent a perforated duodenal ulcer. Clinical 
correlation is recommended. Evaluation is limited due to lack of 
oral and IV contrast. 
  
2. Colonic diverticulosis with no definite diverticulitis. 
  
3. Multilevel compression fractures of the thoracolumbar spine 
are 
age-indeterminate. 
  
4. Bilateral simple pleural effusions with adjacent associated 
atelectasis, 
are small. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ was a ___ year-old lady with history of dementia, 
recent recurrent pneumonias and C. diff infection who presented 
after a mechanical fall, complaining of ___ abdominal pain, 
found to have free air in abdomen. Her CT imaging in the ED was 
consistent with bowel perforation so general surgery was 
emergently consulted. The surgical team discussed with her 
family that the patient was a poor surgical candidate given age, 
multiple comorbidities and risks of this type of emergent 
procedure. After reviewing the options available, the family 
opted to make the patient CMO. She was initially given morphine 
which was inadequate for pain control and she was given several 
doses of hydromorphone with adequate result and was transferred 
to the medical floor for continued comfort care. On the medical 
floor, a meeting was held at the bedside with medical team and 
numerous family members including HCP ___.  The family 
expressed wishes to make the patient comfortable and requested 
pastoral care. Catholic priest and family's vicar came to speak 
w/ family and pt was placed on dilaudid drip as morphine did not

controlled. Pt arrived to the medical floor from ED around 7:30 
___ and time of death was 9:51 ___.
