improved with a baseline CT. No evidence of acute infarct. 

Carotid US from ___ ___:
IMPRESSION: No hemodynamic stenosis. 

CXR from ___ ___:
IMPRESSION: Left density most consistent with subsegmental 
atelectasis 

MRI brain with and without contrast ___:
IMPRESSION: Pending from ___ and pending in-house read.

NEUROPHYSIOLOGY
================
CONTINUOUS EEG (___): The background activity is 
asymmetric. During wakefulness, a slightly disorganized alpha 
frequency posterior dominant rhythm is seen, reaching up to a 
maximum of 8.5 Hz posteriorly, best seen on the right the left 
hemisphere shows continuous mixed theta and delta frequency 
slowing throughout the recording, maximal in the left temporal 
region. Frequent epileptiform discharges are seen in the left 
mid to posterior temporal region, phase reversing at T3, and T5. 
Additional epileptiform discharges are also seen in the left 
occipital region, at P3 and 01. There are frequent paroxysmal 
bursts of generalized, frontally maximal, rhythmic 2 Hz delta 
activity without clear evolution throughout the recording. 
  
SLEEP: The patient progresses from wakefulness to drowsiness, 
but normal transitions between various stages of sleep are not 
seen. 
  
PUSHBUTTON ACTIVATIONS: There are no pushbutton activations. 
  
SPIKE DETECTION PROGRAMS: There are numerous automated spike 
detections, predominantly for the left temporal epileptiform 
discharges as well as occasional left occipital discharges as 
described above. Other entries reflect electrode and movement 
artifact. 
  
SEIZURE DETECTION PROGRAMS: There are numerous automated seizure 
detections, predominantly for electrode and movement artifact. 
However, there is a 2 minute long seizure from 6:28:35 - 6:30:17 
am which arises out of sleep and begins in the left posterior 
quadrant, at P3 01 with initially low amplitude sharp theta 
frequency activity which evolves into 1. ___ Hz sharp wave 
discharges for a few seconds followed by sudden cessation of 
discharges for 2 seconds after which medium to high amplitude 
spike and wave and polyspike and wave discharges are seen again 
with highest amplitude at P3 and 01 region. This activity 
evolves further into higher amplitude ___ Hz polyspike 
discharges with spread diffusely into the left hemisphere, and a 
field extending into the right hemisphere. The seizure 
eventually and electrographically at 06:30:17. On video, the 
patient is asleep, and approximately 4 seconds before the 
electrographic onset of the seizure, the patient opens his eyes, 
stares ahead, and then closes his eyes midway through the 
electrographic seizure, without any other obvious clinical 
accompaniment. 
  
QUANTITATIVE EEG: Trend analysis is performed with Persyst Magic 
Marker software. Panels include automated seizure detection, 
rhythmic run detection and display, color spectral density 
array, absolute and relative asymmetry indices, asymmetry 
spectrogram, amplitude integrated EEG, burst suppression ratio, 
envelope trend, and alpha delta ratios. Segments showing 
abnormal trends are reviewed, and show the finding as described 
above. 
  
CARDIAC MONITOR: Shows a generally regular rhythm with an 
average rate of 80-90 bpm. 
  
IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal continuous ICU monitoring study 
because of a single 2 minute electrographic seizure with onset 
in the left parietal occipital region, arising out of sleep and 
associated with awakening and brief staring. Interictally, 
frequent epileptiform discharges are seen in the left mid to 
posterior temporal region as well as the left parieto-occipital 
region, indicative of 2 independent areas of potentially 
epileptogenic cortex. Throughout the recording, continuous mixed 
theta and delta frequency slowing is seen diffusely over the 
left hemisphere indicative of structural lesion causing focal 
cerebral dysfunction in this region. There are frequent 
paroxysmal bursts of generalized, frontally maximal 2 Hz 
rhythmic delta activity, indicative of deep midline subcortical 
dysfunction. The background over the right hemisphere 
demonstrates mild disorganization but does reach a  maximum of 
8.5 Hz during wakefulness.

Brief Hospital Course:
___ is a ___ year-old male with a left occipital grade II 
meningioma s/p partial resection, radiation and cyberknife who 
presented to ___ with confusion and worsening gait 
instability, was transferred to ___ for further evaluation.

1. Altered Mental Status/Gait Instability: Patient has new onset 
confusion and worsening gait instability since ___, 
seemingly precipitated by a fall, per his wife. AMS attributed 
to seizures iso meningioma, noted on EEG and pt was started on 
keppra. WHe was suspected to have continued intermittent 
seizures clinically and valproate was added. Toxic metabolic, 
thromboembolic (OSH carotid ultrasound negative), infectious 
causes ruled out (CXR, CT Chest, blood and urine cultures 
negative). MRI brain shows no evidence of stroke or change in 
existing meningioma. B12 slightly low and TSH was normal. 
Patient was started on dexamethasone for presumed edema in 
setting of recent SRS. Mental status was continuously improving 
at time of discharge. It was also suspected that patient may 
have some underlying cognitive impairment.

2. Urinary Retention. Patient was having some urinary retention 
iso leukocytosis and confusion and so was started on macrobid, 
to complete 8 day course (last day ___. Of note, urine 
culture was negative, but this was collected after antibiotic 
therapy was initiated. 

3. Meningioma: Patient has known left occipital grade II 
meningioma s/p partial resection, radiation and s/p cyberknife 
therapy from ___ to ___, with documented normal 
neurological examination as recently as ___.  Brain MRI at 
OSH shows no interval change. 
- Work up as above 

4. Obstructive Sleep Apnea: Per patient's family, he has a 
history of obstructive sleep apnea, but refuses to use CPAP at 
home. Consider that hypoxia secondary to OSA could have 
triggered seizure. Have consulted for inpatient CPAP. Recommend 
outpatient sleep study following discharge.

5 Diabetes Mellitus: HbA1c 6.5 on ___. On Lantus 10units 
QAM, and insulin sliding scale while in the hospital.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES
===================
- last day macrobid ___
- will need insulin teaching if going home on steroids
- started on B12 repletion, please recheck as outpatient
- continued neuro follow up as likely has previously 
unrecognized dementia
- started on keppra and divalproex as inpatient please consider 
tapering off keppra as outpatient if pt continues to be seizure 
free
- Has OSA, refused CPAP while inpatient. Recommend sleep study, 
and CPAP usage if pt is agreeable

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,

It was a pleasure to be part of your care. 

You were admitted to the hospital with worsening confusion and 
gait instability after having recently fallen. You were found to 
be having seizures and were started on two anti-seizure 
medications (keppra and valproate). These seizures are likely 
due to your brain tumor. You were started on a steroid 
medication to reduce any swelling in the brain. 

You were also diagnosed with a urinary tract infection while in 
the hospital and treated with an antibiotic called (macrobid), 
your last dose is today ___.

We also recommend that you have a sleep study once you get back 
home and on your feet to get a CPAP machine.

If you experience any worsening confusion or new seizures which 
might appear as loss of consciousness, eye rolling, etc please 
contact your doctor. 

We wish you the best,
Your ___ Team

Service: NEUROSURGERY
 
Allergies: 
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs
 
Attending: ___.
 
Chief Complaint:
This patient presented with what he described as weakness in his 
legs and headaches.
 
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
left craniotomy for tumor resection ___

 
History of Present Illness:
This patient presented with what he described as weakness in his 
legs and headaches. The MRI scan showed a homogeneously 
enhancing lesion in the left parietal lobe para medially which 
completely occluded the sagittal sinus. There
is very little para focal edema. The tumor has a maximum 
diameter of 3.4 cm already. The situation was discussed with him 
and clearly primary radiosurgery is inappropriate due to the 
size of the tumor. Also wait and see strategy given the size and 
the inhomogeneity of the contrast enhancement, which was 
suspicious for atypical features was not advisable.  Mr. ___ 
opted for an at least partial resection to obtain histological 
diagnosis and provide conditions that make radiosurgery of the 
tumor parts and the sinus a possibility.

 
Past Medical History:
unknown
 
Social History:
___
Family History:
non-contributory
 
Physical Exam:
Exam upon discharge:
The patient was oriented x 3. PERRL, EOMs intact. Face 
symmetric, tongue midline. He was moving all 4 extremities 
spontaneously and was walking on his own. His sensation was 
intact. No pronator drift.

 
Pertinent Results:
Post-op MRI ___:
FINDINGS: Postoperative changes are seen in the area of 
partially resected
meningioma in the high left occipital lobe adjacent to the 
sagittal sinus.
There are small foci of blood products in the operative bed, and 
a tiny amount of left subdural blood. Some residual enhancing 
mass remains adjacent to the superior sagittal sinus.
 
Signal change within the sinus itself is not significantly 
changed from prior exam, allowing for technical factors. There 
is high signal on T2W images within the portions of the sagittal 
sinus inferior to the resection site suggestive of slow flow, 
but normal enhancement within these areas on post-contrast 
images, and no increased signal on precontrast T1W images to 
suggest thrombus.
 
Ventricular size and configuration is unchanged. There is no 
evidence of
acute ischemia. Mildly restricted diffusion signal at the 
operative bed is
compatible with postsurgical change. Old infarct in the 
brainstem is
unchanged.
 
IMPRESSION:
1. Postoperative change at the site of recently resected 
meningioma, with
some residual enhancing tumor, and unchanged signal abnormality 
within the
adjacent superior sagittal sinus which may represent tumoral 
invasion or
thrombus. CTV or phase-contrast MRV could be performed to 
further evaluate
this area if clinically indicated.
2. Findings most consistent with slow flow within the sagittal 
sinus inferior to the resection site. No additional evidence of 
sinus thrombosis.
3. No evidence of acute infarction.

CT Head ___:
FINDINGS: High left parietal meningioma has been resected via 
left parietal
craniotomy. Expected postsurgical change is seen in the 
resection bed. There is no sign of large intracranial 
hemorrhage. Moderate amount of
pneumocephalus is present. There is no sign of mass effect, or 
vascular
territorial infarction. Ventricles and sulci are unchanged in 
size and
configuration, allowing for differences in modality.
 
IMPRESSION: Expected post-surgical change status post resection 
of left
parietal meningioma. No large intracranial hemorrhage.
 
Pathology: pending at time of discharge but the frozen section 
showed meningioma with atypical features
 
Brief Hospital Course:
The patient underwent elective craniotomy for tumor resection on 
___. The surgery went well. He did require intra-operative 
platelets due to some bleeding. He had previously been on 
aspirin but discontinued it 10 days before the surgery. The 
patient went to the ICU post-operatively. His CT scan showed no 
large hemorrhage with expected post-surgical changes in the 
operative bed. The MRI showed some residual tumor as well as 
some blood in the surgical bed and small amount of SDH. 
Neurologically the patient was doing very well. He was 
transferred to the floor on ___. The patient was evaluated by 
___ and was deemed safe to be discharged with his family. He was 
ambulating, voiding, and taking in food without difficulty. He 
was discharged on ___.

History of Present Illness:
___ M w/ PMH meningioma s/p partial resection, radiation, 
cyberknife, also w/ DM, HTN, HLD, who presents with possible 
unwitnessed fall. 
 
 Patient lives in ___ in ___. He was found by rehab 
facility staff this am on bed with lacerations to his head/ear, 
and blood on pillow and coffee table. Suspicion for fall with 
subsequent return to bed. Unfortunately, pt is unable to provide 
hx as he cannot remember last night's events. Unclear if syncope 
vs seizure. He was initially taken to OSH where CT Head and 
C-spine were negative for acute process/fracture and he was then 
transferred here for further management/evaluation.  
 Neuro H/P provided good historical background: "The patient has 
been in a rehab facility since his recent admission in ___ 
to Neuro-Oncology for an episode of confusion and gait 
instability. He was found to have seizures on EEG and started on 
AED regimen, which was ultimately titrated to keppra 750mg TID 
and divalproex ___ BID. He was discharged to rehab afterwards. 
AED levels in ___ were keppra 55 and valproate 87. On 
reevaluation in brain tumor clinic on ___, he was noted to 
have memory deficits, inattention, and was found to have a MOCA 
score of ___. Plan had been to arrange for outpatient LP to 
evaluate for presence of tauopathy for workup of dementia. He 
has remained in rehab since then. This morning, on staff rounds, 
he was found in his bed with significant bleeding from 
lacerations to his right ear and temporal region, as well as 
blood on his pillow and coffee table. The staff suspected a fall 
in the night with subsequent return to bed. They called for EMS 
who arrived and initially brought him to ___, where he 
was subsequently transferred to ___. Here, he was seen by 
Plastic surgery who repaired his right ear avulsion. Neurology 
was consulted for assistance in determining the etiology of his 
episode this morning."

MICROBIOLOGY
___ Urine Culture
URINE CULTURE (Final ___:    NO GROWTH. 

IMAGING
___ EEG
IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal continuous ICU EEG monitoring 
study because of a slower than average but well organized 
background; this pattern is consistent with a mild 
encephalopathy of toxic, metabolic, or anoxic etiologies. 
Interim findings were relayed to the clinical team periodically 
during this recording period.

___ Rib Unilateral (No CXR)
IMPRESSION: 
Left sixth rib fracture.  Possible seventh rib fracture also on 
the left. Pleural or extrapleural thickening appears similar to 
previous radiographs, and there is a small left pleural 
effusion.

___ CXR
IMPRESSION: 
No consolidation or acute cardiopulmonary process.  Improved 
mediastinal widening compared to ___.  Previous left 
seventh rib fracture noted.

___ EEG
IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal continuous ICU EEG monitoring 
study because of a slower than average but well organized 
background; this pattern is consistent with a mild 
encephalopathy of toxic, metabolic, or anoxic etiologies. No 
evidence of ongoing or potential epileptogenesis was seen during 
this recording period. 

___ MRI Head W/ or W/O Contrast
IMPRESSION:
1. Stepwise interval increase in size of a 2.6 x 2.2 x 2.6 cm 
residual left occipital parasagittal meningioma.  This mass 
continues to invade into the adjacent superior sagittal sinus 
with possible occlusion.
2. Interval development of a thin left occipital subdural 
collection as well as a thin rim of perilesional fluid with 
questionable associated increased susceptibility artifact, and 
is suspicious for interval development of small subdural 
hematoma and perilesional hemorrhage.
3. Focus of cortical enhancement inferior to the meningioma that 
may represent a small area of infarction or radiation necrosis.

 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ M w/ PMH meningioma s/p partial resection, radiation, 
cyberknife, also w/ DM, HTN, HLD, with recent admission to ___ 
(___) for altered mental status/ataxia in setting of 
multiple falls presenting with unwitnessed fall. 

#Unwitnessed fall: ___ AM He was found in bed with bloody ear 
presumed to have unwitnessed fall. In OSH ED, cleared CT head 
and CT spine cleared. He was transferred to ___ since his 
neurooncology care is here. Admitted to medicine to determine 
etiology of fall: mechanical vs. seizure vs. syncope. Neurology 
evaluated in the ED, considered AMS as a sign of cognitive 
decline documented in outpatient notes, prolonged post-ictal 
state or even NCSE. 24 hour EEG showed no evidence of 
epileptiform discharges and he does not have an increased 
tendency towards seizure over and above what his Keppra is 
already treating. He was continued on Keppra 750 mg PO TID, 
Divalproex ___ mg PO BID, dexamethasone 4 mg PO, Vitamin B12 and 
Thiamine. His cardiology work up was negative, with no 
arrhythmias on telemetry, negative orthastatics and trop 
negative x1 with no ischemic changes on EKG. Low concern for 
infectious induced toxic metabolic encephalopathy given no 
fever, leukocytosis or s/s infection and negative urine culture. 
No metabolic abnormalities (glucose 99, potassium 4.1). ___ recs 
for return to assisted living facility with home ___.
 
#Injuries from fall: OSH showed negative CT head and C-spine. He 
sustained multiple injuries after his fall, including right ear 
avulsion and left sixth rib fracture. Plastic surgery sutured 
the ear and he is scheduled for follow up in the outpatient 
setting. For the rib fracture, he completed aggressive incentive 
spirometry and pain control with Tylenol prn. 

#Meningioma: MRI showed interval progression of disease with new 
lesions and possible hemorrhage within the lesions. Dr. ___, 
___ patient's ___, was notified and recommended 
outpatient follow-up, which was arranged. Progressive disease 
was not thought to be cause of patient's fall.

#T2DM: He was placed on 10U Lantus BID with HISS (he was 
recently switched to glargine qd at home). 

#Hypertension: continued Losartan 25mg daily. For OSA, placed on 
CPAP, and for GERD, we continued omeprazole.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,

You were admitted to ___ for an 
unwitnessed fall likely secondary to seizure. We monitored your 
brain waves on EEG which showed no concern for increased risk of 
seizures. Our neurologists evaluated you and believe you should 
continue your home Keppra and valproic acid and you should make 
sure to take them everyday. While you were here, we monitored 
your heart and it showed no signs of abnormal rhythms.

We also repeated MRI ___ ___. On the MRI, we found interval 
increase in meningioma size. Dr. ___ is aware of the MRI 
findings and will follow up with you for your care. The plan is
