History of Present Illness:
Mrs. ___ is a ___ right handed woman with a past
medical history of multiple sclerosis on copaxone and OSA who
presents with a 10 day history of dizziness, with MRI findings 
of
multiple cranial nerve enhancement with concern for Ramsay Hunt
Syndrome.

History is gathered from the patient.

Essentially, she was in her baseline state of health until 10
days ago when she was out at a concert with her husband.  There
she had sudden onset of "dizziness".  She describes this as a
sensation of unsteadiness (no presyncope, no vertigo at that
time).  Since its onset, this sensation has essentially 
continued
unabated.  The sensation of unsteadiness would improve (though
not completely resolve when laying flat or sitting).  This
unsteadiness worsened gradually over several days.  It was
associated with a soft "clicking" sound in her left ear.  

She was seen by her PCP and prescribed antibiotics for possible
sinusitis.

This changed roughly 4 days ago, when shortly after getting up,
she had onset of vertigo (spinning sensation), lasting several
hours and then spontaneously resolving.  It has not recurred
since.  She also developed intermittent sharp left ear pain. It
is brief and "electric" in nature.  It occurs ___ without
clear inciting event.

For the past several days she has been generally fatiuged and
"sleeping a lot".  Though she has remained at home she feels 
very
unsteady and is worried she may fall.  When walking, she feels
like she veers to the right.  

Additionally, for the past day she endorses she feels like her
eyes are not "focus right".  She denies double or blurry vision
and cannot really clarify.  However, she states she has been
keeping one eye closed (either) to help improve her symptoms.

For these symptoms, she was evaluated by her Neurologist, Dr.
___ at ___ on ___ and subsequently referred for an MRI.

She underwent MRI Brain w/ and w/o contrast yesterday which
revealed "enhancement of the left geniculate ganglion and the
intracanalicular portions left facial nerves suggesting a viral
illness".  Following these results, she was referred to our ED. 

Of note, she has had nothing like this prior.  She endorses
recent sick contacts with URI symptoms.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ is a ___ right handed woman with a past medical 
history of multiple sclerosis on copaxone and OSA who presented 
with a 10 day history of dizziness, with MRI findings of 
multiple cranial nerve enhancement diagnosed with varicella 
zoster oticus or ___ Syndrome.

Her exam was notable for left facial nerve palsy, left ear pain, 
herpetic vesicles on left tympanic membrane and left side of 
palate, decreased hearing on left, torsional nystagmus and 
unstable gait. She underwent lumbar puncture which showed a  
lymphocytic pleocytosis to 283 and elevated protein to 83, and 
MRI findings of left facial nerve and possible vestibular nerve 
enhancement concerning for viral illness. Given this 
constellation of findings, the etiology of her presentation was 
thought most likely secondary to Ramsay Hunt Syndrome. CSF VZV 
confirmed this diagnosis. She was started on empiric treatment 
with IV Acyclovir. Infectious disease was consulted who 
recommended completion of a 10 day IV course with transition to 
PO Valacyclovir to complete a   ___ PICC line was 
placed to complete the IV therapy as an outpatient. She was also 
started on Prednisone 60mg for inflammation to complete a rapid 
taper as an outpatient. She will follow-up with neurology and ID 
as an outpatient.
