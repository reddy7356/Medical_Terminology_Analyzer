Brief Hospital Course:
He was admitted on ___ and was taken to the operating 
room. He underwent off-pump coronary artery bypass graft x1 with 
the skeletonized left internal mammary artery graft to left 
anterior descending artery. Please see operative note for full 
details. He tolerated the procedure well and was transferred to 
the CVICU in stable condition for recovery and invasive 
monitoring. 
 
He weaned from sedation, awoke neurologically intact and was 
extubated on POD 1. He was weaned from a nitro gtt and 
transitioned to Imdur. Beta blocker was initiated and he was 
diuresed toward his preoperative weight. Patient had significant 
post-op nausea for 48hr which eventually resolved. He advanced 
to full diet, Liver function tests remained stable. He remained 
hemodynamically stable and was transferred to the telemetry 
floor for further recovery. Pacing wires and chest tubes were 
removed without incident. Blood pressure medications were 
adjusted and BP remained stable. He was evaluated by the 
physical therapy service for assistance with strength and 
mobility. By the time of discharge on POD 4 he was ambulating 
freely, the wound was healing, and pain was controlled with oral 
analgesics. He was discharged home with ___ services in good
