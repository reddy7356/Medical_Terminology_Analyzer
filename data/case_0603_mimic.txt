Pertinent Results:
MR ___ SPINE W/O CONTRAST ___ 
1. Mild spondylolisthesis and degenerative changes in the 
cervical spine 
result in moderate spinal canal narrowing at C4-5 and C5-6. The 
spinal cord is edematous from C3-4 through C5-6, suggesting a 
contusion. 
  
2. Extensive prevertebral edema in the cervical spine. Mild 
marrow edema 
associated with the known fracture of the anterior superior 
corner of the C6 vertebral body. Apparent marrow edema in the C4 
and C5 vertebral bodies, suggesting contusions, since no 
fracture lines are seen on the preceding cervical spine CT scan. 

  
3. Edema in the C5 spinous process related to the known 
fracture. Edema in 
the C4-5 interspinous ligaments, and adjacent to the tip of the 
C6 spinous 
processes. 
  
4. Chronic compression fracture of the T7 vertebral body. 
Multilevel disc 
disease in the thoracic spine, without cord compression or cord 
edema. 
  
5. Severe compression fracture of the L1 vertebral body with 
retropulsion and moderate spinal canal narrowing, but no 
compression of the conus medullaris or conus edema. Marrow edema 
within the L1 vertebral body suggests an acute or 
acute-on-chronic fracture. 
  
6. Degenerative disease in the lower lumbar spine with severe 
spinal canal 
narrowing and severe right neural foraminal narrowing at L4-5. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ y/o M intoxicated, s/p fall down stairs into snow bank. He 
was brought to OSH with h/o old compression fx T1 and L5. He was 
seen to have cord contusion at C3-4 through C5-6 on MRI as well 
as L1 compression fracture. He was placed in c-collar and 
admitted to ICU for monitoring. Exam was weak in BUE 
distal>proximal. On ___, patient was stable, a TLSO brace was 
ordered for his L1 compression fracture. 
He was consented for a circumfrential fusion C4-7 with 
instrumentation for his fracture and stenosis.
Post-operatively he was given pain medication and antibiotics.  
A hemovac drain was placed intraoperatively and was removed POD 
#2 from his posterior decompression and fusion.  He failed a 
voiding trial and the foley was replaced.  This will be managed 
at rehab.
He was febrile overnight on POD #3 and a fever workup was 
negative.  Incentive spirometer was encouraged and he 
deffervessed.  He was discharged in good condition and will 
follow up with Dr. ___ in 10 days.
