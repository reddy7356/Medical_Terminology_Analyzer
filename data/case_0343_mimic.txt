Brief Hospital Course:
MICU COURSE: Ms. ___ is an ___ yo F w/ vulvar mass and inguinal 
lymphadenopathy, who presented to ___ with abdominal pain, found 
to be hypotensive and tachycardic and transferred to ___ for 
further management. Her hypotension and tachycardic were 
attributed to likely septic shock given the erythema and pain on 
her abdominal wall in the setting of leukocytosis with 
neutrophilic predominance, perhaps from metastatic 
lympadenopathy which became super-infected. She was treated 
empirically with vanc/zosyn, day ___, and received IVF for 
resuscitation to maintain MAP>60. Blood and urine cultures were 
obtained. She went to ___ for ultrasound guided drainage of an 
intraabdominal wall fluid collection (thought to be an abscess 
v. a necrotic lymph node), but ultrasound did not reveal enough 
fluid to make drainage useful, and she demonstrated a need for 
more anesthesia than had been originally planned. Her 
hypotension and tachycardia improved on antibiotics and IVF, and 
she was transferred to gyn/onc for further evaluation and 
management, with plans for vulvar biopsy and exam under 
anesthesia. 

On ___, Ms ___ was taken to the OR and she underwent exam 
under anesthesia and biopsy of the vulvar mass. Per the 
operative report, a 5 cm necrotic, fixed, R inguinal node was 
identified with overlying erythema. The L labia minora and into 
the majora, was replaced by tumor that was approximately 3-4 cm 
in size. It
extended into the vaginal canal and towards the rectovaginal 
septum. The cervix was not amenable to examination. Rectal exam 
revealed no abnormalities. Please see operative note for 
details. Pathology showed invasive squamous cell carcinoma, well 
to moderately differentiated.

Her post-operative course is detailed as follows. Immediately 
postoperatively, her pain was controlled with IV Dilaudid. Her 
diet was advanced without difficulty and she was transitioned to 
Percocet->vicodin. On post-operative day #1, her urine output 
was adequate so her Foley catheter was removed and she voided 
spontaneously. She was followed by infectious disease and her IV 
antibiotics were transitioned to PO Augmentin on ___ x 2 
weeks with improving symptoms. She remained afebrile and 
non-tachycardic on PO antibiotics. She had a few episodes of 
diarrhea with negative C. Diff. ___ blood cultures no growth 
to date.

Hematology oncology and radiation oncology were consulted for 
her care. Family was included in discussions, including health 
care proxy, grandson ___. Family meeting was held with 
hematology oncology, radiation oncology and gynecologic oncology 
present to discuss treatment options, which included possibility 
of low dose chemotherapy and radiation for palliative care. 
Decision was made to follow up care as outpatient at facility 
closer to patient's home. 

She received physical therapy during her stay and will receive 
follow-up physical therapy and visiting nursing service at home. 
Side rails were recommended. 
By post-operative day 3, she was tolerating a regular diet, 
voiding spontaneously, ambulating with walker, and pain was 
controlled with oral medications. She was then discharged home 
with family members. She was in stable condition with outpatient 
radiation oncology and gynecologic oncology follow-up.
