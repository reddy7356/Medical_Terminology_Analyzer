History of Present Illness:
___ is a ___ year old male with history of hypertension,
hyperlipidemia and CKD who presents with vertigo.

History obtained from he and his wife. He reports he has been in
his usual state of health without recent infections or 
illnesses.
He woke up this morning and as he got up out of bed and was
walking he felt like he was staggering and there was a slight
movement type sensation. He was able to go about his morning,
make breakfast and eat without difficulty. Then around ___ when
he was sitting down he suddenly had severe dizziness (he has
difficulty describing this but thinks things were moving). It 
was
so severe he had nausea and vomiting. He tried to walk but he
couldn't. He thinks the dizziness was constant but definitely
worsens with any movement. He denies vision changes, slurred
speech, weakness, tingling or numbness. No ear pain, pressure or
fullness. He had no headache. Due to all these symptoms he
decided to come to the ED. 

At time of my evaluation he is still dizzy although if he lies
completely still then it is better. He still is without 
headache.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ is a ___ year old male with HTN, CKD, and BPH who is 
admitted to the Neurology stroke service with instability and 
vertigo secondary to an acute ischemic/hemorrhagic stroke in the 
left cerebellum. His stroke was most likely secondary to 
cardioembolic event given lack of significant atherosclerotic dz 
on CTA head/neck. We did not consider this a failure of ASA as 
the patient had stopped taking his aspirin for primary 
prevention 3 wks ago per PCP ___. He was started on 
aspirin and clopidogrel on admission, which will be continued at 
discharge. His deficits improved greatly prior to discharge and 
the only notable deficits was instability and left-sided ataxia. 
He will be discharged with a Zio patch on discharge to monitor 
for A fib. He was evaluated by ___ and will continue rehab at 
a rehab center upon discharge. 

His stroke risk factors include the following:
1) DM: A1c 6.1%
2) No significant intracranial atherosclerosis 
3) Hyperlipidemia: not on statin, not controlled with LDL 156
4) Overweight
5) No concern noted for or known diagnosis of sleep apnea 
An echocardiogram did not show a PFO on bubble study.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,

You were hospitalized due to symptoms of vertigo and instability 
resulting from an ACUTE ISCHEMIC STROKE, a condition where a 
blood vessel providing oxygen and nutrients to the brain is 
blocked by a clot. The brain is the part of your body that 
controls and directs all the other parts of your body, so damage 
to the brain from being deprived of its blood supply can result 
in a variety of symptoms.

Stroke can have many different causes, so we assessed you for 
medical conditions that might raise your risk of having stroke. 
In order to prevent future strokes, we plan to modify those risk 
factors. Your risk factors are:
HIGH CHOLESTEROL
PRE-DIABETES

We are changing your medications as follows:
START aspirin, clopidogrel, and atorvastatin

Please take your other medications as prescribed.

Please follow up with Neurology and your primary care physician 
as listed below.

If you experience any of the symptoms below, please seek 
emergency medical attention by calling Emergency Medical 
Services (dialing 911). In particular, since stroke can recur, 
please pay attention to the sudden onset and persistence of 
these symptoms:
- Sudden partial or complete loss of vision
- Sudden loss of the ability to speak words from your mouth
- Sudden loss of the ability to understand others speaking to 
you
- Sudden weakness of one side of the body
- Sudden drooping of one side of the face
- Sudden loss of sensation of one side of the body

Sincerely,
Your ___ Neurology Team

___ Chest X-ray (PA and Lat): FINDINGS: AP and lateral chest 
with no comparison available demonstrates no definite foreign 
body in the region of the esophagus. A 6-mm calcified nodule is 
seen in the left lower lung, likely a granuloma. The lungs are 
otherwise clear without consolidation, effusion, or 
pneumothorax. Calcified mediastinal nodes are likely the sequela 
of prior granulomatous infection. There is a tortuous contour of 
the ascending and descending aorta which also 
appearsaneurysmally dilated. The heart size is normal. The 
pulmonary vasculature is normal in appearance. 
IMPRESSION:

indicated, 
this could be further evaluated with chest CT.

FINDINGS: There is mild bilateral dependent atelectasis with 
some 
bronchiectasis at the bases which could indicate chronic 
aspiration. No 
pneumothorax is present. A calcified granuloma within the lung 
parenchyma measuring up to 6 mm in the left lower lobe (2:34). 
Within the mediastinum, several calcified lymph nodes are also 
seen. 
There is diffuse thickening of the esophageal wall, including at 
the thoracic inlet. No foreign body is seen. No definite 
extraluminal air or fluid is seen. The ascending thoracic aorta 
is mildly aneurysmal measuring up to 4.1 x 4.0 cm (2:21). No 
pathologically enlarged lymph nodes are seen. The airways are 
patent to the segmental level. 
No concerning osseous lesion is seen. The included portions of 
the upper 
abdomen are grossly unremarkable. 
IMPRESSION:  
1. Esophageal wall thickening which could indicate inflammation. 
No foreign body or definite extraluminal air or fluid seen. 
2. Aneurysmal dilation of the ascending thoracic aorta.

___ Portable AP Chest X-ray:  
Atelectasis at both the right and left base is present. No 
mediastinal air 
identified. No pneumothorax is present.

.
# Pressure Ulcer / Gastritis - The patient was admitted to the 
MICU for concern of mediastinitis after swallowing a fish bone 
as CT of the chest showed esophageal thickening but no 
mediastinal air. In the MICU, EGD was performed by GI which 
found a large fish bone in the upper esophagus distal of the 
UES. The bone was pushed into the stomach. The patient was 
intubated for careful examination of the esophagus and concern 
for aspiration. After intubation, the exam was repeated and 
showed an ulcer at the site of the impacted fish bone in the at 
the upper esophageal sphincter as well as esophagitis localized 
to the GE junction and gastritis without bleeding. The patient 
was successfuly extubated following procedure.  Pathology on the 
fish bone was pending at the time of discharge.  The patient was 
started on carafate and PPI therapy.  H.pylori serology was sent 
and returned "equivocal".  The patient will continue on PPI 
therapy for ___ weeks.  Follow-up chest x-ray showed no 
mediastinal air.  He should have a follow-up EGD in 4 weeks to 
document resolution.
