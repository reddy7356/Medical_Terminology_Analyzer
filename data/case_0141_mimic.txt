Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ is a ___ year old male status post liver transplant 
for hepatitis C cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma whose 
liver transplant was complicated by a biliary stricture and 
recurrent cirrhosis of the graft ___ HCV and ETOH relapse with 
chief complaint of confusion and headache, now found to have 
acute left
PCA infarct

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
====================
[ ] Discharged with Zio patch for evaluation of paroxysmal 
atrial fibrillation as etiology of acute stroke. If no evidence 
of atrial fibrillation is detected, further long-term monitoring 
may be clinically indicated.

[ ] RUQ ultrasound this admission revealed nonspecific new high 
resistance pattern in the hepatic arteries without definite 
antegrade diastolic flow. Patient is scheduled for repeat 
ultrasound on ___.

[ ] Needs tacrolimus level checked once per month

[ ] Goal LDL<70 post-stroke. Lipid panel should be checked ~3 
months after discharge to assess response to atorvastatin.

[ ] f/u BP with goal SBP < 140.

ACUTE/ACTIVE ISSUES:
====================
#Acute left PCA ischemic stroke
#Right homonymous hemianopsia
#Acute encephalopathy
Patient presented with ongoing confusion for a few days prior to 
admission, and a brief episode of
"blacking out", which likely represents a TIA. CT and MRI at 
outside hospital prior to admission were negative for acute 
pathology. He was quite aware of the confusion, commenting on 
his own deficits in his memory including difficulty with 
remembering his wife's birthday. He was oriented x2, unable to 
remember the year. Initial concern for possible encephalitis. LP 
was performed but returned frank blood, likely from epidural 
vessel. Patient reported vision disturbances and was found to 
have right homonymous hemianopsia. Repeat MRI/MRA of the brain 
revealed acute ischemic PCA infarct. Patient was started on ASA 
81mg and high-intensity atorvastatin. TTE did not show evidence 
of PFO. Patient did not exhibit any atrial fibrillation on 
telemetry, but was discharged with continuous monitoring for 
further evaluation.

#Headache
Patient presented with headache. Likely not secondary to acute 
stroke, as would be unusual. ___ be secondary to hypertension 
and tension/stress. Improved with reducing blood pressure and 
symptomatic therapy.

#Post-LP hematoma, stable
Patient developed post-procedural hematoma at entry site. Mildly 
TTP but otherwise did not exhibit any infectious signs. No 
neurological changes associated with post-procedural course, no 
progression in
pain. Managed supportively. 

#Hyponatremia
Mild hyponatremia on admission to 133 in setting of poor PO 
intake. Resolved with IVF.

#Liver transplant for chronic HCV and ___ c/b recurrent 
cirrhosis ___ HCV and ETOH relapse. CMV serology positive, VL 
negative. Patient was continued on home tacrolimus. Serus 
tacrolimus levels were stable and therapeutic throughout 
admission.

CHRONIC/STABLE ISSUES:
======================

recently suffered a CVA in ___, who was admitted for
transaminitis. The patient was placed on high-dose statin after 
his CVA in ___, however his LFTs began to rise and the 
medication was subsequently discontinued. He was admitted given 
the fact that his LFTs remain elevated despite being off of

and then underwent CTA of his liver which was normal. His LFTs 
continued to downtrend at the time of discharge. He was 
continued on home tacrolimus 1 mg BID.
