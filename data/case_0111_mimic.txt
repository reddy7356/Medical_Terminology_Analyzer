History of Present Illness:
Mr. ___ is an ___ year old man with a past medical history of 
HTN, CAD, DM, hypothyroidism who was found unresponsive this am. 
EMS was called, who would have intubated the patient in the 
field but family declined. Blood pressure in the field was 
notable for systolics in the 240s and he was given labetalol. He 
was brought to ___ ED, where a ___ showed a devastating 
large right hemispheric hemorrhage with midline shift and uncal 
herniation. Blood pressure on arrival still 220. Neurology and 
neurosurgery were both consulted.

Family arrived shortly thereafter and were clear that the

devastating bleed and poor prognosis. The decision was made to 
make the patient CMO in the emergency room.
