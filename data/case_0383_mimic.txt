3. Successful PTCA/Stenting of proximal/mid RCA with three 
overlapping 
VISION 3.0 X 12 mm Baremetal stents along with Export 
thrombectomey 
resulting in 0% residual stenosis and normal flow. 
  
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:     
1. Two vessel coronary artery disease.

stents 
in proximal and mid RCA. 

CTA Head/Neck ___:
IMPRESSION: 
  
1. CT head demonstrates no acute intracranial process; within 
the limitation of persistent contrast in the major cerebral 
arteries from recent cardiac catheterization, limiting the 
resolution of thrombus detection.  
  
2. Global dilatation of ventricles, unchanged since the earlier 
MR study of ___, in keeping with a degree of 
central cerebral volume loss.  
  
3. CTA neck demonstrates no hemodynamically significant 
stenosis, 
craniocervical dissection or luminal narrowing. 
  
4. Impression of luminal narrowing and soft tissue density at 
the upper 
cervical esophagus, near its ostium. Re-evaluation of symptoms

warranted on 
clinical grounds. 
  
4. Extensive centrilobular emphysema involving both upper lobes. 

  
MRI ___: No evidence of acute intracranial process. 
Unchanged global dilatation of ventricles in keeping with 
central volume loss since the earlier MR study of ___.

Echo results:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall 
thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There is mild regional 
left ventricular systolic dysfunction with very mild hypokinesis 
of the inferior wall. The remaining segments contract normally 
(LVEF = 55 %). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall 
motion are normal. The diameters of aorta at the sinus, 
ascending and arch levels are normal. The aortic valve leaflets 
(3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and 
no aortic stenosis. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The 
mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal. There is no 
mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. 
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined. 
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

angina presenting with sudden onset bilateral arm pain secondary 
to RCA STEMI.
.  
# Right Coronary Artery STEMI: The patient underwent cardiac 
catheterization with placement of three bare metal stents in the 
proximal and mid RCA with no complications. Her pressures were 
supported postoperativly with IV fluids. Integrillin was hung 
for 18 hours post-procedure. Her EKG and troponins returned to 
normal. She was angina-free for the duration of her 
hospitalization. Her BB was initially held secondary to risk of 
high degree heart block following RCA STEMI. She remained in 
normal sinus rhythm for the duration of her hospitalization and 
was restarted at metoprolol XL 25mg PO daily. She should 
continue aspirin and plavix for 30 days post operatively.  
.
Slurred speech: Immediatly post-procedure the patient was noted 
to have slurred speech and confusion that was a deviation from 
baseline mental status per her son. ___ was consulted. 
Imaging of the head and neck was without evidence of hemmorhage 
but preliminary reads were concerning for apossible left ICA 
thrombus. She was started on a heparin drip overnight. Further 
review of the imaging the following morning was not consistent 
with an ICA thrombus and the heparin was stopped. A follow up 
MRI was negative for any intracranial process. Her AMS was 
thought to be secondary to sedative medications received during 
the procedure and ICU delirium. She began to clear within two 
days.
.
Incidental finding on Neck CTA:  Imaging also showed an 
incidental finding of luminal narrowing and soft tissue density 
at the upper cervical esophagus, near its ostium. Follow-up 
evaluation is advised with EGD especially if clinically 
correlated. The patient was asymptomatic during her 
hospitalization. The pateint should follow up with her primary 
care physician to determine if further evaluation is needed.

Hypertension
Dyslipidemia
Chronic Memory Loss with Acute Delerium

 
Discharge Condition:
Mental Status: Confused - sometimes.
Level of Consciousness: Alert and interactive.
Activity Status: Ambulatory - requires assistance or aid (walker 
or cane).

 
Discharge Instructions:
You had a heart attack and needed to have 3 bare metal stents 
placed in your right coronary artery. You have not had any 
further chest pain since this procedure. You will need to take 
aspirin and plavix every day for at least one month and possibly 
longer to prevent the stents from clotting off and causing 
another heart attack. Do not stop taking these medicines unless 
Dr. ___ you it is OK. 
You have some bruising in your groin from the catheterization, 
this should resolve slowly. You also had some confusion we call 
delerium from being in the hospital, this should resolve 
completely over the next few weeks. 
Medication changes:
1. Start taking aspirin and Plavix (clopidogrel) to prevent the 
stents from clotting off
2. Start taking Metoprolol to help your heart recover from the 
heart attack
3. Start taking Atorvastatin (Lipitor) to prevent more blockages 
in your heart arteries. 
4. Stop taking Nexium, take Ranitidine instead to prevent 
heartburn.

bronchiectasis presenting with acute worsening of chronic 
dyspnea and cough. 

Active issues:
#) Dyspnea and cough: Patient with productive cough, but no 
fevers and a normal WBC which was thought most likely due to 
COPD exacerbation as she has history of emphysema and radiation 
induced bronchiectasis. CHF exacerbation also considered, 
although patient did not appear volume overloaded on exam and 
BNP was normal. She was treated with steroids, nebulizers and 
azithromycin. Her cough was also treated symptomatically.

Chronic issues:

and etoposide with radiation for a total of 6 cycles ending in 
___.  She also underwent prophylactic cranial irradiation in 
___. Chest CT ___ showed no signs of recurrence. 

#) HTN: stable on home metoprolol

#) CAD: Continued on ASA, atorvastatin, and metoprolol 

#) GERD: Stable on pantoprazole and sucralfate

#) hypothyroidism: stable on home levothyroxine 

Transitional issues:
- She desaturated to 88% with exertion on room air and remained 
moderately short of breath on exertion which improved with 
oxygen. Her baseline resting O2 sats remained 93-98% while 
hospitalized. She was discharged home with oxygen to use for 
dypsnea on exertion. She has 24 hour supervision and home 
nursing care. 
- Recommended for home ___.
