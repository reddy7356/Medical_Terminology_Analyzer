Discharge Instructions:
Mr ___,
You were admitted to the ___ under the Acute Care Trauma 
Surgery service after sustaining injuries from a fall. You 
fractured your right ___, and 11th rib, had a small injury to 
your lung, and fractured your right radius. You were seen by the 
orthopedic doctors who determined your arm fracture is 
non-operable and only requires a cast. You will follow up in 
their clinic next week. You were monitored overnight and a 
repeat chest X-Ray from this morning shows your lung injury is 
improved. You are ready to return home to continue your 
recovery. 

* Your injury caused 2 rib fractures which can cause severe pain 
and subsequently cause you to take shallow breaths because of 
the pain.
 
* You should take your pain medication as directed to stay ahead 
of the pain otherwise you won't be able to take deep breaths. If 
the pain medication is too sedating take half the dose and 
notify your physician.
 
* Pneumonia is a complication of rib fractures.  In order to 
decrease your risk you must use your incentive spirometer 4 
times every hour while awake.  This will help expand the small 
airways in your lungs and assist in coughing up secretions that 
pool in the lungs.
 
* You will be more comfortable if you use a cough pillow to hold 
against your chest and guard your rib cage while coughing and 
deep breathing.
 
* Symptomatic relief with ice packs or heating pads for short 
periods may ease the pain.
 
* Narcotic pain medication can cause constipation therefore you 
should take a stool softener twice daily and increase your fluid 
and fiber intake if possible.
 
* Do NOT smoke
 
* If your doctor allows, non-steroidal ___ drugs 
are very effective in controlling pain ( ie, Ibuprofen, Motrin, 
Advil, Aleve, Naprosyn) but they have their own set of side 
effects so make sure your doctor approves.
 
* Return to the Emergency Room right away for any acute 
shortness of breath, increased pain or crackling sensation 
around your ribs (crepitus).
