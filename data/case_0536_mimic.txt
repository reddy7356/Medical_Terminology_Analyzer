Father with an MI at ___ - died of bladder CA in his ___  
Mother died of COPD complications.  

 
Physical Exam:
Gen: Awake and alert, no acute distress
Resp: CTAB
CV: Regular rate and rhythm
Abdomen: Soft, nontender, nondistended
Pulses: Radial and ulnar pulses palpable bilaterally; lower 
extremity pulses palpable throughout
Incisions: RUE incision clean, dry, intact; cellulitis 
improving; R groin incision clean, dry intact
 
Pertinent Results:
___ - CTA Chest
IMPRESSION:  
1.  Short segment filling defect in the distal right brachial 
artery extending to the proximal radial and ulnar arteries at 
the level of the antecubital fossa with reconstitution of flow 
distally. 
2.  No evidence of mycotic aneurysm. 
3.  Mild bronchial wall thickening, may be inflammatory or 
infectious. 
4.  Two renal arteries on the left, a normal anatomic variant. 

___ - Transthoracic Echo
Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal. Overall left 
ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right 
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The 
aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good 
leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic 
regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. 
There is mild anterior leaflet mitral valve prolapse. No masses 
or vegetations are seen on the mitral valve, but cannot be fully 
excluded due to suboptimal image quality. Moderate (2+) mitral 
regurgitation is seen. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure 
could not be determined. There is no pericardial effusion. 

IMPRESSION: No clear evidence of valvular vegetations (better 
excluded by TEE). Mild anterior leaflet prolapse with moderate 
mitral regurgitation. Preserved biventricular systolic function. 


___ - Transesophageal Echo

 
Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ was admitted to ___ 
on ___ with right arm weakness and diminished pulses. A CTA 
chest was performed, which showed short segment filling defect 
in the distal right brachial artery extending to the proximal 
radial and ulnar arteries at the level of the antecubital fossa. 
She underwent a right brachial artery bypass with right 
saphenous vein graft on ___. The procedure was 
uncomplicated. On POD #1, she was doing well and her pain was 
well controlled with oral pain medication. She did have a 
cellulitis around her arm incision, which was marked with a pen. 
On POD #2, she was able to liberalize her arm activity. Her 
cellulitis began to improve, and her hand weakness began to 
return to normal. She had a new pain at the tip of her right 
finger, for which we consulted cardiology. They recommended a 
TEE to evaluated for residual vegetations on her mitral valve, 
which was negative. Additionally, they recommended no need for 
anticoagulation long term. The infectious disease team 
recommended no changes to her antibiotic course and will 
follow-up with her next week. Neurosurgery recommended no 
changes to their plan, and will follow-up with her as previously 
scheduled. On POD #4, she was discharged home in stable 
condition.

ECHO (___):
The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. No 
atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. Overall 
left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right 
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The

aortic stenosis is not present. No masses or vegetations are 
seen on the aortic valve. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The 
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is mild 
anterior leaflet mitral valve prolapse. There is a 
moderate-sized vegetation on the atrial surface of the anterior 
mitral valve leaflet measuring 0.9 cm long x 0.9 cm wide. No 
mitral valve abscess is seen. Mild to moderate (___) 
posteriorly directed mitral regurgitation is seen. No 
vegetation/mass is seen on the pulmonic valve. There is no 
pericardial effusion. 

IMPRESSION: Anterior mitral valve leaflet endocarditis without 
abscess. No other valvular disease. 

ECG:
___: Sinus rhythm. Baseline artifact. Non-specific T wave 
changes. No previous 
tracing available for comparison.  

___: Normal sinus rhythm. Non-specific anterior T wave 
abnormality that may be a normal variant. Compared to the 
previous tracing of ___ anterior T wave abnormality is new 
but non-specific. 

CT HEAD (___):
1. Small out-pouching at the distal M4 segment of the right MCA 
which is 
concerning for a mycotic aneurysm. 
2. The major intracranial arteries appear patent without 
evidence of stenosis 
or occlusion. 
3. The vertebral and carotid arteries appear patent without 
stenosis or 
occlusion. 

ULTRASOUND UPPER EXTREMITY (___):
No fluid collection seen in the superficial tissues of the right 
arm.

THREE-VESSEL CEREBRAL ANGIOGRAM (___):
Left common carotid artery:  The left carotid bifurcation is 
without 
arteriosclerotic disease of stenosis.  The left intracranial 
circulation is unremarkable.  
Right internal carotid artery:  The right intracranial 
circulation is notable for 2 mm mycotic aneurysm in the very 
distal MCA territory. 
Left vertebral artery:  The posterior circulation is 
unremarkable. 
IMPRESSION:  
Right distal MCA mycotic aneurysm measuring approximately 2 mm 
in maximum 
diameter. 

THREE-VESSEL CEREBRAL ANGIOGRAM (AFTER COILING):
Right internal carotid artery:  The intracranial circulation is 
unremarkable 
with the exception of a 2 mm aneurysm in the area of the motor 
strip very 
distal in an M4 branch.  After placement of 1 coil there is near 
complete 
obliteration of the aneurysm.  No thromboembolic complications 
encountered. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ with strep viridans endocarditis on antibiotics since ___, 
transferred to ___ for concern of complicated by diffuse 
septic emboli including bleeding cerebral aneurysms.  

#Endocarditis with mitral valve vegetations: 
She was evaluated by Infectious Disease, Cardiac Surgery and 
Neurosurgery during her admission. Her antibiotics were 
continued as prior (IV ceftriaxone and gentamicin). She had a 
TEE showing a smaller sized vegetation than prior. She was 
considered for cardiac surgery given ongoing septic embolic 
phenomena and thus had a cerebral angiogram and subsequent 
vessel coiling of an infectious aneurysm to prevent further 
hemorrhagic risk if anticoagulation would be needed. Her septic 
phenomena subsided with significant clinical improvement, thus 
her care teams decided she could be discharged on the antibiotic 
regimen with close follow up and monitoring.

#RUE pain/swelling/weakness: The patient had ___ pain on both 
the medial and lateral aspects of her left antecubital fossa. In 
the ED, she was evaluated by neurology in ED who felt her 
weakness was not consistent with an UMN pathology and that it 
was most likely ___ pain and direct injury of emboli in her arm. 
MRI showed septic emboli in the brain but they did not feel 
these were the cause of her finger weakness. The lesions was 
evaluated by ultrasound, and the imaging did not show any sign 
of fluid collection. We treated her pain (Oxycodone Q4H, 
Lidoderm topical patch Q12H, Acetominophen 1000 mg Q8H), and her 
broad spectrum antibiotic coverage was also continued. We 
monitored the growth and progress of the margins of infection. 
Exam was significantly improved at the time of discharge.

#Anemia: Unknown baseline no evidence of active bleed.  
#HTN: Continued atenolol goal BP<180 per neuro recs  
#Depression: continued zoloft

Discharge Instructions:
Ms. ___, 

It was a pleasure taking care of you at ___ 
___. You were admitted for management of bacterial 
endocarditis complicated by septic emboli (showering of bacteria 
into your arm, hands, feet and brain).  While you were here, you 
were continued on IV antibiotics to treat your infection and 
medications to control your pain. You also underwent several 
procedures including a transesophageal echocardiogram, a 
cerebral angiogram which revealed a 2mm infectious aneurysm, and 
a subsequent endovascular aneurysm coiling to repair the 
aneurysm. You improved greatly while you were admitted, and 
therefore it was decided that a heart valve surgery is not 
needed at this time. 

Please take all your medications as described, (IV ceftriaxone 
until ___, IV gentamicin until ___. Please make sure to follow 
up with all your scheduled appointments. Please have another 
echocardiogram (through your PCP) after finishing your 
antibiotic regimen and have the result faxed to Dr. ___ 
___ ___. You should also ask your PCP to help you 
establish care with an infectious disease physician in your 
local area. 

We wish you the best in your recovery.
