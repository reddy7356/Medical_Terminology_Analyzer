Pertinent Results:
Transthoracic Echocardiogram ___
The left atrial volume index is normal. There is mild symmetric 
left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size. There is 
mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with basal 
inferior hypokinesis. The remaining segments contract normally 
(LVEF = 50%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall 
motion are normal. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. There 
are three aortic valve leaflets. The aortic valve leaflets are 
moderately thickened. There is severe aortic valve stenosis 
(valve area 1.0cm2, indexed ___ 0.5 cm2/m2). No aortic 
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly 
thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The pulmonary 
artery systolic pressure could not be determined. There is no 
pericardial effusion. 

IMPRESSION: Mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction, 
c/w CAD. Severe aortic stenosis. Mild mitral regurgitation.  

Carotid Ultrasound ___
Right ICA <40% stenosis. Left ICA <40% stenosis. 

Transesophageal Echocardiogram ___
Conclusions   
 No mass/thrombus is seen in the left atrium or left atrial 
appendage. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. 
Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal. Overall left 
ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50-55%). Right 
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. There 
are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. No 
thoracic aortic dissection is seen. There is moderate aortic 
valve stenosis (valve area 1.0-1.2cm2). No aortic regurgitation 
is seen. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with 
trivial mitral regurgitation. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is 
seen. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion. The 
interatrial septum is lipomatous .There is no interatrial septal 
defect
 Post Bypass
 Bilateral ventriculr function is normal .There is no regional 
wall motion abnormality.The bioprosthetic aortic valve is well 
seated and .There is no paravalvular leak.The transaortic 
gradients is 7 mmHg.The mitral regurgitation is mildd The 
tricusid regurgitation is trace
 The Thoracic aorta iis intact

Brief Hospital Course:
He was admitted on ___ and underwent routine preoperative 
testing and evaluation. He was cleared by the dental service for 
surgery. He remained stable and was taken to the operating room 
on ___. He underwent coronary artery bypass grafting x 4 
and aortic valve replacement. Please see operative note for full 
details. He tolerated the procedure well and was transferred to 
the CVICU in stable condition for recovery and invasive 
monitoring.  Prevena dressing applied to optimize wound healing. 
 It will be discontinued at rehab on POD 7.
  
He weaned from sedation, awoke neurologically intact and was 
extubated on POD 1. He was weaned from vasopressor support. Beta 
blocker was initiated and he was diuresed toward his 
preoperative weight. He developed atrial fibrillation with rapid 
ventricular response and was treated with Amiodarone.  
Anti-coagulation is not required due to brevity of AFib.  He 
remained hemodynamically stable and was transferred to the 
telemetry floor for further recovery. A KUB demonstrated dilated 
loops of bowel and he was made NPO.  Reglan was initiated with 
good effect.  Diet advanced as tolerated.  He had regular bowel 
movements prior to discharge.  He was evaluated by the physical 
therapy service for assistance with strength and mobility. By 
the time of discharge on POD 6 he was ambulating freely, the 
wound was healing, and pain was controlled with oral analgesics. 
He was discharged to ___ in good condition with 
appropriate follow up instructions.
