MICRO:

___ 11:40 am FLUID RECEIVED IN BLOOD CULTURE BOTTLES
PERITONEAL FLUID. 
Fluid Culture in Bottles (Preliminary):    NO GROWTH

RESPIRATORY CULTURE (Final ___: 
RARE GROWTH Commensal Respiratory Flora. 

Blood Culture, Routine (Final ___:    NO GROWTH. 

IMAGING: 
========
___ Abdominal U/S
IMPRESSION: 
1. Occlusive or near occlusive main portal vein thrombus.  
Equivocal 
hepatopetal flow is poorly reproducible in the left portal vein 
branch. 
2. Cirrhotic hepatic morphology. 
3. Moderate to large amount of ascites.  Spleen not identified. 
4. Cholelithiasis without evidence of cholecystitis.  CBD not 
seen. 

___ ECHO
The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. No 
atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left 
ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and regional/global 
systolic function are normal (LVEF >55%). Diastolic function 
could not be assessed. The right ventricular cavity is mildly 
dilated with borderline normal free wall function. The aortic 
valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet 
excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation. The 
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral 
valve prolapse. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly 
thickened. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There 
is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no 
pericardial effusion. 

IMPRESSION: Mildly dilated right ventricle with borderline free 
wall systolic function. Normal left ventricular cavity sizes 
with preserved global / regional systolic function. Moderate 
tricuspid regurgitation. Mild pulmonary hypertension. Bilateral 
pleural effusions with significant atelectasis are noted.   

CXR ___
Right PIC line is still looped in the right brachiocephalic 
vein.  Widespread infiltrative pulmonary abnormality has 
improved, reflecting a decrease in the component of edema.  
Heart size is normal.  Pleural effusions are presumed but not 
large.  No pneumothorax. ET tube in standard placement.  
Nasogastric tube ends in the upper stomach. Right jugular line 
ends in the mid SVC. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ with pmhx of ETOH Cirrhosis who presents from OSH with 
variceal bleed and septic shock. Patient with prolonged hospital 
course with many significant complications as detailed below. 

Two weeks after his initial bleeding event, Mr. ___ 
developed a second major upper GI bleed, presumably from 
recurrent rupture of his previously banded varices.  Massive 
transfusion protocol was activate and octreotide gtt started. 
Patient was re-intubated for airway protection and a 
___ tube was also reinserted to tamponade 
active bleeding. In spite of four vasopressor agents, patient 
with poor hemodynamics and significant metabolic derangements 
including rapidly rising lactate. Given his grim overall 
prognosis, it was determined that CPR was not indicated. A 
family meeting was held and it was determined that the medical 
team would maintain but not escalate medical care any further. 
In the early morning of ___, ___ expired. 

Relevant Medical Issues on this Admission
=========================================
# GIB: 
Pt presented with melena and hematemesis in setting of cirrhosis 
concerning for variceal bleed. Massive transfusion protocol was 
activated in the ___ was placed but with deflation of 
balloon patient continued to have bleeding. Liver was consulted 
and EGD was done which showed bleeding from varices. Four 
varices were banded and the patient was not bleeding at the end 
of the case. Patient was started on IV PPI BID and IV octreotide 
gtt, which he continued for one week. As detailed above, the 
patient had made significant progress and was called out of the 
ICU. Unfortunately, he returned to the ICU only a few hours 
later with recurrent massive UGIB. In spite of maximum rate four 
pressors, octeotride gtt, massive transfusion protocol, and 
___ tube, the patient expired the morning of ___. 

#Hypotension/Septic Shock: 
Pt had SBPs in ___. This was originally felt to be in the 
setting of hemorrhage but after patient stopped bleeding with 
stable Hgb, he continued to have tachycardia and hypotension 
requiring multiple pressors. He was felt to be in septic shock 
with fevers with source being aspiration pneumonia. He was 
started on vanc/cefepime/flagyl. He was resuscitated with 25% 
albumin. Paracentesis was done which was negative for SBP. UA 
was negative. BCx had no growth. Sputum gram stain showed gram 
positive cocci in clusters and pairs. Vanc was ___ due to 
negative MRSA nares. He completed a full course of antibiotics 
for VAP. 

# ___: 
Pt noted to have Cr 2.0 at OSH. Cr increased to 4.9 peak and 
patient was oliguric. Renal was consulted for CVVH but held off 
originally as patient's urine output slowly improved. Patient 
was diuresed with IV Lasix 200 mg and IV diuril but eventually 
UOP was not responding to this and was started on CVVH. His 
renal failure was thought to be secondary to ATN rather than 
hepatorenal syndrome. Two days prior to his death, the patient 
tolerated HD without issues. 

# Lactic Acidosis: 
Pt noted to have profound lactic acidosis with lactate of 21.9 
at OSH, now mildly improved to ___. Likely was in setting of 
hypovolemia from massive bleed as well as septic shock. Improved 
with volume resuscitation and antibiotics and remained stable 
until repeat bleeding episode. 

# Etoh Cirrhosis: 
Patient was found to have portal vein thrombosis on RUQ. He was 
not anticoagulated due to variceal bleeding. Paracentesis was 
done which was negative for SBP. LFTs increased and peaked at 
ALT 617/AST 5176 which was consistent with alcoholic hepatitis. 
Patient was not started on steroids due to concern for sepsis.

# Etoh abuse: 
Patient was given thiamine, folate, MVI.
