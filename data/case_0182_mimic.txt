history of headache, blurry vision, word finding difficulty and

H
e was evaluated at ___ for these symptoms where he

from ___. He was subsequently transferred to ___ for

Brief Hospital Course:
___ year old male with multiple CVAs, unknown etiology and 
history of likely vascular dementia, remote EtOH abuse who 
presented with ___ day history of headache, blurry vision, word 
finding difficulty and gait instability. 
.
#Acute ischemic infarcts
Exam notable for fully oriented but fluctuating inattentive exam 
and short term memory problems. No facial droop, motor full 
throughout, sensation intact, difficulty with finger tap L>R, 
gait unsteady and positive Romberg. He also had simultagnosia, 
ocular ataxia and ocular apraxia c/w with Balint's syndrome 
(bihemispheric parietal-occipital old infarcts). CTA head and 
neck at OSH with concern for possible ICA flap/dissection so was 
admitted for MRA fat saturation images. MRA without dissection 
(likely ulcerative plaque)with acute punctate infarcts 
bilaterally and old bihemispheric parietal occipital infarcts 
c/w ?watershed etiology. Etiology of acute infarcts uncertain 
but thought to be cardioembolic given bilateral nature of 
infarcts. In addition, artery to artery embolus was also 
possible given significant vascular disease. 
.
In terms of cardioembolic w/u: TTE negative for PFO, thrombus or 
atrial appendage but does have enlarged LA. TEE not done as his 
prior TEE at ___ was negative for PFO and thrombus. He does have 
risk factors for afib give ?snoring and possible OSA (although 
no nocturnal desats here). TSH wnl. Hypercoagulable work-up only 
notable for indeterminate cardiolipin IgM. D-Dimer ~1700, but CT 
torso negative for malignant process. 
.
Anticoagulation was discussed given his prior multiterritorial 
infarcts. However, because we had no clear evidence of an 
embolic source and there was still a possibility of watershed or 
artery to artery pathology, he was continued on aspirin and 
Plavix. He will be discharged with ___ of hearts monitor 
given the high suspicion for cardioembolic disease. 
.
Simvastatin 40 mg was changed to atorvastatin 40 mg daily (LDL 
81). A1c 5.6. Lisinopril was stopped given he was not

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,

You were hospitalized due to symptoms of difficulty speaking and 
walking resulting from an ACUTE ISCHEMIC STROKE, a condition 
where a blood vessel providing oxygen and nutrients to the brain 
is blocked by a clot. The brain is the part of your body that 
controls and directs all the other parts of your body, so damage 
to the brain from being deprived of its blood supply can result 
in a variety of symptoms.
Stroke can have many different causes, so we assessed you for 
medical conditions that might raise your risk of having stroke. 
In order to prevent future strokes, we plan to modify those risk 
factors. Your risk factors are:
*smoking
*high blood pressure
*high lipids

We are changing your medications as follows:
*STOP simvastatin 40 mg daily, START taking atorvastatin 40 mg 
daily
*STOP lisinopril. Your blood pressure was not elevated while you 
were hospitalized. Your PCP may decide to resume it at your 
follow-up appointment
*DECREASE propranolol 40 mg BID to 20 mg BID 

Please take your other medications as prescribed in the 
discharge paperwork. Do not take NSAIDs such as naproxen or 
ibuprofen as you are on aspirin and Plavix, and you are at 
increased risk of bleeding.

Please follow-up with Neurology and your primary care physician 
as described below.

If you experience any of the symptoms below, please seek 
emergency medical attention by calling Emergency Medical 
Services (dialing 911). In particular, since stroke can recur, 
please pay attention to the sudden onset and persistence of 
these symptoms:
- Sudden partial or complete loss of vision
- Sudden loss of the ability to speak words from your mouth
- Sudden loss of the ability to understand others speaking to 
you
- Sudden weakness of one side of the body
- Sudden drooping of one side of the face
- Sudden loss of sensation of one side of the body

Sincerely,
Your ___ Neurology Team
