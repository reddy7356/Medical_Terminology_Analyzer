___ L-Spine MRI: Essentially normal MR lumbar spine. 
Specifically, no abnormal fluid collection, cord or cauda equina 
compression. 

___ Lumbosacral MRI: final read pending.  Prelim read--
Lack of contrast decreases the sensitivity of this study. No 
evidence of nerve  asymmetry or obstructing masses. Incompletely 
imaged enlarged uterus, expected in a post-partum patient. Mild 
decreased T1 signal in the marrow which could be seen with 
benign conditions such as chronic anemia. 
 
Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ was admitted to Labor and Delivery in active labor.  
Her labor was augmented with pitocin, and on ___ she 
underwent uncomplicated spontaneous vaginal delivery of a 3500g 
live female infant with APGAR's 9 and 9.  On postpartum day 1 
she complained of left leg pain and weakness with dorsiflexion 
and knee extension.  She was evaluated by Anesthesia, Neurology, 
and Physical Therapy.  MRI of L-spine and lumbosacral plexus did 
not show evidence of disc herniation or cauda equina 
compression, and her symptoms were attributed to nerve 
compression during labor and delivery.  Her symptoms were 
treated conservatively with lidocaine patches and heat 
compresses.  

She received fingersticks for GDMA2 until 24 hours postpartum 
and was instructed to follow up for 6 week oral glucose 
challenge.  

She was discharged on postpartum day 5 in good condition with 
outpatient follow-up scheduled.
