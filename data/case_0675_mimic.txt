None
 
History of Present Illness:
___ yo female with a history of metastatic thymic cancer s/p 
palliative chemo, stage I nonsmall cell lung cancer s/p 
Cyberknife therapy, asthma, HTN, insulin resistance presents 
with dyspnea. Patient was originally admitted to CCU, but is now 
transferred to MICU for management of suspected septic shock.  
Per the patient's record, the patient felt acute dyspnea 
yesterday evening. This episode was followed by acute chest 
discomfort located in the substernal region and was brought in 
by her son. Of note, the patient has had a recent admission for 
asthma/bronchiectasis and possible radiation pneumonitis. At 
that time she was on aztreonam and azithromycin (given 
penicillin allergy for coverage of pseudomonas) 
.  
In the ED, initial VS were HR 135 BP 155/92 O2 82% on RA. Her 
physical exam was consistent with pulmonary edema. EKG revealed 
tachycardia with aberancy (left bundle pattern) new compared to 
prior. Cardiology was consulted. Labs revealed elevated BNP at 
1381 (prior 792), trop 0.16, WBC of 13.8, normal UA. CXR 
revealed bilateral fluffly infiltrates, more dense infiltrates 
in the right upper lobe, bilateral effusions. She was given 
nitro drip, lasix, aspirin, morphine, eventually cefepime, 
vanco, methylprednisone. She was placed on CPAP however her 
symptoms did not improve. The decision was made to intubate. 
.
The ED resident had a difficult time intubating, with copious 
frothy bloody fluid from the ET tube. She had an episode of 
hypoxia while attempting to replace ET tube down to the ___. 
Eventually the patient was successfully intubated by anesthesia 
by a fiberoptic. She was given propofol during intubation and 
then sedated with fentanyl/midaz following. Initial ABG 
following intubation revealed respiratory acidosis (7.17 pCO2 65 
pO2 117 HCO3 25), however after increasing tidal volume and 
rate, ventilatory efforts have improved (pH 7.34 pCO2 32 pO2 68 
HCO3 18 with a Lactate of 5.3). 
.
There was concern for LBBB on EKG initially, but cardiology 
fellow felt this was more consistent with sinus rhythm w/ 
aberrancy. Cardiology fellow performed bedside echo which 
demonstrated globally decreased function with questionable wall 
motion abnormality of anterior and septal walls with trivial 
pericardial effusion and no impairment of the RV, new compared 
to normal echo in ___. Cardiology recommended heparin, however 
the patient has not had head imaging recently so heparin was 
held until Head CT could be performed. Prior to leaving for CT 
scanner the patient's blood pressure dropped. Despite pulmonary 
edema, the patient was given 2L IVF and started on levophed. A 
central femoral line was placed. The patient was also sent for 
Chest CT prior to arrival in the CCU. 
.
In CCU, patient started on vanc/cefepime/flagyl for pneumonia. 
She was started on vasopressin after maximal levophed.  She is 
transferred to MICU for further management of shock.
.

CXR: ___ - There are bilateral pleural effusions, right 
greater 
than left. Additionally, there is increased opacification within 
the right 
upper lobe, which is new since ___, as well as in 
bilateral 
lung bases which likely represent pneumonia. There is mild 
cardiomegaly and pulmonary edema. Sternotomy wires are midline 
and intact. 
.
CTA Chest: 1. No central pulmonary embolism. 
2. Post-radiation fibrotic changes within the right lung. 
Additionally, a 
small right-sided pleural effusion and trace left-sided pleural 
effusion is noted. Adjacent compressive atelectasis in bibasilar 
lungs is noted; 
additionally, new foci of consolidative process within bilateral 
lung bases may represent aspiration/pneumonia. 
3. No acute aortic pathology identified.

CT Head: No evidence of acute intracranial process. MRI would be 
more sensitive for metastatic disease, if indicated. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ yo female with a history of metastatic thymic cancer s/p 
palliative chemo, stage I nonsmall cell lung cancer s/p 
Cyberknife therapy, asthma, HTN, insulin resistance admitted to 
hypercarbic respiratory failure.  
.  
# Septic/Cardiogenic Shock: Strongly suspect infectious source 
of shock, given evidence of multifocal pneumonia on chest CT. 
However, concern for possible cardiac etiology as well, given 
depressed EF, though this could alternatively be due to 
myocardial stunning from sepsis. Placed on coverage for HCAP 
with meropenem/vancomycin/levaquin. Placed on coverage for PCP 
pneumonia with bactrim + steroids, and aspergillus with 
voriconazole given recent positive sputum culture and nodules on 
CT scan. Covered for Cdiff with both IV flagyl and PO vancomycin 
given history of Cdiff infection and current distended abdomen. 
The patient was started on levophed and vasopressin, as well as 
dobutamine for ionotropic effect. Cultures of sputum returned 
after the patient's passing and were (+) for MRSA, which was 
vancomycin-sensitive.
.
# Hypercarbic/Hypoxia respiratory failure: The patient has a 
history of asthma, however presentation is more consistent with 
pulmonary edema or infectious process (CT reveals bilateral 
infiltrates). She is also immunosuppressed as she has been on 
prednisone, bringing into question possible PCP ___. 
PAtient intubated and started on ARDS net protocol.
.
# Myocardial ischemia: Cardiac enzymes trending up, EF was 
___ and echo shows global hypofunction. High suspicion for 
demand ischemia/stunning in the setting of septic shock, now 
with component of cardiogenic shock as well. 
.
# Acute Renal failure: Acute increase in creatinine from 1.0 to 
2.3 with resulting hyperkalemia to 5.8. Likely in the setting of 
tissue hypoperfusion ___ shock.
.
# Anion Gap Metabolic Acidosis: Likely secondary to lactic 
acidosis and renal failure. 
.  
# Thymic cancer and NSCLC: s/p chemo for thymic cancer and 
Cyberknife for stage I NSCLC. PET from ___ shows likely 
metastatic disease in the mediastinum. The patient has had 
recurrent pleural effusions, s/p pleurodesis.  
.
A discussion was held with patient's family, and the decision 
was made to withdraw vasopressors and antimicrobial treatment. 
The patient expired at 17:51. The immediate cause of death was 
septic shock. The other causes of death included respiratory 
failure, thymic cancer, and non-small cell lung cancer. Family 
declined autopsy.

# CT ___- CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST:  There has 
been interval decrease in size of the previously seen right 
pleural effusion.  Persistent smaller right pleural effusion is 
seen with likely pleurodesis material within the pleural space. 
Additionally, more focal rounded collections are seen just 
superior to 
the liver dome, likely loculated effusions. The left lung 
appears relatively 
clear. 
  
The liver, gallbladder, spleen, splenules, adrenal glands appear 
unremarkable. The pancreas is largely fatty replaced.  Tiny 
calcification is seen in the region of the body of pancreas 
appears unchanged compared to ___.  Kidneys enhance 
symmetrically and excrete contrast bilaterally.  Tiny, rounded 
low- 
attenuation lesion is seen in the left kidney, too small to 
characterize by CT. 
  
Visualized portions of bowel appear unremarkable.  There is no 
evidence of free air or free fluid within the abdomen. 
  
CT OF THE PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST:  The rectum appears 
unremarkable.  Sigmoid diverticula are seen, without evidence of 
acute diverticulitis.  No free fluid is seen within the pelvis.  
The bladder appears unremarkable.  The uterus is absent. 
  
BONE WINDOWS:  No suspicious lytic or blastic lesions are 
identified. 
  
IMPRESSION: Interval decrease in size of right pleural effusion 
compared to prior study. Persistent small right pleural 
effusion, with loculated components seen just superior to the 
liver dome.  The extent of pleural effusions is not completely 
assessed on this study. 

CXR ___
FINDINGS: PA and lateral views of the chest are obtained. 
Midline sternotomy wires are again noted along with mediastinal 
clips. A focus of pleural nodularity is again noted along the 
lateral aspect of the right mid-lung, measuring approximately 
1.8 cm. Right-sided pleural-based opacity is similar to that 
seen previously and may represent pleural thickening and pleural 
effusion. Radiation-related changes noted along the medial 
aspect of the right lung are stable. The left lung remains 
clear. Heart size is within normal limits. No evidence of 
pneumonia or CHF. Visualized osseous structures are stable.

IMPRESSION:

Pleural-based nodule in the right upper lung appears stable. 
Right lower lung pleural thickening and effusion is also stable. 
No evidence of pneumonia or CHF.

 
Brief Hospital Course:
Pt had fever and sob, was started on cefepime empirically with 
resolution of fever. By the next morning her sob had improved.  
Films reviewed by thoracic surgery and it was felt that 
effusions were improved.  Pts symptoms most compatible with URI. 
 As she became quickly afebrile, oncololgy team recommended no 
thoracentesis to eval for infection since possible URI as 
alternative cause.

Pt switched to oral cephalosporin for possible 
tracheobronchitis, though URI also considered.  She remained 
afebrile, was dc'd home but told to return with fever, as she 
may require thoracentesis to rule out infection of pleural 
effusion.

like symptoms. CT C/A/P at that time revealed no evidence of 
PNA, and interval decrease in size of her persistent pleural 
effusions, though persistent loculation. Pt evaluated by 
thoracics who elected not to repeat tap at that time. Pt was tx 
with cefepime x1 in ___, and transitioned to cefpodoxime upon 
discharge despite apparent dx of viral URI. This was changed to 
levaquin ___ n/v. returns for evaluation of fevers.  
.  
Pt notes GI upset after her first dose of cefpodoxime, however 
first loose stool occured the following morning. She reports BMs

left upper lobe consistent with pneumonia. There was also mild 
thickening of the cecal, distal sigmoid colonic, and rectal 
walls suggestive of early inflammation, though there is not much 
surrounding fat stranding. Stool culture and c dif toxin assay 
were sent. She was given Albuterol and ipratropium nebs, Zofran,

does not radiate. She also c/o SOB. No nausea or diaphoresis. No 
improvement after Nitro x 3. Upon further interview with pt's 
family, pt and family agree that these symptoms are her classic 
reflux symptoms (pain is a burning which moves up and down her 
esophagus), and is releived with maalox.

Pertinent Results:
IMAGING:
# CXR ___: 
FINDINGS: No significant difference is seen from the prior study 
with 
persistent moderate-sized right pleural effusion and persistent 
right middle lobe opacification with volume loss as well as 
hilar predominance, likely corresponding to loculated effusion 
on CT. The left lung remains clear without effusion or focal 
opacity. Bronchiectatic changes in the right middle and lower 
lobes are again seen. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged. 
There is no change in the wedge compression fracture of the T8 
vertebral body. 
.
IMPRESSION: No interval change in the right pleural effusion, 
middle lobe and lower lobe opacification. 
.
___ CXR: 
FINDINGS: No significant interval change is seen from the prior 
study with 
persistent right effusion, middle lobe opacification, and volume 
loss with 
hilar predominance likely corresponding to loculated effusion 
and 
bronchiectasis in the right middle and lower lobes. The left 
lung is still 
well aerated.   
IMPRESSION: No interval change from the prior study without 
acute process. 
.
ECG ___: sinus, rate 97 bpm, LAD, Q in III, no acute ST/T 
change, unchange from prior

I NSCLC s/p CyberKnife, ?radiation pneumonitis, and h/o asthma 
presents with worsening wheezing despite steroids and 
antibiotics. 
. 
# Asthma exacerbation: Poor aeration on admission with diffuse 
expiratory wheezes, improved air movement w/continued end exp 
wheezes this AM. Has not been hypoxic during this admission. 
Unclear trigger for asthma exacerbation, possible infection from 
sick contact. There is no strong evidence for PE and this 
diagnosis unlikely as patient improved during the course of her 
admission. Radiation pneumonitis might be a contributing factor. 
We had the patient on standing q2H albuterol nebulizers; we had 
initially started ipratropium q6H as well, but this was 
discontinued as the patient did not feel as it is helping her 
symptoms. Pt felt that her breathing was much improved on this 
regimen, better than baseline at home prior to exacerbation. She 
was able to go q3 hours for albuterol nebs prior to discharge; 
home baseline requirement q4hrs per patient. We started patient 
on prednisone 60 mg daily and was started on a taper on 
discharge; this can be readdressed by pt's primary pulmonologist 
at the end of the month. We continued pt's home montelukast 10 
mg daily, tiotroprium. We also started empiric antibiotics with 
aztreonam and azithromycin (PCN allergy; covering Pseudomonas 
given patient's recent hospitalization); pt was discharged on  
Azithromycin 250mg by mouth daily for 2 days for a total of 5 
days. Blood and urine cultures pending, NGTD at time of 
discharge, urine analysis negative. Sputum Gram stain and 
culture preliminarily consistent w/oral flora preliminarily, 
sparse mold; likely a contaminate. Pt noted to have a elevation 
of WBC during admission, likely secondary to steroids, but we 
continued to monitor for signs of infection; pt's cough improved 
during her stay and she remained afebrile. Pt was discharged 
with continued wheezes on exam on day of discharge, but this may 
be patient's baseline as discussed with her outpatient 
pulmonologist; her ambulatory sats remained in the mid 90%s with 
a brief desat to 86%, which resolved quickly with a short break.
