Brief Hospital Course:
___ w severe dementia on hospice, glaucoma, HTN, osteoporosis, 
BPH p/w agitated dementia w/ behavioral disturbance, with course 
c/b likely iatrogenic hematuria and urinary retention, now 
resolved, as well as intermittent non-adherence to PO 
medications. 

# Encephalopathy:
# Severe dementia with behavior disturbance:
Presented from ___ (where he was on hospice for 
severe dementia) with agitation/aggression in setting of 
non-adherence to PO medications (Haldol and Depakote). Initial 
labs and imaging were otherwise largely unremarkable, without 
e/o PNA, UTI, or intoxication. NCHCT showed questionable 
mastoiditis (see below), without intracranial mass or 
hemorrhage. Likely represents progression of severe dementia, 
with possible contribution from urinary retention. In discussion 
with patient's son/HCP/legal guardian (Dr. ___, proxy 
invoked), further diagnostic workup was not within the patient's 
GOC. At HCP's request, patient was made CMO with goal of 
pursuing comfort-oriented approach to facilitate placement. He 
received haldol, olanzapine, and Depakote during prolonged ___ 
stay for agitation and aggression before finally being admitted 
to Medicine. Received loading dose of divalproex ___ mg IV x 1 on 
___ and IM Haldol decanoate 75 mg x 1 on ___ followed by 
resumption of his home PO Haldol and Depakote. He remained 
intermittently agitated and aggressive, likely in setting of 
urinary retention vs refusal of PO medications, requiring IM 
Haldol on ___ and ___ and temporary placement of soft wrist 
restraints followed by mitts to prevent harm to self and staff. 
A foley was placed ___ and restraints were d/c'd on ___. At 
the HCP's request, Foley was discontinued on ___, and patient 
was subsequently incontinent without hematuria or further 
evidence of urinary retention. Palliative care and psychiatry 
followed. At their recommendation, patient's home Haldol and 
Depakote were increased (to 7.5mg BID and 250mg BID, 
respectively) to augment the effective dose received when 
patient was amenable to taking medications. Mr. ___ 
tolerated these dose increases well with improved adherence and 
reduced agitation. Family meeting was held ___ with HCP, 
palliative care, CM, and Care ___ hospice. The patient's 
HCP confirmed Mr. ___ CMO status at that time and his 
desire to pursue outpatient hospice placement. MOLST completed - 
DNR/DNI, do not rehospitalize, no artificial nutrition. Mr. 
___ will be discharged to ___'s hospice house 
with private pay, with plan to transition to GIP at the hospice 
house when deemed eligible. Per Care ___, should patient 
develop agitation in setting of non-adherence to PO medications 
at hospice, subcutaneous Haldol can be administered in both 
scheduled and PRN fashion.

# Hematuria:
# Urinary retention:
Developed hematuria in ___ after straight cath attempt for 
urinary sample, likely iatrogenic. No e/o UTI. Resolved with 
CBI. Foley subsequently discontinued, followed by development of 
urinary retention. Plan was for intermittent straight cath, but 
patient intermittently declined, necessitating Foley replacement 
on ___ after discussion with HCP. At ___'s request, Foley was 
subsequently again d/c'd on ___, after which patient was 
incontinent without e/o recurrent hematuria or retention. 
Tamsulosin was discontinued at ___'s request. Would recommend 
bladder scans PRN at hospice for agitation or other signs of 
retention. 

# Fecal incontinence:
Baseline. Patient's HCP declined initiation of anti-diarrheal, 
and diagnostic w/u not pursued given CMO.

# HTN:
Previously on lisinopril, discontinued given CMO status at ___'s 
request. 

# Tachycardia:
# Severe malnutrition. 
Likely dehydration secondary to severe dementia and poor PO 
intake. Previously on metoprolol, discontinued on hospice prior 
to admission. IVFs and supplemental nutrition not administered 
at HCP's request given confirmed CMO.

# Possible mastoiditis:
Noted on admission NCHCT. Patient unable to endorse symptoms and 
not cooperative with exam. Given his agitation of questionable 
etiology, treated initially with 3d course of Ceftriaxone 1g 
daily for possible otitis vs. mastoiditis ___ - ___. Antibx 
subsequently discontinued at ___'s request given CMO status.

# Contacts: Dr. ___ (son/guardian, invoked); 
___

nutrition. MOLST completed ___.
