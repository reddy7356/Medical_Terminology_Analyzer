Brief Hospital Course:
The patient with metastatic pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor  was 
admitted to the HPB Surgical Service on ___ for elective 
surgical resection. On ___, the patient underwent radical 
pancreaticoduodenectomy (Whipple), left lateral hepatic 
sectionectomy and open cholecystectomy, which went well without 
complication (reader referred to the Operative Note for 
details). After a brief, uneventful stay in the PACU, the 
patient arrived on the floor NPO with an NG tube, on IV fluids, 
with a foley catheter and a JP drain x 2 in place, and epidural 
catheter for pain control. The patient was hemodynamically 
stable.
The ___ hospital course was followed the Whipple Clinical 
Pathway, his recovery was complicated by urinary tract 
infection. Post-operative pain was initially well controlled 
with epidural catheter, which was converted to oral pain 
medication when tolerating clear liquids. Patient's LFTs were 
followed daily, LFTs started to downward on POD # 2, and were 
continued to downward prior discharge. The NG tube was 
discontinued on POD# 2, and the foley catheter discontinued at 
midnight of POD# 4. The patient subsequently voided without 
problem. On POD # 4, patient spiked fever to 101.4, his blood 
and urine cultures were sent. He underwent abdominal CT scan, 
which demonstrated peripancreatic fluid collection, moderate 
ascites with some hemorrhage, no drainable collections were seen 
(see radiology report for details). Patient was started on IV 
Vancomycin and Zosyn empirically. Urine cultures were positive 
for Enterococcus and he was continued on IV antibiotics. 
Sensitivity came back on POD # 8, and patient's antibiotics were 
changed to PO Augmentin. His WBC started to downward and fever 
subsided. The patient was started on sips of clears on POD# 6, 
which was progressively advanced as tolerated to a regular diet 
by POD# 8.  JP amylase was sent in the evening of  POD# 7; the 
JP was discontinued on POD# 9 as the output and amylase level 
were low.
During this hospitalization, the patient ambulated early and 
frequently, was adherent with respiratory toilet and incentive 
spirrometry, and actively participated in the plan of care. The 
patient received subcutaneous heparin and venodyne boots were 
used during this stay. The patient's blood sugar was monitored 
regularly throughout the stay; sliding scale  insulin was 
administered when indicated. 
At the time of discharge on ___, the patient was doing 
well, afebrile with stable vital signs.  The patient was 
tolerating a regular diet, ambulating, voiding without 
assistance, and pain was well controlled.  Staples were removed, 
and steri-strips placed. The patient was discharged home with 
___ services for wound checks. The patient received discharge 
teaching and follow-up instructions with understanding 
verbalized and agreement with the discharge plan.

Chief Complaint:
Abdominal Pain
 
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
EGD
 
History of Present Illness:
Mr. ___ is a ___ man with history of neuroendocrine 
tumor s/p Whipple and partial hepatectomy, seronegative 
arthropathy presenting with abdominal pain.

The patient reports that he has had abdominal pain since his 
surgery. Over the years, he has had several episodes of acute on 
chronic abdominal pain. About a year ago while in ___, he 
reports that he had debilitating abdominal pain and "diaphgram 
seizures" where he felt like he was suffocating. The pain is 
upper abdomen, primarily epigastric, it does not radiate, no 
relationship to foods (not exacerbated or alleviated by foods). 
He previously kept a diary for over a year and could not 
identify any exacerbating or alleviating factors for his pain.

Over the past ___ weeks he has had worsening epigastric 
abdominal pain. No radiation. As previously, no exacerbating or 
alleviating factors. No nausea, vomiting, changes in bowel 
habits. No fevers or chills. No heartburn or dysphagia. He took 
the dilaudid that he is prescribed, which did not help the pain. 
He presented to his gastroenterologist today for this pain, and 
was referred to ED.

In the ED, vitals: 7 97.8 65 129/88 14 100% RA 
Exam: Abdomen soft, nontender, nondistended.
Labs: WBC 8.3, Hb 12.5; BMP wnl; LFTs including lipase wnl; 
methotrexate ___ <0.04
Imaging:
- EKG: Sinus bradycardia at 58 bpm, LAD, NI, submm-STE in I, 
aVL, V5, V6, consistent with prior
- CT A/P with IV and PO contrast: 
1. No acute intra-abdominal or intrapelvic process which would 
correlate with patient's reported symptoms. No evidence for 
recurrent malignancy.
2. Status post left hepatectomy and Whipple procedure with 
associated postsurgical changes.
Patient given:
___ 15:20 IV Morphine Sulfate 2 mg 
___ 15:20 IV Ondansetron 4 mg 
___ 21:22 IV Morphine Sulfate 2 mg

Of note, patient seen in ___ in liver clinic with persistent 
abdominal pain, thought to possible be due to neuropathic pain. 
Prior abdominal imaging MRI showed persistent patchy enhancement 
throughout the right lobe of the liver compatible with mild 
persistent secondary sclerosing cholangitis, and patient is at 
risk for developing secondary biliary cirrhosis. LFTs checked at 
that visit were unremarkable, and ___ was negative.

On arrival to the floor, the patient reports that his pain is 
improved from an ___ to a ___. He tells me that multiple pain 
medications have been trialed in the past; most narcotics give 
him severe nausea. However, low doses of liquid Dilaudid or IV 
morphine are tolerable and seem to help his pain. He has 
previously also tried muscle relaxants given the spasmodic 
quality to the pain, but these did not help. He has no other 
complaints at present.

ROS: Pertinent positives and negatives as noted in the HPI.  All 
other systems were reviewed and are negative.

# ABDOMINAL PAIN
# HISTORY OF NEUROENDOCRINE TUMOR
# SECONDARY SCLEROSING CHOLANGITIS
Longstanding intermittent symptom since surgery in ___. 
Previous evaluation has been largely unremarkable, and CT A/P in 
the ED without acute process. Labs largely unremarkable. EGD 
unremarkable for source of pain. Suspect that this represents 
neuropathic pain in the setting of prior surgery. The patient 
was instructed to f/u in the pain clinic as scheduled.

# LIGHTHEADEDNESS: Complained of mild dizziness with standing, 
particularly on the day of his EGD. Orthostatics negative. 
Suspect that this was related to mild volume depletion in the 
setting of prolonged NPO status as well as possible pain 
medication effect and/or effect of ramelteon (pt reported that 
symptoms started after getting ramelteon). Symptoms largely 
resolved by the time of discharge.

# SERONEGATIVE ARTHROPATHY: Continued home medications.

# RAYNAUDS: No acute issues.

# GERD: On PPI
