and erythema overlying her right shin concerning for cellulitis. 


Active Issues: 
================
# Acute on chronic diastolic heart failure
Patient with a history of HFpEF with recent TTE from ___ 
demonstrating EF of 55-60% with LVH and moderate pulm HTN. 
Developed weight gain and worsening dyspnea in the setting of 
holding ___ at last admission. On admission, her weight was 
190lbs and she had dyspnea at rest requiring 4L O2 (she required 
3L O2 last discharge) and desats to 60-70s on ambulation. She 
was started on furosemide gtt, eventually uptitrated to 20mg/hr, 
with weight decrease to ***171.3lbs***, decreased O2 requirement 
to 2L, and stable Cr at 1.1. She was then switched to torsemide 
100mg PO once daily, tolerating well.

# Acute hypoxic respiratory failure: 
Home ___ requirement is 3L. At ___, 4L O2 requirement and 
desaturates to 60-70% O2 with ambulation. This apparently was 
chronic although likely acutely worsened in the setting of 
volume overload. CXR was fairly unremarkable and already on 
anticoagulation. Had declined OSA evaluation in the past. She 
was diuresed with improvement in resting and ambulatory O2 sats 
as well as dyspnea. Her O2 was weaned down to home level of ___ 
NC.

# R ___ cellulitis:
Patient had a 1 week history of right lower extremity erythema 
s/p treatment with cephalexin and levofloxacin, ultimately 
discontinued as felt not to be a true infection. On admission, 
she had R > L erythema although without leukocytosis or warmth. 
Empirically treated cellulitis with ceftriaxone 1g q24h for 7 
day treatment course (___).

#Atrial Fibrillation: CHADs2 of 4. With EKG in clinic consistent 
with AFib. She was continued on home apixaban at 5mg BID and 
home metoprolol 12.5 mg XL daily

#Diarrhea: She had diarrhea on admission in the setting of 
recent antibiotics and recent constipation with treatment with 
magnesium citrate. C. diff was held off as it resolved.

CHRONIC ISSUES:
===============
#Lung nodule

lobe is concerning for primary lung malignancy. Single enlarged 
anterior mediastinal lymph node is also concerning.  Plan for 
PET-CT or short-term follow-up CT chest in ___ weeks from 
___

#CAD: Continued home atorvastatin 80mg daily. Started ASA 81 as 
unclear why she was not on it at home.

#Low back pain: Continued acetaminophen prn with home vicodin 
prn for breakthrough

#Rectal pain: Continued home suppositories

#Peripheral neuropathy: Continued home gabapentin 

#COPD: Patient has reported history of COPD, however her recent 
PFTs argue for a restrictive pattern and she has no smoking 
history. She was continued on albuterol PRN Q6 hours and Advair 
while inpatient as symbicort was non-formulary.

#DMII: Continued home glargine 25 U at bedtime. Held home 
sitagliptin and started on HISS while inpatient.

# Pulmonary HTN on 3L O2
Initial standing weight on admission was 171.5 lbs, her BNP 
above baseline, and exam was concerning for volume overload. 
Found to also have UTI, which in combination with under-dosing 
of torsemide at home likely triggered her acute decompensation. 
She was diuresed with BID IV lasix, and her metoprolol was 
continued. She diuresed over 8 L during the admission, with 
improvement of her oxygen requirement to 2L. Discharge weight 
was 163.14 and discharge Creatinine was 1.1.

# UTI: 
Patient presented with dysuria and frequency along with positive 
UA. Urine culture grew Aerococcus urinae, which is a rare cause 
of UTI, but can cause bacteraemia/septicaemia and/or 
endocarditis. Per micro lab, sensitivities on aerococcus urinae 
are not routinely performed because they are a sendout lab. 
Treatment with beta-lactam antibiotics is recommended, as A 
urinae is frequently resistant to sulfonamides and 
fluoroquinolones ___: ___. She was initially treated 
with vancomycin and ceftriaxone, as her blood cultures were 
growing GPCs. However this was narrowed to ceftriaxone when the 
blood stream resulted with S bovis (see below), as per 
infectious disease, both A urinae and S bovis are sensitive to 
ceftriaxone. She completed seven day course of abx, ___ - ___.

# Strep bovis Bacteremia: 
Patient with strep in ___ blood cultures, one bottle, no clear 
source for strep bacteremia as urine growing Aerococcus urinae. 
Speciated as strep bovis, which is sensitive to ceftriaxone. No 
clear recommendations on duration of therapy, so treated for 7 
days, last day ___. 

# Left eye hordeolum 
# Bacterial conjunctivitis
History of macular degeneration in left eye (legally blind) and 
history of ocular HSV per patient. Presented with pain due to 
stye in her left eye, then with itching and redness, no pain 
with eye movement. Likely bacterial infection, completed 
erythromycin for 5 day course with resolution of symptoms.

HYDROcodone-Acetaminophen (5mg-325mg) 1 TAB PO Q6H:PRN Pain, and 
replaced with separate oxycodone and acetaminophen (formulary). 

# GERD
Continued Omeprazole 20 mg PO DAILY 

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES
===================
---Discharge weight 74.0 kg (163.14 lbs) 
---Discharge creatinine 1.1
---Discharge potassium 4.0
[] Patient had bacteremia with strep bovis, which is associated 
with colorectal cancer, consider colonoscopy as outpatient if 
within goals of care.
[] Patient's oxygen requirement decreased with diuresis 
(requiring 2L on discharge). Consider downtitrating as an 
outpatient to avoid over-diuresis
[] Patient's dose of torsemide was increased on discharge. 
Recommend follow-up BMP on discharge to ensure stable Creatinine 
and potassium. She was also discharged with potassium 
supplement.

This patient was prescribed, or continued on, an opioid pain 
medication at the time of discharge (please see the attached 
medication list for details). As part of our safe opioid 
prescribing process, all patients are provided with an opioid 
risks and treatment resource education sheet and encouraged to 
discuss this therapy with their outpatient providers to 
determine if opioid pain medication is still indicated.

treated with antibiotics to kill the bacteria. 
- You had a painful stye and an infection in your eye 
("bacterial conjunctivitis"). You were given antibiotics in an 
ointment and this improved. 

WHAT SHOULD I DO AFTER I LEAVE THE HOSPITAL?  
-Please continue to take all of your medications and follow-up 
with your appointments as listed below.
-Your dose of torsemide was increased during this 
hospitalization to 100 mg daily. Please ensure you are taking 
this dosage unless instructed otherwise by your doctors. 
-___ were started on potassium 20 mg to take daily. Please 
ensure you are taking this medication unless instructed 
otherwise by your doctors.

Ms. ___ is a ___ w/ h/o COPD on 3L O2, a fib on warfarin, CAD
s/p CABG, HFpEF, IDDM, HLD, and obesity who presented to the ED
with increasing shortness of breath. 

The patient reports that she has been having increasing SOB over
the several days. Specifically, she notes that her breathing
becomes labored with movement or prolonged conversation. Over 
the
course of the week, she has been increasing her oxygen from her
baseline 3L to 5L/day. She denies any chest pain, fever, chills,
cough or increased sputum production. Her ___ is about at 
baseline
and she denies any weight gain. No chest pain, palpitations or
PND. She sleeps upright at baseline but does not have an
increased pillow requirement at night. Given persistence of her
symptoms and generalized malaise this morning, she presented to
the ED for further management.

No evidence of deep venous thrombosis in the right or left lower 
extremity 
veins.  Slightly limited views of the bilateral calf veins due 
to body 
habitus. 

CT CHEST W/O CONTRAST ___:
FINDINGS:  
  
LOWER NECK: Unremarkable 
  
AIRWAYS/LUNGS: 
There is mild bilateral lobe terminal bronchiectasis with areas 
of mucous 
plugging. 
Assessment of the lung parenchyma is slightly degraded by motion 
artifact.  
There is mild diffuse interlobular septal thickening 
predominantly in the 
dependent portions of the lungs bilaterally.  Patchy 
ground-glass opacities 
are noted in the lower lobes.  There is bibasilar subsegmental 
atelectasis.  
There is no focal airspace consolidation. 
There is a 15 mm nodule in the periphery of the apicoposterior 
segment of the 
left upper lobe (series 5, image 43).  Additional subcentimeter 
nodules are 
also seen measuring 2 mm in the left lung apex (series 5, image 
24), 7 mm 
pulmonary nodule in the apex of the right upper lobe (series 5, 
image 53) and 
5 mm nodule slightly more anteriorly in the right apex (series 
5, image 54).

suggestive of mild interstitial pulmonary edema.  Patchy 
ground-glass opacities in the lower lobes are nonspecific but 
could be seen with alveolar edema. 
2. 15 mm nodule in the apicoposterior segment of the left upper 
lobe is 
concerning for primary lung malignancy.  Single enlarged 
anterior mediastinal lymph node is also concerning.  Consider 
PET-CT or short-term follow-up CT chest in ___ weeks. 
3. Additional subcentimeter pulmonary nodules as described can 
also be 
reassessed on follow-up. 
4. Mild bilateral lower lobe bronchiectasis with areas of mucous 
plugging.

Brief Hospital Course:
SUMMARY:
___ w/ h/o COPD on 3L O2, a fib on warfarin, CAD s/p CABG, 
HFpEF,
IDDM, HLD, and obesity who presented to the ED with increasing
shortness of breath. 

ACTIVE ISSUES:
#Acute on chronic hypoxic respiratory failure
#Dyspnea 
#HFpEF exacerbation 
Highest suspicion for mild HFpEF exacerbation given BNP 3000 and 
elevated JVP and rales on examination. CXR without acute process 
and patient denies any fevers, chills, increased sputum 
production or cough making COPD exacerbation less likely. 
Unclear trigger of possible HFpEF exacerbation as patient states 
she has
been taking her medications as prescribed and has had stable 
weights (possibly losing weight). No infectious signs or 
symptoms. During admission she was on her home O2 requirement 
and feeling improved though she continued to have ambulatory 
oxygen destaturations to mid ___ on 3L. A TTE was performed 
which showed mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with 
normal cavity size and global biventricular systolic function. 
Right ventricular cavity dilation with mild free wall 
hypokinesis and moderate pulmonary artery hypertension. Moderate 
aortic valve stenosis with moderately thickened leaflets. These 
findings bring question as to whether underlying pulmonary HTN 
or AS which was newly discovered this admission could be 
contributing to presentation. Question of thrombo-embolic 
disease has been considered, LENIs performed and with no 
evidence of DVT (and patient has been on warfarin, though 
frequently subtherapeutic). She also has a reported history of 
COPD, but no prior PFTs could be located. She was diuresed with 
Bumex 1 mg daily and then IV lasix 80 mg. She has mild ___ as 
below. She was continued on Bumex 2 mg daily as a diuretic 
regimen for discharge. 

#HFpEF: 
LVEF >55%. On bumex 2mg daily and metolazone prn for weight 
gain.
During admission appeared overloaded as detailed above. She was 
on carvedilol as a recent medication change at home which was 
transitioned to metoprolol for less of a blood pressure effect 
given soft to normotension this admission. She was discharged on 
a Bumex 2 mg for diuretic regimen. She was maintained on a low 
Na diet and 2L fluid restriction. Her weight on discharge is 
81.24 kg (179.1 lb). 

#Pulmonary HTN
Newly discovered on echo this admission. Etiology unclear and 
likely multifactorial (underlying pulmonary disease or 
thromboembolic disease or related to heart failure). CT chest 
showed mild pulmonary edema but no evidence of interstitial lung 
disease. She has listed a history of COPD but no wheezing was 
noted on exam. She is scheduled to follow up with pulmonologist. 


#Aortic stenosis 
New on echo this admission. Valve area 1.1cm². Unclear if 
contributing to dyspnea. 
She is scheduled to follow up with cardiologist. 

___ 
Patient with mild elevation in serum Cr to 1.3 up from baseline 
of ~0.8. Likely in setting of diuresis. Cr improved to 1.0 and 
then again rose to 1.2 at time of discharge in setting of 
diuresis with 1mg Bumex and IV Lasix 80mg. She was continued on 
Bumex 2 mg daily as diuretic regimen for discharge. She will 
need repeat serum chemistries and electrolytes checked within 1 
week of discharge. 

#COPD:
On 3L NC at home. Currently without signs or symptoms of acute 
exacerbation and held off on further steroids during this 
admission. Unclear etiology of diagnosis, patient was never a 
smoker. Transitionally patient should have PFTs as outpatient. 

#Atrial Fibrillation:
CHAD2-4 on warfarin for anticoagulation at home. Recently 
transitioned from atenolol to metoprolol during last admission 
for rate control and then switched recently to carvedilol at 
home. Will continue metoprolol 12.5mg XL. INR was subtherapeutic 
on admission and has been uptitrated as outpatient. Given 
frequently sub-therapeutic INR it was decided to initiate 
abixiban 5mg BID for anticoagulation. 

#Lung nodule 
15 mm nodule in the apicoposterior segment of the left upper 
lobe
is concerning for primary lung malignancy. Single enlarged
anterior mediastinal lymph node is also concerning. 
- Transtional issue for PET-CT or short-term follow-up CT chest 
in ___ weeks. 

#Leukocytosis 
Patient with mildly elevated leukocytosis. Has been fluctuating
during admission. Patient asymptomatic without evidence of
infection. 

CHRONIC ISSUES: 
=============== 
#IDDM
-ISS 
-Glargine 30U qhs 

#Low back pain 
On Norco for pain at home
-Continued acetaminophen prn
-Continued oxycodone prn for breakthrough

#Hypertension
-Recently on carvedilol at home. 
- Restarted metoprolol for less blood pressure effect. 

#CAD s/p CABG
-Continued home atorvastatin and aspirin

#Peripheral neuropathy
-Continued home gabapentin 
-Oxycodone prn for breakthrough
-Trialed capsacin topically

#GERD
-Continued home omeprazole 

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: 
=====================

MED CHANGES:
-Warfarin changed to apixiban for her atrial fibrillation / 
stroke prevention. If renal function were to worsen in the 
future might qualify for reduced dose apixiban.
-Discharged on metoprolol rather than carvedilol as patient had 
lower BPs while inpatient. 
- Potassium supplementation not required this admission. Was 
previously on 20mg TID. Will be discharge on 40 mg daily. Should 
check serum chemistries within 1 week of discharge and 
re-evaluate dosage of potassium supplementation. 

Other transitional issues:
[ ] Discharge weight: 81.24 kg (179.1 lb). 
[ ] Patient found to have 15 mm lung nodule and mediastinal 
lymphadenopathy. She will need PET-CT or short-term follow-up CT 
chest in ___ weeks.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ is an ___ yo female with hx of CAD s/p CABG and 
stenting, HTN, Afib on coumadin, IDDM, COPD on 3L home O2, and 
HFpEF presenting with 3 days of increasing shortness of breath, 
presentation consistent with CHF exacerbation after dietary 
indiscretion.

#SOB
#Acute on chronic HFpEF
___ presented with several days of SOB and a minor step up 
in O2 requirement (3->4L) after eating a salty ___ dinner at 
her ___ birthday party on ___. On presentation, 
she appeared to be volume overloaded on exam with JVD to the 
mandible, 2+ bilateral pitting edema and mild bilateral 
crackles. ProBNP elevated with cardiomegaly on CXR, confirming 
HF. Mild leukocytosis resolved within 24 hours (13 -> 9.8). 
Troponins neg, and lactate WNL. Treated with IV Azithromycin 500 
mg x1 and Duo nebs in the ED for concern for COPD. Bumex held 
initially, however ___ was given Colace for constipation 
with good effect, and showed improvement in her breathing, lung 
exam, and return to baseline O2 requirement without diuretics. 
Given improvement, restarted home Bumex 2 mg PO with home 
metolazone (taken as a PRN for weight at home) with close 
monitoring of daily standing weights. Bumex held on HD3-5 for 
rise in creatinine concerning for ___. Home atenolol was 
transitioned to fractionated metoprolol given mild bump in 
creatinine prior to diuresis. Close monitoring of electrolytes 
and renal function throughout diuresis with repletion of 
electrolytes as needed. 

___
Creatinine began rising with re-initiation of home Bumex and 
home Metolazone (taken monthly at home for elevated weights). On 
HD3, Crea up to 1.4 (1.1 admission) and weight down 6 lbs., 
though euvolemic on exam. Bumex held on ___ for presumed 
prerenal azotemia. Home metoprolol was fractionated and held for 
systolic < 100 and 60
#COPD
___ presenting with diffuse wheezes. Treated with 
Azithromycin 500 mg x1 and duo nebs x1 in the ED. Although she 
presented with SOB, no cough or sputum changes, and relatively 
abrupt change in breathing gave low suspicion for COPD 
exacerbation. Home PRN albuterol inhaler continued. 

#Afib
#subtherapeutic warfarin
EKG notable for irregularly irregular rhythm on admission, 
consistent with
known history of Afib. Rate stable. On Coumadin for 
anticoagulation (CHAD2 =4). INR 1.6 on presentation, 1.7 
following AM. Coumadin initially uptitrated to 3mg, however, INR 
was 2.3 on HD3, and Coumadin was down-titrated back to 2 mg. 
___ trended throughout admission, and was therapeutic on 
admission. Home Atenolol transitioned to fractionated Metoprolol 
in-house for creatinine bump. Return to baseline Coumadin dose 
of 2mg/1mg alternating. 

#Constipation
In the ED, ___ noted last bowel movement was 4 days prior to 
admission. Treated with increased bowel regimen to good effect. 
Constipation continued to be treated throughout admission. Of 
note, she is also taking opioids for pain control.

#R Foot Pain
___ complaining of on-going foot on ball of right foot that 
limits ambulation. Daughter reports foot pain has been ongoing 
and prompted an ED visit to ___ in early ___. 
Review of ___ foot radiographs significant for osteophyte 
but no fracture. ___ has ongoing ___ at home for pain. While 
inpatient was treated with analgesics for pain. A AP/Lat/Oblique 
of the right foot was significant for faint lucency along medial 
aspect of the second toe proximal phalanx base that represents a 
nondisplaced fracture. Podiatry was consulted and recommended 
surgical boot with pain management with f/u outpatient to assess 
mobility limitations. 

CHRONIC ISSUES: 
=============== 
#IDDM
Oral anti-glycemics held. Nighttime glargine insulin decreased 
to 25U at bed time in house + sliding scale with meals. 

#Low back pain 
Home oxycodone 5mg Q4H PRN and acetaminophen 650 mg Q8H PRN 
continued. Oxycodone limited for sedation. 

#Hypertension
Home atenolol transitioned to 6.25 mg PO metoprolol q6H. 
Hemodynamically stable throughout admission. 

#CAD
-Continued on home atorvastatin, aspirin

#Peripheral neuropathy
-Continued on home gabapentin

#GERD
-Continued on home omeprazole 

Transitional Issues:
=====================
[] consider transitioning to a NOAC from warfarin since the 
___ is often not therapeutic
[] please continue to assess foot pain- ___ xray showed 
nondisplaced fracture which would be treated with immobolization 
via surgical boot. F/u w/ podiatry as outpatient. ___ consider 
adding NSAID anti-inflammatories if creatinine normalizes. ___ 
have neuropathic component ___ DM, can also consider uptitrating 
gabapentin

every other day during the week of ___ and decide if bumex 1mg 
every other day is a good regimen; ___ is sensitive to her 
diuretics
[] continue to check INR daily and dose warfarin accordingly
[] please monitor blood pressures on metoprolol (new 
medication), consider transitioning to 25mg metoprolol XL daily 
if blood pressures stable. Low threshold to hold metoprolol for 
soft pressures.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,

Why did you come to the hospital?
-You came to the hospital because you were feeling short of 
breath. 
-We found a lot of fluid in your lungs and your legs that we 
think made you feel short of breath.
-You also were found to have constipation. 
-We also noticed that the dose of your blood thinning 
medication, Coumadin, was not quite high enough to treat your 
Afib. 
-You came in with some right foot pain. 

What did we do for you while you were at the hospital?
-We gave you your home medicine Bumex for your heart failure, as 
well as the metolazone medication, which you take sometimes for 
your heart failure.
-We watched your weight and how much you urinated to make sure 
that you peed off the extra fluid in your lungs.
-We decreased your Bumex to 1 mg every day vs every other day. 
We were very careful with how much of your Bumex we gave you 
because you are very sensitive to it. 
-We gave you medicines for your constipation. You felt much 
better after taking these medications. 
-We realized that your dose of your blood thinning medication, 
Coumadin, was not high enough. 
-We increased it, and watched your blood tests to make sure you 
were getting the right amount of Coumadin. 
-We switched your atenolol to metoprolol, which is another 
medication for your Afib that is a little bit nicer for your 
kidneys.
-We treated your foot pain with pain medications. 
-We got a picture of your foot. It showed chronic changes that 
could cause you discomfort but did not show any large fracture 
that we could fix.
-The Podiatrists (foot doctors) came to see you. They would like 
to see you when you leave the hospital to try to help you with 
your foot pain. 

What should you do when you go home?
-Continue to weigh yourself every day. If you have >3 lbs of 
weight gain in 1 day, call your doctor.
-___ to eat a low salt (<2g/day)/low sugar diet.
-Continue to take the lower dose of your Bumex (1mg) every day. 
Take your metolazone if your weight increases quickly or if you 
feel very short of breath. Call you doctor if this happens.
-You may not need 3L of oxygen at home. Check your 
pulse-oximeter, because 2L may be enough.
-Continue to take your new metoprolol medication. 
-Visit your podiatrist for your foot pain. 
-Continue to wear your surgical shoe and your lidocaine patches 
so that you can walk and continue working on getting stronger. 

It was a pleasure taking care of you during your admission at 
___.

In the ED, initial vitals were  98.1 94 139/74 16 100% 4L
 
Past Medical History:
Cardiac Risk Factors: DM, Dyslipidemia, Hypertension  
.  
Cardiac History:  
s/p MI ___: 3.0X13mm stent to mLAD, 2.5X13mm stent to pLCX  
CABG, in ___ anatomy as follows: LIMA to LAD, SVG to rPDA, rPL 
(sequential grafting)  
.  
Percutaneous coronary intervention ___ with 2x more recent 
caths): 
1. Coronary arteriography in this right dominant system revealed 
two 
vessel disease. The LMCA was calcified with a 30% ostial 
stenosis. The mid LAD had a 80% stenosis which was also 
calcified. The D1 and D2 arteries were both small. The D2 artery 
had a 60% ostial stenosis. The LCx was subtotally occluded in 
its mid portion. Distal to the occlusion collaterals were seen 
filling the distal LCx and OM1 from the RCA.The RCA was a large 
vessel with some mild luminal irregularities in the mid and 
distal portions. 
2. Resting hemodynamics were performed for the left side and 
revealed LV pressures of 170/14 mmHg. The elevated LVEDP in a 
patient with a normal end diastolic volume index is consistent 
with minimal to mild diastolic dysfunction. There was no 
pressure gradient measured across the aortic valve. 
3. Left ventriculography revealed anterolateral akinesis and 
apical 
hypokinesis. The calculated LVEF was 53%. No mitral 
regurgitation was 
seen. 
4. Successful stenting of the mid LCx with a 2.25x13mm Bx 
Velocity 
stent and stenting of the mid LAD with a 3.0x13mm Bx Velocity 
stent each with 0% residual stenosis. 
  
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:     
1. Two vessel coronary artery disease. 
2. Mild diastolic ventricular dysfunction. 
3. Successful stenting of the mid LCx and mid LAD.

DISCHARGE LABS:
================
MICROBIOLOGY:
Blood culture x2 ___: No growth (final)
Urine culture ___: No growth (final)
================
IMAGING:
CTA HEAD/NECK ___:
1. No evidence of acute infarction, hemorrhage or intracranial 
mass. 
2. Approximately 70-75% stenosis of both proximal internal 
carotid arteries by NASCET criteria. 
3. Mild and moderate stenosis at the origins of the great 
vessels and right vertebral artery origin. 
4. 3 mm left apical pulmonary nodule, unchanged from ___.  A six-month follow-up CT chest was recommended at that 
time point for close follow-up evaluation, which would have been 
due in ___. 

CT A/P with contrast (___): No acute abnormality in the abdomen 
or pelvis to explain patient's acute symptoms. No bowel 
obstruction. Mild intra and extrahepatic biliary ductal dilation 
is unchanged from ___ and presumably related to 
cholecystectomy. The kidneys are of normal and symmetric size 
with normal nephrogram. 

CXR (___): Comparison to ___. Stable alignment of 
the sternal wires. Stable mild enlargement of the cardiac 
silhouette. The left lung basis shows a parenchymal opacity that 
might reflect a combination of pneumonia and pleural effusion. 
No pulmonary edema. Unremarkable alignment of the sternal wires. 


CT CHEST/ABD/PELVIS WITHOUT CONTRAST ___:
1. 1.1 cm subpleural nodule with the left upper lobe and 0.5 cm 
nodule in the right upper lobe are unchanged compared to ___ imaging surveillance is recommended in 6 months 
to ___ year. 
2. Unchanged 1.4 cm enlarged para-aortic lymph node. 
3. Reticular opacities in bilateral lung bases are likely 
reflect interstitial lung disease.  The finding is more 
prominent compared to ___, likely with some 
superimposed atelectasis. 
4. Contrast retention in bilateral kidneys are consistent with 
history of 
acute renal failure. 
RECOMMENDATION(S):   Continued CT surveillance of the pulmonary 
nodules in 6 months to ___ year. 

TTE ___:
Suboptimal image quality. No obvious vegetations, but cannot 
exclude due to image quality. Mild symmetric left ventricular 
hypertrophy with low normal global systolic function. Right 
ventricular cavity dilation and hypokinesis. Severe aortic valve 
stenosis. At least mild-moderate
mitral regurgitation. Mild-moderate tricuspid regurgitation and 
severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. If clinically 
suggested, the absence of a discrete vegetation on 
echocardiography does not exclude the diagnosis of endocarditis. 
Compared with the prior TTE (images not available for review) of 
___ , the severity of aortic
stenosis is now increased. The severity of pulmonary 
hypertension has increased.

CT HEAD WITHOUT CONTRAST ___:
No gross intracranial hemorrhage on severely limited exam. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ is a ___ woman with chronic atrial 
fibrillation (on apixaban), moderate aortic stenosis, coronary 
artery disease s/p stents to LAD, LCx, and
CABG ___ (LIMA-LAD, SVG-RPDA-PL), COPD with pulmonary 
hypertension on 3L home O2, heart failure with preserved EF, DM 
type II, who presented with several weeks of increasing lethargy 
and weakness. She was found to have persistent and slightly
worsening left lower lobe lung infiltrate (from ___ 
consistent with likely pneumonia.  Her hospital course has been 
complicated by acute renal failure, which is slowly improving 
and likely due to CIN.  Her course has also been complicated by 
acute encephalopathy, likely due in part to status epilepticus. 
However, her mental status was not significantly improving 
despite improved EEG on anti-epileptic therapy and empiric 
antibiotic and antiviral therapy for encephalitis.  Ultimately, 
I had a family meeting with the patient's son and daughter, as 
well as palliative care and neurology on ___ and her family 
decided to transition her to comfort measures only.  She was 
discharged to ___ facility in ___.

ACUTE/ACTIVE PROBLEMS:
# Comfort measures only:
- Discontinued all medications except PRN nebs.  She was on 
Keppra and Valproic acid to help prevent seizures for comfort 
and on discharge, will switch to PRN Ativan.  She had PRN IV 
Dilaudid for pain and Haldol for agitation.  Regular diet was 
allowed for pleasure.  Palliative care was following and then 
she was seen by ___.

# Status epilepticus: Continuous EEG was consistent with status 
epilepticus. Received loading 1500 of valproate and 1 of Ativan. 
Per neuro could be due to underlying encephalopathy plus 
antibiotics reducing seizure threshold, but also could be 
primary neurologic process (infectious vs inflammatory vs 
paraneoplastic)
going on for months that has been worsening in the past week. 
She had normal TSH.  LP was NOT within goals of care, 
extensively discussed with daughter, so she was empirically 
given Ampicillin and Acyclovir, which were stopped on ___ 
when she was changed to CMO.  On ___, discussed with 
neurologist who read her EEG and reported that she was still 
having discharge but improved since starting Keppra.  EEG was 
stopped on ___ and she was continued on IV Valproic acid 
(since ___ and Keppra 250mg BID (since ___ until discharged 
on ___.  As discussed with palliative, neurology, and the 
patient's daughter, she was not discharged on scheduled Keppra 
and Valproic acid, but will have PRN Ativan if overt signs of 
seizure or discomfort.

# Lethargy:
# Leukocytosis:
# LLL lung infiltrate: Patient presented with lethargy, 
confusion and report of abdominal pain and vomiting, plus 
leukocytosis, suspect symptoms due to infection. Urinalysis with 
26 WBC but urine culture negative, so unlikely to be UTI. 
Unclear if patient has respiratory complaints and oxygen 
requirement is at baseline, but CXR with left-sided 
consolidation was concerning for possible pneumonia. She also 
had a consolidation in the same spot on last chest x-ray in 
___. CT scan did not
show significant pneumonia. Blood and urine cultures had no 
growth. WBC was rising while on antibiotics, but resolved, and 
she has been afebrile.  ID was consulted.  She was on empiric 
Zosyn, Azithromycin, Vancomycin, then changed to 
Ceftazidime/Azithromycin for several days, stopped ___. 
Discontinued empiric IV Acyclovir and Ampicillin (___) for 
encephalitis coverage since CMO.

# Toxic-metabolic encephalopathy: CT head without contrast on 
___ showed no acute abnormalities, though limited study.  
Concern for possible encephalitis given altered mental status, 
so per discussion with ID on ___, she was empirically started 
on IV ampicillin to cover for Listeria and Acyclovir for HSV 
coverage,
since she has previously insisted she would not want an LP and 
confirmed with her daughter. Her encephalopathy was likely in 
part due to seizures in setting of renal failure, possible 
initial infection, and chronic atrophy. Mental status had not
significantly improved despite improvement on EEG after 
anti-epileptic therapy was started or after being on empiric 
antiviral/antibiotic therapy.  Prognosis was discussed with 
neurology who discussed with the family that she could have 
neurologic recovery, but likely would be a prolonged process 
given significant chronic brain atrophy and her age and that she 
had been in status epilepticus.  Ultimately her family felt she 
would not want to go through a long recovery and would rather be 
made comfortable, so further workup and management was stopped.

# Acute renal failure on chronic kidney disesase stage III: 
# Metabolic acidosis
# Hyperphosphatemia:
Recent baseline Cr 1.1-1.2; 1.7 on admission and increased very 
quickly up to 3.8. Still making urine.  Most likely due to CIN 
in setting of contrast given for CT scans. Had wanted to give 
sodium bicarb BID - but she could not take oral and IV is on 
severe shortage. Held home torsemide given not eating/drinking 
and did not appear hypervolemic.  Renal was following. Her renal 
function was gradually improving.

# Chronic hypoxic respiratory failure: On 3L NC chronically.
# Chronic diastolic congestive heart failure: LVEF 55-60%
# Pulmonary HTN, COPD on 3L O2 (home requirement): Pro-BNP was 
elevated to 3285 but has been chronically elevated, with no 
evidence of pulmonary edema. However, creatinine was rising off 
diuretics after bolus in ED.  Stable on ___ NC. Her home 
torsemide, metoprolol, spironolactone were held during hospital 
course and on discharge.

# Hyponatremia: Likely was due to torsemide, which was held, and 
resolved.
# Hypernatremia: She developed hypernatremia to 149 on ___, 
likely in setting of being NPO and not being on IV fluids and 
worsened to 155 on ___, so had started on D5W.  Discontinued D5W 
and all labs since CMO.

# Hypokalemia: K was low at 3.3 and ordered for repletion on 
___, but discontinued monitoring since CMO.

CHRONIC/STABLE PROBLEMS:
# CAD s/p CABG: TTE was not significantly changed. Held 
ASA/statin/beta-blocker since not taking orals and will not 
restart since CMO.

# HTN: Held home Metoprolol while NPO --> will not resume since 
CMO.

# HLD: Discontinued statin since CMO.

# Atrial fibrillation: Adequately rate controlled off beta 
blocker except occasionally in low 100s.  Had held metoprolol 
and apixaban since she was NPO and now stopped because CMO.

# DM type II: Held home Lantus and Sitagliptin while NPO and 
stopped all glucose checks and insulin.

# COPD: No evidence of acute exacerbation. PRN nebs were given 
for comfort.

# Chronic pain: During her hospital course, her home gabapentin 
and oxycodone were held in setting of altered mental status and 
no oral intake.  These were not restarted on discharge.

TRANSITION OF CARE ISSUES:
- She was discharged to ___ facility in ___ 
with ___, where they will provide her medications 
including PRN Dilaudid, Ativan, Haldol.

Ms. ___ is clinically stable for discharge today. The total 
time spent today on discharge planning, counseling and 
coordination of care was greater than 30 minutes.

system.  You had kidney failure that may have been due to 
contrast dye for CT scans, but this was improving.  You had high 
sodium likely due to dehydration.  Your family ultimately 
decided to focus on making you as comfortable as possible and 
you are being discharged to a hospice care facility, where you 
will continue to have medical care to keep you comfortable.

History of Present Illness:
___ F with CAD s/p 3-vessel CABG and stents x2, HLD, DM2, recent 
diagnosis of Afib on coumadin presents with palpitations. Woke 
up from nap today around 3pm with several hours of severe 
palpitations, dizziness and chills. Similar to symptoms of 
previous admission, though this time less severe, but of longer 
duration. Slowly resolved after ___ hours, so that symptoms had 
resolved around 7pm. Yesterday she felt weak all day, but was 
unsure why.  
.  
Of note, the patient was recently admitted ___ with a 
complaint of plapitations and was found to be in decompensated 
CHF. Her atenolol was increased to 75mg daily, she was diuresed 
with IV lasix, and her PO lasix was increased to 60mg daily on 
discharge.  
.  
On review of systems, she denies any prior history of stroke, 
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the 
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black 
stools or red stools. She denies recent fevers, chills per HPI. 
She denies exertional buttock or calf pain. She has had severe 
constipation, most recent BM 2 days ago. Urination normal, no 
symptoms like her prior UTIs. All of the other review of systems 
were negative.  
.  
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain, 
dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, 
ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.  
.  
In the ED, initial vitals were 98.5 86 116/66 20 100% 10L NRB. 
EKG showed afib and subtle worsening of prior ST depressions. 
CXR clear, trop negative, INR 2.3. UA had 7 WBC, Few Bact, 1 
Epi. Vitals prior to transfer were 68 125/74 13 96% RA.  

 
Past Medical History:
Cardiac Risk Factors: DM, Dyslipidemia, Hypertension  
.  
Cardiac History:  
s/p MI ___: 3.0X13mm stent to mLAD, 2.5X13mm stent to pLCX  
CABG, in ___ anatomy as follows: LIMA to LAD, SVG to rPDA, rPL 
(sequential grafting)  
.  
Percutaneous coronary intervention ___ with 2x more recent 
caths): 
1. Coronary arteriography in this right dominant system revealed 
two 
vessel disease. The LMCA was calcified with a 30% ostial 
stenosis. The mid LAD had a 80% stenosis which was also 
calcified. The D1 and D2 arteries were both small. The D2 artery 
had a 60% ostial stenosis. The LCx was subtotally occluded in 
its mid portion. Distal to the occlusion collaterals were seen 
filling the distal LCx and OM1 from the RCA.The RCA was a large 
vessel with some mild luminal irregularities in the mid and 
distal portions. 
2. Resting hemodynamics were performed for the left side and 
revealed LV pressures of 170/14 mmHg. The elevated LVEDP in a 
patient with a normal end diastolic volume index is consistent 
with minimal to mild diastolic dysfunction. There was no 
pressure gradient measured across the aortic valve. 
3. Left ventriculography revealed anterolateral akinesis and 
apical 
hypokinesis. The calculated LVEF was 53%. No mitral 
regurgitation was 
seen. 
4. Successful stenting of the mid LCx with a 2.25x13mm Bx 
Velocity 
stent and stenting of the mid LAD with a 3.0x13mm Bx Velocity 
stent each with 0% residual stenosis. 
  
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:     
1. Two vessel coronary artery disease. 
2. Mild diastolic ventricular dysfunction. 
3. Successful stenting of the mid LCx and mid LAD.

Brief Hospital Course:
___ F with CAD s/p 3-vessel CABG and stents x2, HLD, DM2, recent 
diagnosis of Afib on coumadin presents with palpitations.

 Monitored on telemetry and found to be in atrial fibrillation 
with no episodes of rapid rate.  Symptoms were discussed with 
the patient as commonly occuring with atrial fibrillation and 
worsen with anxiety, so she was encouraged to take lorazepam as 
needed with palpitations.  She will follow up with Dr. ___.

# PUMP: Euvolemic on exam, continued lasix at 60 mg daily and 
atenolol 75 mg daily  
  
# Coronaries: no chest pain with current event, unlikely to be 
ischemic with no concerning changes on EKG and ruled out for MI 
with cardiac enzymes.  Continued simvastatin

# Bacteriuria: No symptoms suggestive of UTI so no antibiotics 
were given
