Brief Hospital Course:
The patient presented to the emergency department and was 
evaluated by the orthopedic surgery team. The patient was found 
to have a left hip hemiarthroplasty anterior dislocation and was 
closed reduced in the ED with sedation. Post-reduction films 
confirmed reduction of the left hip dislocation. He was admitted 
to the orthopedic surgery service. On HD#2 he was taken to the 
radiology suite with Interventional Radiology for a fluorscopic 
guided hip aspiration to ascertain if his recurrent dislocations 
could be caused by occult hip infection. The cell count from the 
spiration was 4000 WBCs and ___ RBCs, negative crystals, 
final culture no growth, confirming that this was not due to a 
prosthetic joint infection. For his right ankle fracture, which 
was treated with ORIF at ___, a cast change and 
wound check was performed on HD#3 showing incisions healing 
well. 

After discussion with the patient it was decided to treat his 
recurrent dislocations with strict left hip anterior hip 
dislocation precautions. He was made WBAT in the LLE with STRICT 
ANTERIOR hip precautions: to keep left leg internally rotated, 
abducted, and flexed at all times. While in bed, the left leg 
was placed in a multipodis boot with lateral kickstand to place 
leg in 15 degrees of internal rotation, with a pillow under knee 
to keep hip in flexion. He was allowed to sit in chair or on 
commode without abduction brace as long as anterior hip 
precautions are followed. While ambulating, he must have a left 
hip abduction brace in place; this was made by Ortho Tech to 
place his left hip in 15 degrees of hip flexion and ___ degrees 
of hip abduction. He was made NWB in the RLE in his cast per the 
instructions of Dr. ___, who performed the surgical 
fixation of his right ankle at ___.

He was placed on a diabetic diet pain was controlled with oral 
medications. The patients home medications were continued 
throughout this hospitalization. The patient worked with ___ who 
determined that discharge to home was appropriate. He will not 
be able to ambulate due to his precautions but was evaluated and 
found to be safe with his precautions for wheelchair transfers. 
The ___ hospital course was otherwise unremarkable.

At the time of discharge the patient was afebrile with stable 
vital signs that were within normal limits, pain was well 
controlled with oral medications, and the patient was 
voiding/moving bowels spontaneously. The patient is NWB in the 
RLE in a cast, WBAT in the LLE with STRICT ANTERIOR hip 
dislocation precautions, and will be discharged on Lovenox for 
DVT prophylaxis.  The patient will follow up in two weeks per 
routine. A thorough discussion was had with the patient 
regarding the diagnosis and expected post-discharge course, and 
all questions were answered prior to discharge.

IMAGING:
========
___ on ___: he left atrium and right atrium are normal in 
cavity size. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color 
Doppler. The estimated cardiac index is normal (>=2.5L/min/m2). 
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular 
filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size 
and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) 
appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no 
aortic stenosis. No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic 
valve. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve 
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve 
prolapse. No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve. 
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is moderate 
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. No vegetation/mass is 
seen on the pulmonic valve. There is a trivial/physiologic 
pericardial effusion. 

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of ___, 
left ventricular hypertrophy with impaired LV relaxation pattern 
is seen, the degrees of mitral and tricuspid are mild, and the 
estimated pulmonary arterial pressure is greater; other findings 
are similar. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ with h/o DM1 complicated by peripheral neuropathy and 
gastroparesis, HTN, BPH, neurogenic bladder transferred from 
___ for ___ in the setting of acute urinary retention.

severe bilateral hydronephrosis noted on renal u/s and drainage 
of 1.5L of urine with foley placement at ___,  most likely 
post renal from obstructive uropathy. There was no indication 
for acute HD. Cr gradually improved to 2.8 at discharge.

# Acute urinary retention: Pt has h/o acute urinary retention 
due to BPH and neurogenic bladder for which he is followed by 
outpatient urologist Dr. ___. Per phone discussion 
with Dr. ___ leaving foley in placed pending 
outpatient urology follow-up to be arranged at discharge. Of

noted on ___ renal/bladder u/s was concerning or required 
f/u with CT as patient has had normal cystoscopy in the past. 
Patient was planned for Interstim placement ___ which will 
be rescheduled. Home finasteride and tamsulosin were continued. 

# Confusion: Likely due to acute urinary retention and uremia. 
CT head at ___ negative for acute process, no fevers or 
leukocytosis to suggest occult infection. Patient was AAOx 3 on 
arrival.

arrival for HGB 6.9 which was decreased from recent baseline in 
___ records of ~8. Patient denied hematochezia, melena, 
hematemesis or other evidence of bleeding. He denied ever having 
had a colonoscopy. Upper endoscopy at ___ ___ showed 
gastritis,treated with PPI which was continued. He remained

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,
You were admitted for a left hip fracture. Your surgery went 
well and our physical therapists recommended rehab for your 
recovery. We gave you a unit of blood and and IV fluids and your 
kidney function improved back to baseline. Because of this, we 
restarted your lisinopril.

Your glargine was increased from 23 units to 26 units to better 
control your blood glucose while in the hospital.

Please follow-up with orthopaedics in two weeks, and also 
continue to take your enoxaparin [Lovenox] for a total of three 
weeks after your surgery until ___.

Please follow-up with your PCP after leaving the rehab facility. 

Because of your constipation, START senna, colace and miralax 
until you are regular again. Your narcotic pain medications 
cause constipation. Also stay hydrated and stay physically 
active to prevent further constipation.

Your sodium level was low throughout your hospitalization which 
is new. You are to have this monitored at rehab.

The patient was admitted to the orthopedic surgery service and 
was taken to the operating room for above described procedure. 
Please see separately dictated operative report for details. The 
surgery was uncomplicated and the patient tolerated the 
procedure well. Patient received perioperative IV antibiotics.

Postoperative course was remarkable for the following:

#Acute, post op blood loss anemia, EBL 1L intraop, Hct 23.1 on 
POD#1-> 2u pRBCs given, appropriate increase in Hct, but down to 
22.9 on POD#3, another 1u pRBCs given with increase in Hct to 
28.2. 

#Tachycardia, HR 110s, but improved with fluid and blood

#Urinary retention, attempted void trial on POD#2, failed x 2, 
patient has h/o urinary retention and followed by Dr. ___. 
Catheter re-inserted. Communication with his urologist made for 
outpatient follow up. 

#Prosthetic joint infection, ID consulted, intraop cultures 
growing Coag neg staph, IV vanco x 6 weeks recommended. OPAT 
follow up. 

Otherwise, pain was controlled with a combination of IV and oral 
pain medications.  The patient received lovenox for DVT 
prophylaxis starting on the morning of POD#1.  The foley was 
removed and the patient was voiding independently thereafter. 
The surgical dressing was changed on POD#2 and the surgical 
incision was found to be clean and intact without erythema or 
abnormal drainage. The patient was seen daily by physical 
therapy. Labs were checked throughout the hospital course and 
repleted accordingly. At the time of discharge the patient was 
tolerating a regular diet and feeling well.  The patient was 
afebrile with stable vital signs.  The patient's hematocrit was 
acceptable and pain was adequately controlled on an oral 
regimen. The operative extremity was neurovascularly intact and 
the wound was benign. 

The patient's weight-bearing status is weight bearing as 
tolerated on the operative extremity with posterior precautions.

COMMENTS:      
1. Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system 
revealed 
no significant obstructive coronary artery disease. The LMCA was 
free of 
angiographically apparent CAD. THe LAD had a 30% proximal and 
instent 
stenosis with stent otherwise widely patent. The LCx had a 50% 
proximal 
stenosis in superior subbranch of the major OM. The RCA had a 
mid 
segment smooth 60% lesion that was interrogated with a pressure 
wire and 
adenosine infusion with no significant decline in FFR (lowest 
FFR with 
adenosine infusion 0.97) 
2. Limited resting hemodynamics revealed a borderline low blood 
pressure of 88/50 mmHg, thought to be vagally mediated. 
3. Successful hemostasis achived with TR Band. 
  
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:     
1. No significant obstructive coronary artery disease. 
2. Medical management and risk factor modifications. 

EKG ___
Sinus rhythm. Compared to the previous tracing of ___ no 
change.  
  Intervals Axes

endocarditis p/w chest pain at rest, initially thought to have 
NSTEMI now s/p cardiac catheterization without any intervention 
or evidence of acute flow limiting blockage, likely consistent 
with microvascular disease progression.

# CORONARIES / CAD / Chest Pain: Patient presented from OSH to 
___ with h/o CAD s/p DES x1. Patient was taken to cath where 
he was found to have several lesions on cath (LMCA without CAD, 
LAD with 30% proximal and ISR with stent  widely patent, LCx 
with 50% proximal stenosis in superior subbranch of the major 
OM, RCA with mid segment smooth 60% lesion with good flow). In 
the setting of having had no EKG chagnes but with elevated trops 
at ___ without any intervenable lesions on cath, the 
picture and HPI are consistent some microvascular ischemia. 
Patient was continued on his home medications which include 
atenolol, lisinopril, aspirin, pravastatin 40, as this event was 
not thought to be from NSTEMI.

# Staph epi UTI: Patient was transferred from OSH on bactrim for 
asymptomatic positive UA with + nitrites, - leuks, ___ wbc, 2+ 
bacteria. Repeat UA at ___ showed + leuks, + nitrites, WBC and 
bacteria is concerning for UTI. Pt was transitioned to 
ciprofloxacin on ___ to improve prostate penetration. Once staph 
epi was ultimately identified patient was switched to vancomycin 
on ___, and sensitivites from OSH showed vanc sensitivity.  ID 
was consulted given recent staph epi bacteremia and 
endocarditis, who recommended TTE. ID was not concerned as the 
patient has no clinical symptoms or signs of endocarditis and 
likely has asymptomatic bacteuria in the context of a 
neuropathic bladder (certainly his recent
history of incontinence seems to point to the possibility that 
patient may now have autonomic neuropathy in addition to 
peripheral neuropathy). Patient was discharged to complete 10d 
course of bactrim.
