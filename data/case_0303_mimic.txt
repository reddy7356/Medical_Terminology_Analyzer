IMAGING
Ultrasound - intraoperative (___): 1.  The uterine fundus 
appears intact. 
2.  There is linear air within the myometrium of the anterior 
lower uterine segment with an echogenic avascular region within 
the lower anterior uterine segment and possibly on the surface 
of the uterus.  Evaluation for uterine wall dehiscence would be 
better evaluated by a contrast-enhanced CT pelvis. 
3.  No complex fluid collection within the pelvis to suggests 
presence of a pelvic hematoma. 

CT Pelvis w Contrast (___): Large amount of heterogeneous 
material in the endometrial cavity, compatible with blood 
products.  Multiple locules of air within the endometrial cavity 
are likely postprocedural in nature.  Flowing contrast within 
the endometrial cavity is concerning for active bleed, with the 
greatest density of contrast adjacent to the anterior wall of 
the lower uterine segment, which may be the source of bleed. 
  
2.  Bulge of the anterior wall of the lower uterine segment 
containing blood products and gas locules, without visualization 
of any overlying myometrium.  The fat plane between the anterior 
wall of the uterus and the bladder is preserved, therefore 
uterine dehiscence is felt less likely at this time.  However, 
close clinical follow-up is recommended. 
  

 
Brief Hospital Course:
On ___, Ms. ___ is a ___ year old G5P2 woman who 
was admitted to the gynecology service after undergoing dilation 
and evacuation at 16 weeks gestational age for known fetal 
anomalies (trisomy ___) complicated by uterine atony not 
adequately responsive to uterotonics (pitocin, methergine, 
misoprostol) requiring a second dilation and curettage procedure 
as well as uterine artery embolization. Please see the operative 
reports for full details. She was admitted for observation, 
monitoring of her bleeding, and pain control.

Total estimated blood loss was approximately 1400 ml. She 
received a total of 3 unites of pure red blood cells for 
symptomatic blood loss anemia and blood pressures in the 
100/50s. Intraoperative ultrasound during the repeat dilation 
and curettage showed a large amount of clot in the endometrium. 
A CT pelvis with contrast was performed to better evaluate for 
the uterine myometrium; uterine dehiscence and free fluid were 
not seen, but contrast extravasation from the left anterior wall 
into the endometrial cavity raised concern for an active bleed. 
The patient was taken to Interventional Radiology for uterine 
artery embolization, which was successful. Afterwards, her vital 
signs normalized and she remained hemodynamically stable. Her 
hematocrit was also stable between 24.2 and 25.4.

Immediately post-op, her pain was controlled with hydromorphone 
PCA and acetaminophen. Her diet was advanced without difficulty 
and she was transitioned to oral hydromorphone, acetaminophen, 
and ibuprofen. A foley had been placed on after her procedure 
out of concern for urinary retention. Preliminary results of a 
urine culture from a catheter specimen is growing ___ CFU 
of E. coli. On post-operative day 2, her urine output was 
adequate so her foley was removed and she voided spontaneously.  
By post-operative day 2, she was tolerating a regular diet, 
voiding spontaneously, ambulating independently, and pain was 
controlled with oral medications. She was then discharged home 
in stable condition with outpatient follow-up scheduled.
