___ male presents with episode of syncope. He hiked a 
few hours with his wife in the morning and subsequently felt 
lightheaded after not drinking watre in the morning. Later in 
the day, after eating lunch, he sat down and syncopized; per 
wife no head strike; per pt no urinary or bowel incontinence. 
Was brought to ED from EMT because B/P was high 90's systolic. 

ACTIVE ISSUES
# Syncope: Upon further history taking, patient notes he run 
110-100' systolic BP routinely, and works out in a gym 2 X a 
week (and reports feeling lightheaded during strenuous activity 
with little water intake). Overnight telemetry on patient showed 
no events. Orthostatic taken overnight were negative. Given lack 
of cardiac disease, history of dehydration and post-prandial 
event, patient likely had a vaso-vagal event precipitated by a 
combination of hypovolemic hypotension and post-prandial 
hypotension.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES
# Syncope: Per pcp, may consider stopping home tamsulosin as may 
cause pt to feel lightheaded or dizzy
