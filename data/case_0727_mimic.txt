History of Present Illness:
Ms. ___ is a ___ female with a history of asthma, 
CAD (s/p inferior NSTEMI with stent placement in L circumflex 
and RCA in ___, HTN, HLD, PVD who presents with acute onset of 
shortness of breath this morning. She awoke at 3:30am with 
wheezing, coughing, and shortness of breath. Her and her 
daughter note that she tried to use her combivent inhaler, but 
the spray went all over and did not reach her mouth/respiratory 
tract. Her wheezing and coughing resolved, but she then awoke 
again at 6:18am with a similar episode of shortnes of breath, 
wheezing, cough productive of white sputum, and diaphoresis. She 
did not have any chest pain. EMS was then called by her 
daughter. When EMS arrived, her BP was 178/80, she appeared 
diaphoretic, and her oxygen saturatuion was in the ___ on 
facemask. She received CPAP, SL nitro, and a nebulzer treatment. 
Her BP then came down to 140/90.  
.  
On arrival to the ED, the patient was described as appearing 
more comfortable. VS were HR 57, BP 122/59, RR 15, SaO2 98% 2L. 
EKG showed sinus bradycardia (HR 55) and only non-specific ST 
changes. Troponin-T was < 0.01. BNP was elevated at ___. Other 
labs were notable for Cr of 1.3 and lactate of 1.0. CXR 
preliminary read is only significant for bibasilar atalectasis. 
UA negative and blood cultures were drawn x2. She recieved 
solumedrol 125mg, ceftriaxone 1g, azithroymcin 500mg, ___ 81mg, 
duonebs, and lasix 20mg IV x1. She received another set of 
duonebs at 11:45am after her breathing was described as "a 
little tight" with good relief. She was admitted to medicine for 
dyspnea and apparent diagnosis of new CHF vs. asthma 
exacerbation. On transfer, her vitals were HR 68 BP 136/67, RR 
17, SaO2 100% 2L.  
.  
On the floor, Ms. ___ reports that she feels much better and 
no longer feels short of breath. She denies any history of 
fevers, chills, nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea. She does not 
endorse pleuritic chest pain. She sleeps with 2 pillows at night 
and this has not changed. Her granddaughter helps her take all 
of her medications and she has been taking all of them, but she 
does not believe she is using her combivent inhaler properly. 
She has had no change in diet and denies any increased salt 
intake. She does not endorse any lower extremity edema.  
.

Brief Hospital Course:
Presentation:
___ female with a history of asthma, CAD (s/p inferior 
NSTEMI with stent placement in L circumflex and RCA in ___, 
HTN, HLD, PVD who presents with acute onset of shortness of 
breath this morning, likely secondary to asthma exacerbation.  
.
Active Issues:
# Shortness of breath - Consistent with Asthma exacerbation; she 
may also have undiagnosed COPD which could contribute.  New 
onset CHF was considered because of pulmonary exam that 
indicates volume overload, and elevated BNP -- however, she does 
not have an elevated JVP or lower extremity edema, has been 
taking all of her cardiac medications, does not report a change 
in diet, and does not report any orthopnea or change in weight.  
CXR only showed cardiomegaly with bilateral atalectasis.  MI was 
considered given her history of CAD, but she did not endorse 
chest pain, EKG showed no changes unremarkable, and Troponin-T 
was negative x3.  
She improved quickly with nebulizers and systemic steroids with 
40mg prednisone daily for a total duration of 5 days.  We did 
not continue the antibiotics that were started in the ED because 
of our low suspician of infection.  We weaned her O2 on ___ and 
obtained ambulatory oxygen saturations. The nursing staff 
educated the patient and her family on proper inhaler use.  Pt 
was then discharged home on home inhalers and to finish course 
of steroids.  She will follow up in Pulmonary clinic for PFT's 
(which have never been done to our knowledge), disease and 
medication teaching and optimization of her home medication 
regimen. 
.  
# Leukocytosis - Ms. ___ white count was normal on 
admission, but up to 14.2 on ___.  We attriubted this to the 
initiation of steroid treatment as she was afebrile and looked 
well clinically.  
.
# CAD - She ruled out with Troponin-T negative x3 and did not 
have any telemtry events overnight on admission.  We contined 
her ___, statin, and imdur.
.
# Eosinophila - On admission, Ms. ___ was found to have a 
differential of 8.1% eosonophils.  This was most likely 
secondary to asthma, but should be rechecked as an outpatient to 
ensure resolution.
.
# History of small amounts of stool - Ms. ___ and ___ family 
endorsed that she was lately having only small amounts of stool. 
 We recommend outpatient evaluation and outpatient colonoscopy.
.
Chronic Issues:
# HTN - We continued home meds
# HLD - We continued home med
# Adjustment with depressed mood - We continued home med
# Right shoulder pain - We continued standing tylenol
.
Transitions of Care:
- Ms. ___ should have outpatient PFTs to characterize her 
obstructive pulmonary disorder.  We have contacted Dr. ___ 
office to see if she can be scheduled for PFTs and a session on 
teaching for inhaler and spacer use as well as peak expiratory 
flow measurements.  She will need an interpreter for this visit.
- The addition of a spacer to her inhaler should be considered.
- We entertained the diagnosis of new onset CHF on admission.  
We were not able to obtain a ___ before discharge, but one 
should be considered as an outpatient to evaluate her current 
ejection fraction, heart function, and valvular disease (mild AR 
and MR seen on previous ___. 
- Ms. ___ should have outpatient lab work follow up for her 
elevated Cr and eosinophilia.
- Ms. ___ should have outpatient follow up with referral for 
colonscopy for her history of small amounts of stool for the 
last few months.

STUDIES/REPORTS:
==============
___ CXR
FINDINGS:  
AP and lateral views of the chest provided. 
There is no focal consolidation, effusion, or pneumothorax.  The 

cardiomediastinal silhouette is moderately enlarged and stable.  
The hila and pleura unremarkable. Old healed right lateral rib 
fractures are noted.  No free air below the diaphragm is seen. 
IMPRESSION:  
No acute intrathoracic process. 

___ PFTS
IMPRESSION
MECHANICS: The FVC is moderately reduced. The reduction in FEV1 
is moderately severe. The FEV1/FVC ratio is normal.
FLOW-VOLUME LOOP: Moderately reduced flows and volume with an 
abrupt and very early termination of exhalation.
Impression:
Although results are consistent with a restrictive ventilatory 
defect the FVC is likely underestimated due to an early 
termination of exhalation and for this reason an obstructive 
component cannot be excluded. Suggest lung volume measurements 
if clinically indicated. Compared to the prior study of ___ 
there has been no
significant change in FVC and FEV1.

___ TTE
The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left 
ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF = 60%). However, 
the posterior wall appears hypokinetic. Right ventricular 
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve 
is not well seen. There is no aortic valve stenosis. Mild (1+) 
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are 
mildly thickened. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. The left 
ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation. There 
is no pericardial effusion. 
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of ___, the 
left ventricular ejection fraction is increased.  
 
___ CORONARY ANGIOGRAM
The ___ had a focal 10% stenosis.  The LAD had mild diffuse 
disease. The left circumflex artery had 50% in-stent restenosis. 
The RCA had a 50-60% in-stent restenosis. 
 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ is an ___ with PMHx HTN, HLD, CAD status post NSTEMI with 
stent placement to LCx and RCA ___ and history of asthma/COPD 
presenting with chest pain and dyspnea thought to be related to 
uncontrolled asthma. 

# Chest Pain
# Dyspnea
# COPD/Asthma
Patient presented with dyspnea and chest pain described as 
pressure with associated wheezing. Her constellation of symptoms 
are identical to her previous asthma exacerbations, including 
her chest pain which occur ___ per month and have not been 
escalating in severity or tempo. Per the patient and her family, 
her current presentation is similar to her last admission in 
___ during which time she was treated for an 
asthma/COPD exacerbation. Her triggers for asthma include the 
cold air. Upon evaluation inpatient, she was not wheezing and 
was HDS satting well on room air. She denied wheezing and 
dyspnea during her hospitalization. She was afebrile, without 
infectious symptoms and without a leukocytosis. CXR was clear. 
BNP 1681 on admission however similar to prior levels and 
history and exam do not suggest volume overload. Do not suspect 
her chest pressure or dyspnea symptoms reflect ACS including 
unstable angina. TNT peaked at 0.05 and EKG without ischemic 
changes. She denied worsening in her dyspnea or chest pain 
symptoms and denies dyspnea with exertion. The most likely 
explanation of her constellation of symptoms include poorly 
controlled reactive airway disease in setting of COPD/asthma. 
Because she had a clear lung exam and lack of increasing cough 
or sputum and was asymptomatic on the floor, her presentation 
was not thought to be a true exacerbation. Per her outpatient 
pulmonologist, her outpatient regimen includes albuterol, 
ipratroium and budesonide nebulizers three times daily given 
patient is unable to take deep breaths, has had difficulty with 
taking inhaled corticosteroids or bronchodilators, and thus a 
nebulizer is the best way to deposit her medications. She wad 
discharged with pulmology follow up and cardiology follow up. 
Given her report of chest pressure, it is reasonable to consider 
an outpatient street test to further evaluate. In an effort to 
reduce future hospitalizations, budesonide was increased to 1.0 
mg nebulizer TID. 

# Type II NSTEMI
Peak TNT 0.05. EKG was without evidence of ischemia. Likely 
demand type II. Possibly due to elevated blood pressures to SBP 
~190/110 on admission in the setting of feeling short of breath.

# Lactic Acidosis, resolved. 
Likely secondary to nebulizer treatments.

# HTN:
Presented with hypertensive urgency SBP 190/110 before receiving 
AM meds and in the setting of patient being dyspneic. Home 
losartan, metoprolol and imdur were continued. 

CHRONIC ISSUES:
# CAD/HFpEF, compensated: History of stent LCx and RCA ___. EF 
preserved. Continued statin and plavix.
# Bilateral Peripheral Neuropathy: Continued gabapentin.
# Insomnia: Continued remeron.
# Constipation: Continued home bowel regimen. 
# OA: Continued home APAP prn. 
# HLD: Continued statin.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
=================
MEDICATION CHANGES

Brief Hospital Course:
SUMMARY
=============
___ woman with CAD s/p PCI x 2 (___) with recent STEMI 
medically managed, PVD, asthma, HTN, presenting with one day of 
n/v/d, improved without intervention. 

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
======================
[] PCP follow up for diarrhea.
[] Na at discharge 130, has remained in this range, urine lytes 
were not able to be obtained on this admission, could consider 
further workup as outpatient if persists
[] Patient with foot burning during this admission. Consider 
uptitration of gabapentin if persists.

Medication Changes
======================
-Started Omeprazole 40 mg PO DAILY 
-Switched from lisinopril to Losartan Potassium 25 mg PO/NG 
DAILY 

ACUTE ISSUES: 
=============== 
#N/V/D: 
This patient's second admission was 2 months with nausea 
vomiting and diarrhea. This could potentially be related to 
gastritis, but the patient has no recent systemic symptoms or 
recent sick contacts. Vomiting was described as dark, but there 
is no evidence of blood per ED notes. The patient's oropharynx 
is clear without evidence of blood and her hemoglobin is stable. 
She notes some straining with defecation which may represent 
constipation and thus this an episode of encopresis, however her 
KUB x-ray did not demonstrate a large stool burden. Given her 
recent hospitalizations without antibiotic use it is reasonable 
that this could represent an episode of C. difficile, however 
the patient's diarrhea resolved without intervention, making C. 
difficile less likely. Patient's vomiting and diarrhea did not 
recur during this admission. She complained of no abdominal pain 
and no nausea and was consuming a diet similar to her home diet 
at the time of discharge from the hospital. Started on 
omeprazole during this admission to alleviate any potential GERD 
contributing to symptoms.

CHRONIC ISSUES: 
=============== 
# Hyponatremia: 
Stable Na at 131 on admission. UOsms last checked ___ and was 
237. Developed hyponatremia during ___ admission for 
STEMI. The day prior, she had been started on lisinopril, which 
has hyponatremia as a rare side effect (<1% per UpToDate). She 
was changed back to losartan on this admission. 

# iCMP (EF 35-40%)
# CAD s/p STEMI
# Apical akinesis: 
STEMI diagnosed ___, medically managed. Initial plan for 3 
months of coumadin/plavix, followed by DAPT. Coumadin recently 
switched to apixaban per outpatient cardiologist (___). EKG 
on admission stable, trop negative. Dry to euvolemic on 
admission.
-continued home apixaban/Plavix
-continued home IMDUR 60
-continued metop at 50mg daily 

# COPD/Asthma - continued duonebs, advair, prn albuterol, and 
home budesonide NF

# HTN - switched lisinopril 5 to losartan 25, continued home 
metoprolol and imdur

# Insomnia - Continued Mirtazapine 15 mg po qhs

# PVD with peripheral neuropathy - Continued Gabapentin 300mg po 
qhs

are patent to
the subsegmental level.  Lung windows demonstrate multiple areas 
atelectasis
within the lower lobes, bilaterally.  More focal consolidation 
at the
posterior dependent right lower lobe (302:167) is new from ___. 
 Biapical
pleural thickening is more prominent on the left.
 
Several calcified granulomas are unchanged (302: 40, 89).  A 2 
mm focus of
nodular atelectasis along the left lower lobe (302:112) appears 
similar to the
prior examination.  Similarly, a 2 mm subpleural left lower lobe 
nodule (302:
122) is essentially stable.  No new or growing pulmonary nodules 
are
identified.
 
No suspicious osseous lesions are identified.
 
This examination is not tailored for the evaluation of 
subdiaphragmatic
contents.  Within this limitation, the included portions of the 
upper abdomen
demonstrates cholelithiasis and a moderate hiatal hernia.
 
IMPRESSION: 
1.  Multiple tiny, bilateral micronodules which appear stable 
from at least
___.  No new or enlarging pulmonary nodule.  No evidence 
for chronic
interstitial lung disease or aspiration changes.
2.  New bibasilar consolidations, right greater than left, 
demonstrating mixed
and predominantly low attenuation.  Findings may represent 
atelectasis, but
pulmonary infarction is not excluded.  If clinically indicated, 
a chest CTA
could be considered for the evaluation of chronic pulmonary 
embolism.
3.  Borderline cardiomegaly and severe coronary artery 
calcifications.
4.  Cholelithiasis and a moderate axial hiatal hernia.

 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ year old ___ speaking woman with h/o HTN, CAD s/p 
stenting in ___, long smoking history and likely associated 
lung disease, presented to the ED with dyspnea. On arrival to 
the ED, O2 sat was in the ___ and BP was 200/100. She was placed 
on BiPAP with improvement in her O2 sat to 100%. In the ED, she 
was given nebulizers, solumedrol, and antibiotics in addition to 
the BiPAP, and by the time of admission, her O2 requirement had 
entirely resolved. She was noted to have elevated JVP and weigh 
127 pounds on admission with BNP 2700, both the highest recorded 
in our system. She was diuresed with 40 IV Lasix, with further 
subjective improvement in dyspnea. Given this improvement, she 
was not treated any further with steroids or antibiotics, and 
the team felt that she most likely had flash pulmonary edema 
I/s/o uncontrolled HTN which was (at least partially) treated 
with the positive pressure of BiPAP. A CT chest was obtained to 
better elucidate her lung parenchymal disease, which revealed 
new bibasilar opacities, which might reflect atelectasis vs 
pulmonary infarction due to chronic thromboembolic disease. For 
this reason, CTA was obtained, and although evaluation of the 
small arteries was limited by motion, there was no central 
pulmonary embolism. She was discharged on Lasix 20mg daily, with 
plan for daily weights with ___, and f/u with her PCP and 
existing cardiologist.

# Dyspnea: Briefly required BiPAP in ED, weaned to NC over the 
span of ~24 hours. Lung disease has been described as both COPD 
and asthma in past notes, although PFTs have been limited by 
pt's ability to follow directions. Reportedly has had symptoms 
since moving to the ___ ___ years ago. Last admission, was not 
treated with antibiotics or prednisone, symptoms improved with 
nebulizers alone. Suspect her dyspnea is multifactorial, related 
to both her underlying obstructive lung disease, as well as 
diastolic CHF (Most recent TTE was ___, showed EF 60%.) 
Admission weight was 127 lbs and BNP was elevated (2700) above 
prior values. Given difficulty obtaining accurate PFTs in the 
past, a CT chest was performed to evaluate her lung parenchyma. 
This revealed relatively unimpressive disease, supporting a 
significant contribution of diastolic CHF and perhaps flash 
pulmonary edema contributing to her sudden dyspnea. CTA was also 
obtained due to concern for possible chronic thromboembolism on 
CT non-con, but this study did not reveal any evidence of 
pulmonary embolism. She was diuresed with IV lasix and 
transitioned to her home 20mg PO lasix on discharge. She was 
also continued on her home nebulizers.

# HTN: Presented with BP 200/100, resolved with home meds and 
improvement in dyspnea. Last presentation with dyspnea also with 
extremely elevated BPs. Possibly reactive I/s/o extreme 
distress, although also possible cause of flash pulmonary edema. 
She was mainly normotensive throughout admission on her home 
regimen, losartan 25, metop 25mg XL, IMDUR 60mg

HIDA ___: Nonvisualization of the gallbladder on 4 hour delayed 
images
compatible with cystic duct obstruction corroborating the CT 
diagnosis of acute
cholecystitis.

CT: 1. Findings highly concerning for acute calculous 
cholecystitis.  If
clinically equivocal, recommend HIDA scan.
2. The common bile duct is borderline to mildly dilated size for 
patient age,
but appears more prominent than one year prior.  No obstructing 
process
identified.  Could consider MRCP to assess for 
choledocholithiasis.
3. Limited assessment bibasilar opacities due to respiratory 
motion artifact,
likely atelectasis.
4. A left adnexal cyst has decreased in size.

CXR ___:
In comparison with the study ___, the cardiomediastinal 
silhouette is stable and there is minimal if any vascular 
congestion. Mild atelectatic changes are seen at the bases, but 
no evidence of acute focal consolidation.  definite focal 
consolidation.

V/Q ___:
Study is limited without a corresponding ventilation study and
pulmonary embolism cannot be ruled out.  However, the decrease 
in the left lower
lobe is typical for cardiomegaly and the decrease on the right 
base is not
particularly suggestive of pulmonary embolism.

CXR ___:
Compared to chest radiographs since ___ most recently 
___ through
___.
 
Moderate to severe cardiomegaly is chronic.  Lungs grossly 
clear.  No
pulmonary edema.  No pleural abnormality.
 
Severe narrowing of the lower trachea varies on multiple 
radiographs, an indication of tracheomalacia.  
RECOMMENDATION(S):  Clinical assessment for tracheomalacia.

# Abd/Pelvic CT (___):  
1. Dilated gallbladder, with minimal adjacent stranding 
appearing improved since the ___ CT.  However, there are 
small gallstones present, and there is a suspected stone within 
the distal CBD (series 2, image 29). 2. New small bilateral 
pleural effusions. 3. Small hiatal hernia.
 
Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ is a ___ ___ speaking female with 
history of asthma/COPD (not on home oxygen), CAD s/p multiple 
STEMI/NSTEMIs on Plavix, CHF (last EF 39%, ___, atrial 
fibrillation (previous on apixaban but discontinued by her 
outpatient cardiologist) and HTN, who presented with acute 
calculus cholecystitis.

# Goals of care:
Ultimately, focus is comfort and quality of life. Held multiple 
family meetings throughout admission in light of frailty and 
significant medical illness with multiple complications during 
her stay. Patient was made DNAR/DNI and discharged home with 
hospice care. All non-essential meds were discontinued. 

#Acute cholecystitis: Presented with pain, leukocytosis. She was 
started on empiric antibiotics with ceftriaxone and 
metronidazole, and finished course (___). She remained 
hemodynamically stable and with signs of improvement on 
antibiotics alone. However, in the latter portion of the 
hospitalization, she noted increased pain.  In setting of 
leukocytosis (and persistently distended GB), decision was to 
give low dose chronic augmentin.  She was considered poor 
surgical risks given frailty, extensive CAD Hx. Percutaneous 
gallbladder drainage considered as an alternative to surgery, 
however decision to do this was deferred in light of clinical 
improvement on medical therapy and overall goals of care. ACS 
signed off, patient can follow up in ___ clinic: ___.  
Repeat CT scan showed no worsening of gall bladder findings.

___: Most likely pre-renal. Initial creatinine up to 2.1 She 
was initially hydrated with IV fluids and home diuretics held. 
Creatinine on day of discharge 1.1 and plan for diuretics is 
furosemide 80 mg PO daily. Her Lasix was resumed as outlined 
below. 

#History of chronic asthma/COPD:
#Acute asthma exacerbation:
Follows with Dr. ___. Note that in review of records, 
Advair was discontinued in ___ due to concerns that 
patient wasn't using device properly/getting adequate benefit 
from this. On ___, chest x-ray showed severe tracheal stenosis, 
consistent with possible diagnosis of tracheomalacia. Discussed 
with family that broncoscopy for official diagnosis is not 
recommended due to likely need for intubation, and extremely 
high risk of not being able to be extubated. Resumed home ICS 
upon discharge given her goals of care are comfort. Rx for 
saline and albuterol nebulizer solutions were provided (meds to 
bed) prior to discharge. 

#Atrial fibrillation (w/ intermittent RVR):
Outpatient cardiologist discontinued apixaban last ___. Rates 
initially going up to the 150s intermittently iso agitation 
and/or dyspnea, however became more stable with uptitration of 
metoprolol to max dose of 200mg daily. Metoprolol discontinued 
upon discharge to minimize non essential meds. If symptomatic, 
can resume. 

#Hypertension:
Metoprolol discontinued above. Held losartan in setting ___ 
and ultimately discontinued as her goals of care will be comfort 
and not titration of BP meds. 

# Acute on chronic HFrEF:  During the course of the hospital, 
she had net I>O of ___ L.  In addition, she had markedly 
elevated BNP to 30,000 and significant wheezing.  She was given 
lasix 40 mg IV with good response. She will be discharged home 
on PO Lasix 80 mg daily, with a goal of Lasix to provide 
comfort.

# Severe hyponatremia; During the hospitalization, her Na 
nadired to 114.  This occurred while being volume overloaded.  
Urine Na <5.  Unusually, developed in setting of Lasix and brisk 
diuresis.  It was believed to be presumably ___ to net body Na 
stores low and solute/solvent imbalances and also losartan (now 
d/c'd).  She was restricted in liquids and placed on NaCl tables 
and lasix PO.  Sodium stabilized at 129 by the time of 
discharge. As above, since goals of care are consistent with 
hospice, this was not pursued. 

#Asymptomatic bacteriuria: no urinary symptoms, antibiotics as 
above

#Type 2 NSTEMI: mild troponin leak in setting of infection. 
Peaked at 0.03
#CAD: Discontinued home Plavix, statin, imdur, metoprolol, given 
goals of care
#Afib: Outpatient cardiologist discontinued apixaban last ___
#HTN: Discontinue home losartan, metoprolol, imdur
#psych: Cont home mirtazapine - can be d/c by hospice if felt 
necessary but would use to stimulate appetite/nutrition 
#GERD: Cont home omeprazole - can be discontinued if felt not 
helping 
#Pain: Rx home with morphine oral concentrate and Ativan 
solution. Unfortunately morphine oral concentrate required a 
prior auth and the patient was ready for discharge. Spoke to 
hospice agency who noted that comfort kit would arrive tomorrow, 
and as a bridge to receiving it, would send home with Rx for 
morphine ___ 15mg - dir take ___ tab q6hrs for pain. Reviewed 
with the family to crush it and put it in some applesauce, and 
start with ___ dose as that would more closely mirror her 
current dose of 2mg. As noted, comfort kit will arrive tomorrow. 

#Code status: DNR, DNI, DNH. MOLST filled with HCP prior to 
discharge ___. 
#Dispo: discharge home with hospice. Shifting focus of care to 
comfort, therefore all nonessential meds were discontinued, and 
to facilitate minimizing her pill burden. She would benefit from 
diuretic and indefinite antibiotics to minimize discomfort. 
Plan of care discussed with the patient's family (multiple 
family members including HCP) present at bedside before 
discharge.

Discharge Instructions:
Ms. ___,

You were admitted to ___ with an infection of your gall 
bladder. We treated you with antibiotics. You and your family 
talked with the surgeons and felt that the risks of surgery to 
remove your gallbladder or placement of a gallbladder drain 
outweighed the benefits. The infection appears to have improved 
with antibiotics alone - which can continued indefinitely or 
until your follow up with your primary care doctor.  

During this hospitalization, you were also noted to be in 
significant heart failure.  For this reason, you were given 
medications to help you urinate the extra fluid.  There were 
periods where the sodium decreased during this time, but your 
sodium has improved.

You will assisted at home with the hospice service. We have 
discontinued all non essential medications for you. We have 
written you a prescription for immediate release morphine 
tablets because our pharmacy could not fill the prescription we 
planned to send you with. Hospice will Fed-ex the proper 
morphine dose to your house tomorrow. In the meantime, if you 
need to treat pain, split the pill into 4ths and give ___ of 
those pieces for pain. 

Again, it was a pleasure looking after you and we wish you well.

Your ___ Team

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ is a ___ year old female with history of CAD s/p PCI x 
___ and STEMI in ___, PVD, COPD, and HTN presenting with 
acute onset chest pain and dyspnea. 

ACUTE/ACTIVE PROBLEMS:
# Hypoxemic hypercarbic respiratory failure, acute
# COPD, acute exacerbation
# Steroid-induced hyperglycemia
Patient presented with one day of shortness of breath with 
associated chest pain similar to prior COPD/asthma 
exacerbations.  She was initially on BiPAP with plans for ICU 
however she improved dramatically with duonebs, azithromycin and 
steroids in
the ED to the point where she is now on room air. She was given 
vancomycin and cefepime in the ED given ? opacity on her CXR 
however since she is afebrile without a leukocytosis, so held 
off on further antibiotics.  She was placed on five days of 
high-dose prednisone and azithromycin.  Patient was less 
hyperglycemic while on the medical floor, requiring minimal 
sliding scale insulin.  Patient should have PFTs as an 
outpatient.  She will not be placed on insulin at home, as she 
only has two further days of steroid treatment planned, and 
blood sugars were in 100s-200s.  She has follow-up scheduled 
with her PCP and pulmonologist.

# Type 2 NSTEMI: troponin elevated on admission and now 
normalized.  Likely in setting of increased demand due to 
respiratory failure. Pt has persistent T wave inversions on EKG. 
 She was continued on metoprolol.  She was also started on 
isosorbide mononitrate, which will be continued as an 
outpatient.
- repeat troponin downtrended

# Acute kidney injury: creatinine elevated on admission, which 
improved with IV fluid to her normal level.

# Hyponatremia: Likely due to hypovolemia, prerenal etiology.  
Fluid intake was encouraged and IV fluids were provided.  Sodium 
normalized by time of discharge.

# Anion gap acidosis: lactate 3.4 on admission suggesting lactic 
acidosis due to poor tissue perfusion in setting of hypoxia.  
This trended to normal with supportive treatment.

CHRONIC/STABLE PROBLEMS:
# Vitamin deficiency: continued Calcium Carbonate 1500 mg PO/NG 
BID and Multivitamins W/minerals 1 TAB PO/NG DAILY

# GERD: continued Omeprazole 40 mg PO DAILY

# Dry eye: continued Artificial Tears GEL 1% ___ DROP BOTH EYES 
Q6H

# Constipation: patient was placed on Senna 8.6 mg PO/NG BID and 
Docusate Sodium 100 mg PO/NG BID

# Peripheral neuropathy: patient continued Gabapentin 300 mg 
PO/NG DAILY.  She may need uptitration as pt still complains of 
symptoms

# Hypertension: patient was continued on Losartan Potassium 25 
mg PO/NG DAILY and was started on Imdur 60 mg PO daily.

# Insomnia: continued Mirtazapine 15 mg PO/NG QHS

# CAD s/p PCI
# Prior STEMI
# History of HFrEF
Had elevated BNP on admission but c/w prior values. Denies 
orthopnea, PND and feels SOB is more c/w asthma exacerbation.  
She was continued on home metoprolol, atorvastatin, losartan, 
clopidogrel and apixaban.  She was started on Imdur.

TRANSITIONS OF CARE
-------------------

ACUTE ISSUES
============

# s/p Acute hypoxic respiratory failure
# s/p ?COPD exacerbation
# sCHF: last EF in ___ is 39%
She presented with acute shortness of breath and hypoxia, and 
there was concern for COPD and CHF, so she was started on IV 
steroids, given IV Lasix in the ED. She was also given broad 
spectrum antibiotics for pneumonia but no clear pneumonia on 
XRay, but eventually this was narrowed to Levaquin for 7 days of 
treatment. ___ she had another episode where she felt very 
short of breath and O2 sats dipped into low 80's on room air. 
She improved quickly with breathing treatment, IV steroids, and 
more Lasix and quickly improved. Since that time, her breathing 
was comfortable and she was quickly weaned to room air. She will 
be continued on levaquin 750 mg q48h for 7 days (Next doses 
___, and ___. She should also continue prednisone for 
through ___ then stop. She should follow up with Dr. ___ 
in pulmonary sooner than previously scheduled.

# ___ on CKD
# Hyponatremia
# Hyperkalemia
Baseline creatinine 0.9-1.1. Admission creatinine 1.3 and rising 
to 1.5. Suspected an element of vascular congestion in the 
setting of CHF but her creatinine remained stable at 1.5 on day 
of discharge.

ACUTE MEDICAL ISSUES
# Nausea/Vomiting
Shortly after prior discharge for STEMI on ___, at which time 
plavix and warfarin were started for medical management, 
patient had one episode of emesis without frank red blood. 
Emesis was "coffee brown" with a thick consistency. She had one 
further episode of emesis while hospitalized described as dark 
by RN but no obvious evidence of blood or coffee grounds and 
occurred after having meatballs with sauce for dinner the night 
before. Hemoglobin remained stable, so low suspicion for 
significant bleeding.  Patient tolerating PO on discharge.

INR was trended. The patient had no more emesis, no bloody 
stools, no black tarry stools. She denied any chest pain or 
shortness of breath. IRN at discharge 1.6. Coumadin dose at 
discharge 0.5mg daily down from 2.5mg before admission.    Will 
need continued close titration.

IMAGING:
=========
CXR ___
Stable cardiomegaly with pulmonary vascular congestion.  
Possible small left pleural effusion.  No frank pulmonary edema. 


TTE ___
The left atrial volume index is moderately increased. The right 
atrium is mildly enlarged. There is normal left
ventricular wall thickness with a borderline increased/dilated 
cavity. There is moderate to severe regional left
ventricular systolic dysfunction with near akinesis of the basal 
___ of the inferior and infero-lateral walls,
hypokinesis of the more distal segments and mild apical dykineis 
(see schematic) and normal function of the
remaining segments. No thrombus or mass is seen in the left 
ventricle. Quantitative 3D volumetric left
ventricular ejection fraction is 35 %. Left ventricular cardiac 
index is normal (>2.5 L/min/m2). There is
no resting left ventricular outflow tract gradient. No 
ventricular septal defect is seen. Tissue Doppler suggests
an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP greater 
than 18 mmHg). Normal right ventricular cavity
size with mild global free wall hypokinesis. The aortic sinus 
diameter is normal for gender with normal
ascending aorta diameter for gender. The aortic arch diameter is 
normal with a normal descending aorta
diameter. The aortic valve leaflets (?#) are mildly thickened. 
There is no aortic valve stenosis. There is mild to
moderate [___] aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets 
appear structurally normal with no mitral valve
prolapse. There is mild [1+] mitral regurgitation.The pulmonic 
valve leaflets are not well seen. The tricuspid
valve leaflets appear structurally normal. There is mild [1+] 
tricuspid regurgitation. There is mild pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion. 
There is a prominent anterior fat pad.
IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Borderline dilated left 
ventricular cavity size with regional
systolic dysfunction most consistent with multivessel coronary 
artery disease. Mild-moderate
aortic regurgitation. Mild mitral regurgitation with normal 
valve morphology. Mild pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension.

with acute onset dyspnea likely secondary to COPD exacerbation 
with
possible HFpEF exacerbation, as well. 

ACUTE ISSUES 
=============== 
# Acute COPD/asthma exacerbation 
In ED, initially requiring BiPAP and admission to ICU but 
recovered quickly, was weaned to room air, and transferred to 
medicine service. On the floor, continued on prednisone 40mg 
daily and azithromycin for planned 5d course with stable 
clinical status. Triggered morning of ___ for increasing 
tachypnea and poor air movement on exam; was treated with 
albuterol nebs x3 and IV methylpred 60mg with improvement. 
Repeat CXR stable and repeat VBG with increased hypercarbia to 
high 50's. Ultimately improved and was continued on 
azithromycin, prednisone, and duonebs. 

# Acute on chronic systolic heart failure exacerbation
Mildly hypervolemic on admission with reported weight gain in 
the week prior to presentation. Initially treated with IV Lasix

Baseline Cr 1.2-1.5. Cr increased to 1.6 after re-initiation of 
home furosemide 80mg, but ultimately improved to 1.3 on day of 
discharge. 

CHRONIC ISSUES:
===============
# CAD s/p PCI
On admission, was taking apixiban only. Clarified home 
anticoagulation/antiplatelet agents with Dr. ___ 
outpatient cardiologist), who recommended discharge on 
clopidogrel alone for management of MI, so apixiban ultimately 
discontinued. 

# HLD: Continued home atorvastatin

IMAGING / STUDIES
==============
CHEST X-RAY ___
Mild bibasilar patchy opacities, likely atelectasis, but 
infection is not 
completely excluded in the correct clinical setting. 

TTE ___
The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left 
ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF = 60%). However, 
the posterior wall appears hypokinetic. Right ventricular 
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve 
is not well seen. There is no aortic valve stenosis. Mild (1+) 
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are 
mildly thickened. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. The left 
ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation. There 
is no pericardial effusion. 

 Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of ___, 
the left ventricular ejection fraction is increased.  

 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ with h/o asthma/COPD who presents chest pain and dyspnea, 
with negative troponins and elevated BNP c/f acute reactive 
airway disease exacerbation and/or acute exacerbation of 
systolic congestive heart failure. Patient's symptoms improved 
with prednisone, ceftriaxone, azithromycin, and 
albuterol/ipratropium nebs. She had an episode of chest pain, 
associated with lateral ST depressions, which resolved with 
nitroglycerin.  Troponins were negative, and she was seen by 
cardiology, who did not recommend any further workup as the 
presentation was thought to be associated to her reactive 
airways disease rather than ACS. She had an EKG with lateral ST 
depression which improved nitro. An ECHO was unrevealing. She 
will be ___ with Dr. ___ outpatient in 2 weeks. 

#COPD/asthma exacerbation: No clear consolidation on CXR, but 
unable to rule out infection. Afebrile, no leukocytosis, flu 
negative. Improved significantly with standing nebs, and 5 day 
course of prednisone. Likely due to reactive airway disease
exacerbation in the setting of PMH of COPD/asthma. Also treated 
with 5 day course of IV ceftriaxone and azithromycin x 5 days.  

#Mixed systolic/diastolic heart failure exacerbation:  Patient 
was clinically volume overloaded on admission with wet rales, 
elevated BNP, orthopnea.  This improved rapidly with a one time 
dose of IV Lasix 20mg on admission.  

#Chest Pain: EKG wnl, troponins x 1 negative in ED. Persumed
volume overload with elevated BNP consistent with acute on
chronic systolic heart failure. Exam with slight pitting edema
and bibasilar crackles. One episode of CP on ___ with EKG
concerning for NSTEMI w/ lateral ST depressions. Given nitro,
morphine, and started on heparin gtt with improvement in 
symptoms
and EKG findings. Repeat trops negative. MB stable at 4. 
Cardiology consulted. Less likely cardiac in nature, stopped 
heparin gtt. Recommend o/p ___. ECHO w/ improved EF (EF 
60%) from prior study in ___. Increased imdur to 60 mg PO daily 
on discharge. 

#Toxic/metabolic encephalopathy: Acute change in mental status x 
1. Patient more
agitated and confused compared to her baseline. Likely from
prednisone pulse and hospital related delirium. UA negative. 
Improved without intervention. 

CHRONIC ISSUES
---------------
#HTN: Continued losartan, metoprolol XL and Imdur.

#PAD/CAD/HLD: Continued statin and clopidogrel.

#INSOMNIA: Continued remeron.

#CONSTIPATION: Continued senna and miralax.

#OA pain: Continued Tylenol.

Brief Hospital Course:
___ female with a history of asthma, CAD (s/p inferior 
NSTEMI with stent placement in L circumflex and RCA in ___, 
HTN, HLD, PVD who presents with acute onset of shortness of 
breath and chest pain; found to have NSTEMI.  
.  
#NSTEMI -  The patient was admitted with substernal chest pain 
and shortness of breath in the absence of EKG changes.  Troponin 
rose from 0.01, peaked at 0.19, and normalized.  Chest pain 
resolved on a heparin drip.  The patient underwent ECHO that 
showed mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with 
focal basal infero-lateral akinesis to dyskinesis (EF 50%).  She 
underwent cardiac catheterization that showed 2 vessel disease 
and in-stent restenosis of left circumflex artery with good FFR 
(0.96).  No intervention was performed.  The patient was 
discharged to home on Aspirin 325 mg daily, Plavix 75 mg daily, 
atorvastatin 80 mg qHS, metoprolol, and imdur.  Given acute 
kidney injury, her home ___ was held throughout admission.  It 
was resumed at discharge with improvement in her renal function. 
 The patient will follow up with her cardiologist upon 
discharge.        
.
#Shortness of breath - The patient was admitted with shortness 
of breath/hypoxia associated with orthopnea and PND in setting 
of NSTEMI, concerning for systolic CHF exacerbation from 
ischemic event.  BNP 2300.  She also has a history of severe 
asthma likely contributing to symptoms.  The patient underwent 
an ECHO that showed mild LV systolic dysfunction (EF 50%).  She 
was diuresed with IV lasix and was maintained on scheduled 
nebulizers.  She was weaned off of oxygen.  Given euvolemia and 
insignificant dysfunction on ECHO, the patient was discharged to 
home without initiation of an outpatient diuretic regimen.  Her 
inhaler prescriptions were renewed.  The patient will follow up 
with her cardiologist upon discharge.         
.  
#Acute Kidney Injury: The patient was admitted with a creatinine 
of 1.5 from baseline of 1.2.  Urine culture was negative.  
Creatinine returned to baseline with diuresis, making the 
etiology likely prerenal azotemia from poor forward flow.  
Losartan was held during admission due to acute kidney injury.  
It was resumed at discharge.  
.  
#Hypertension - The patient remained normotensive throughout 
admission.  On admission, home atenolol was discontinued 
secondary to acute kidney injury.  She was started on metoprolol 
succinate.  Losartan was held during admission for ___.  It was 
resumed at discharge.

Cardiac cath ___:
COMMENTS:     
1. Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system 
revealed
two vessel coronary artery disease. The LMCA had a focal 10% 
stenosis.
The LAD had mild diffuse disease. The left circumflex artery had 
50%
in-stent restenosis. The RCA had a 50-60% in-stent restenosis.
2. Limited resting hemodynamics showed mildly elevated central 
aortic
blood pressure of ___ mmHg.
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:    
1. Two vessel coronary artery disease.

EKG ___:
Sinus rhythm. Early R wave progression. Consider right 
ventricular
hypertrophy. Anterolateral T wave inversions are non-specific. 
Cannot rule
out myocardial ischemia. Clinical correlation is suggested. 
Compared to the
previous tracing the rate is slower. Anterolateral ST-T wave 
changes are more
prominent.

Echocardiogram ___:
The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. No 
atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left 
ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There 
is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with 
hypokinesis to akinesis of the basal inferolateral, basal 
inferior and mid inferior walls. The remaining segments contract 
normally (LVEF = 45-50%). Right ventricular chamber size and 
free wall motion are normal. The diameters of aorta at the 
sinus, ascending and arch levels are normal. The aortic valve 
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. There is no aortic valve 
stenosis. Mild to moderate (___) aortic regurgitation is seen. 
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial mitral 
regurgitation is seen. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic 
pressure is normal. There is an anterior space which most likely 
represents a prominent fat pad. 
IMPRESSION: Normal biventricular cavity size with mild regional 
LV systolic dysfunction as above. Mild-moderate aortic 
regurgitation, trivial mitral and tricuspid regurgitation. 
Normal estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure.
Compared with the findings of the prior study of ___ 
(images reviewed), the degree of aortic insufficiency may be 
slightly increased; otherwise, the findings are similar.

WITH SKIN
      AND/OR GENITAL CONTAMINATION.
 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ with history of asthma (diagnosed at age ___, PFTs 
nondiagnostic), CAD s/p MI ___ with PCI to LCx and RCA and 
NSTEMI ___, HTN, presenting with several days of cough and one 
day acute dyspnea. 

# DYSPNEA. The patient presented with shortness of breath, most 
likely due to an asthma exacerbation given preceding cough, 
wheezing, dyspnea, and history of reactive airway disease.  No 
evidence of volume overload on exam. She was treated with a 
prednisone, nebulizers, and her home asthma therapy. She was 
discharged with a prednisone taper and should follow up with 
pulmonary as an outpatient.

# CAD: Patient with significant history of CAD, s/p multivessel 
PCI to LCx and RCA in ___ and NSTEMI ___ with no intervention 
on cardiac cath. The patient denied chest pain during admission, 
but due to her shortness of breath her cardiac enzymes were 
checked.  They were found to be elevated (troponin peaked at 
0.37), and she also had EKG changes with ST depressions and T 
wave inversions. She was put on a heparin gtt and was  taken for 
cardiac cath. The catheterization did not show new coronary 
artery blockages and no arteries were stented. Echo was mostly 
unchanged from previous. She was discharged on her home cardiac 
medications with cardiology follow up. 

CHRONIC ISSUES:

# Hypertension. Continued Imdur, metoprolol. Decreased losartan 
for low pressures. 

# Constipation. Chronic issue. Continued docusate, senna, 
Miralax PRN

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
- The patient was discharged with a decreased dose of losartan 
for low blood pressures
- Will continue prednisone taper at home: 20mg x3 days, then 
10mg x3 days
- Increased advair dose for better asthma control

Brief Hospital Course:
___ ___ speaking female with a history of CAD 
s/p PCI x ___ with recent STEMI medically managed, PVD,
asthma, COPD presenting with acute onset severe chest pain and 
hypercarbic respiratory failure that resolved after MICU stay 
with BiPAP treatment, treated for COPD exacerbation. 

ACUTE ISSUES: 
=============
#Hypercarbic respiratory acidosis - resolved
#COPD exacerbation - resolving 
#aspiration risk 
Patient with a history of COPD but does not appear to be a known 
CO2 retainer in setting of COPD, presenting with acute onset 
severe chest pain with hypoxia to ___ in the field, found to be 
in hypercarbic respiratory failure on admission to the MICU 
which resolved after receiving BiPAP. Found on exam to have 
wheezing representing a likely COPD/asthma exacerbation, likely 
in the setting of an aspiration event at home. She was treated 
with a 5 day course of a steroid (methylprednisone + prednisone) 
burst as well as 5 days of azithromycin. CT chest on admission 
did show bilateral basilar opacities c/f inflammation vs 
aspiration suggestive of a possible aspiration event. Speech and 
swallow evaluated the patient and found that she was aspirating 
with thin liquids and advised changing her diet to pureed solids 
as well as nectar thick liquids. She did have intermittent 
leukocytosis in the setting of possible aspiration event at home 
as well as her steroid burst, but that was not concerning for 
pneumonia given quick resolution of her leukocytosis and no 
fevers or coughs. She was treated with duonebs, advair, PRN 
albuterol and her home budesonide and was resumed on her home 
COPD medications on discharge. She will have a ___ to help 
ensure that patient is continuing to follow a dysphagia diet at 
home. 

#Chest Pain - resolved
#T wave inversions
#CAD s/p PCI and STEMI
Patient with a significant cardiac hx including 2 prior PCI as 
well as STEMI 5 months prior managed medically. Initial 
EKG/trops were re-assuring, however, repeat studies showed 
uptrending troponin as well as T wave inversions c/f ischemia. 
Likely demand ischemia i/s/o respiratory event. Patient is 
already anticoagulated on apixaban and was previously deemed not 
a candidate for cath in ___. Cardiology was consulted and felt 
that her picture was inconsistent with ACS and that her EKG was 
more suggestive of
stress cardiomyopathy. A TTE showing continued apical akinesis 
and global wall motion abnormality consistent with Takutsubo vs 
multivessel ischemic cardiomyopathy. Her troponins downtrended 
and her EKGs remained stable. She was treated with morphine 2mg 
q6h as needed for angina pain as well as for her feelings of 
respiratory distress for her episodes of chest pain/tightness. 
She was continued to her home apixaban, aspirin, Plavix, and 
atorvastatin. 

# Hyponatremia - resolved
# Hyperkalemia
# adrenal insufficiency
Patient with baseline Na between 130-135. She was admitted with 
Na 121 on arrival which initially was felt to be due to SIADH 
given a downtrend to 119 with 250cc NS bolus, but then on 
additional fluid resuscitation improved to 130s prior to 
discharge. Likely that a component of hypovolemia was 
contributing to her hyponatremia with urine lytes showing low 
FeNa. She was also noted to have hyperkalemia which in addition 
to hyponatremia and low bicarb raised suspicion for adrenal 
insufficiency. She was noted to have a low AM cortisol level and 
on cosyntropin stimulation test did not show an appropriate 
response (1.3 -> 9.2 at 30 minutes -> 11.4 at 60 minutes). 
Endocrinology was consulted for question of adrenal 
insufficiency and they felt that although she did not have 
cortisol stimulation to 18 at an hour, she demonstrated an 
ability to mount an adrenal response to stress given a >9 point 
rise in her cortisol level. They recommended obtaining an ACTH 
value to help differentiate between primary and secondary 
adrenal insufficiency. They did not advise starting steroids 
given the stabilization of her Na prior to discharge and the 
increased risks of steroid treatment with her age, decreased 
bone density and increased risk for bone fractures. She should 
have a repeat BMP a week post discharge and be referred to 
endocrinology for continued workup and management if she is 
found again to be hyponatremia/hyperkalemic. On discharge her Na 
was 138 and potassium was 4.8. 

#Transaminitis 
#hx of Hepatitis B infection
O admission pt was noted to have elevated LFTs in mixed 
hepatocellular/cholestatic pattern that downtrended prior to 
discharge. Hepatitis serologies was significant for a positive 
hepatitis B viral load but negative viral load indicating a 
history of Hep B
infection with no signs of current active infection. Her LFT 
elevations may have potentially been in setting of acute liver 
injury from hypoperfusion vs drug effect that is now resolving. 

#GOC 
Full code confirmed per MICU discussion with patient's two 
daughters and ___. 

CHRONIC ISSUES:
==============
#HFrEF
#HTN
TTE s/p STEMI w/ apical dyskinesis, anteroapical akinesis, and 
inferolateral akinesis. LVEF 35-40% (___). She was continued 
on her home isodil and metoprolol. We held her losartan 
throughout admission but restarted it on discharge. 

# Insomnia - Continued on home Mirtazapine 15 mg po qhs and 
started on ramelteon 8mg qHS for insomnia. 

# PVD with peripheral neuropathy - Continued home Gabapentin 
300mg po qhs

# Dry eyes - continued home QID artificial tears

#GERD: continued home omeprazole 

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: 
====================
[] Speech and swallow evaluation showed signs of aspiration with 
thin liquids and recommended a pureed dysphagia diet with nectar 
thickened liquids. Please ensure patient and family are 
following these recommendations to prevent risk of aspiration. 
[] Please repeat BMP in ___ weeks to evaluate for any continuing 
hyponatremia or hyperkalemia. Na on discharge 140. 
[] Recommend referral to endocrinology for further work-up and 
management of adrenal insufficiency. Would recommend sending an 
ACTH for further workup of primary vs secondary adrenal 
insufficiency and refer to endocrinology for possible initiation 
of steroids for treatment of adrenal insufficiency. 
[] Patient started on ramelteon 8mg qHS for insomnia on 
discharge - please give additional refills as patient and family 
finds helpful or recommend purchasing melatonin over the counter 
if ramelteon is cost-prohibitive. 
[] Continue goals of care discussion with patient and her 
daughters/health care proxies. At this time they would like to 
keep her full code.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,  

It was a pleasure to care for you at the ___ 
___.  

Why did you come to the hospital?  
- You were having sudden chest discomfort with trouble breathing

What did you receive in the hospital?  
- You received additional help with breathing while in the ICU 
and your oxygen levels improved and eventually felt comfortable 
breathing on room air. 
- You were treated for a worsening of your chronic obstructive 
lung disease (COPD) with steroids and antibiotics which made you 
feel better. 
- The swallow specialists assessed your swallowing and felt that 
you were having aspiration (when food and liquid go down into 
your lungs) with normal foods and liquids. They felt that in 
order to keep you from aspirating, you should have soft pureed 
foods as well as nectar thickened liquids. 
- We got EKGs and blood tests which showed that you were not 
having a large heart attack. 
- We did an ultrasound of your heart which continued to show 
that your heart is squeezing abnormally because of the heart 
attack you had in the past as well as your known coronary artery 
disease. 
- You were found to have low cortisol levels and should have 
follow up with an endocrinologist for this. 
- You improved and were ready to go home. We set you up with 
visiting nursing services to help care for you. 

What should you do once you leave the hospital?  
- Please take your medications as prescribed and go to your 
scheduled doctor's appointments. 
- Please ensure to eat only soft pureed foods and drink 
thickened liquids to prevent choking and possible aspiration. 
Make sure to eat only when you are awake, alert and sitting 
upright in a chair, and to remain sitting upright for at least 
30 minutes after you eat. Take frequent breaks between bites and 
alternate between solid food and liquids. Clear the food already 
in your mouth before taking another bite to eat. 
- Please make sure to eat soft pureed foods as well as nectar 
thickened liquids to prevent your risk for choking on your 
foods. 
- You can buy food thickeners at a pharmacy such as ___ or 
___  to add to liquids to help thicken them. A few brand names 
of these include ___ It, 
- Weigh yourself every morning, call your doctor if your weight 
goes up more than 3 lbs.

We wish you the best!

Allergies: 
No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions
 
Attending: ___.
 
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath.
 
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None.
 
History of Present Illness:
Ms. ___ is an ___ ___ woman with a remote 
history of smoking, as well as hypertension, hyperlipidemia, CAD 
s/p PCI and two subsequent NSTEMIs, and asthma who is presenting 
from home with an acute episode of worsening dyspnea, chest 
pain, and sweating that did not relent with a nebulizer 
treatment. 

Ms. ___ was previously diagnosed with asthma at the age of 
___, without PFTs as she was unable to particpate adequately in 
the study. She has since had an estimated 4 hospitalization and 
numerous visits to the ED for exacerbations, but has never been 
intubated or required admission to the MICU. Ms. ___ was 
most recently hospitalized with dyspnea in ___ of this year and 
treated for an asthma exacerbation with bronchodilators and a 
course of steroids. Since that hospitalization, she has had 
worsening of her symptoms. She has had daily awakenings around 4 
am screaming out that she cannot breathe. Her daughter, who 
lives upstairs from her, runs down every morning to administer a 
nebulizer, which typically alleviates her symptoms. She is using 
her nebulizers ___ times daily since her prior hospitalization.

She notes that she was at her adult daycare this morning when 
she had an acute episode of worsening shortness of breath and 
chest tightness, accompanied by chest pain and diaphoresis. The 
___ center called her grand-daughter who came immediately. She 
was administered a nebulizer treatment, but her breathing did 
not improve so she was brought to the ED by ambulance. She does 
report a non-productive dry cough for the past few weeks. She 
denies any recent illness, sick contacts, fevers, chills, or 
exposure to environmental allergens. She reports that she has 
been taking her medications as prescribed, although her 
granddaughter is the only one who knows the details of what she 
is currently taking. In discussion with her reported pharmacist, 
it does appear she may not have refilled many of her asthma 
medications as scheduled (details below).

Of note, during her recent hospitalization, she had an episode 
of chest pain and was found to have an NSTEMI with a TnT peak of 
0.37. She was started on a heparin drip and catheterized, but 
found to have no new thrombis and no intervention was performed. 
Since her discharge, she denies any episodes of chest pain at 
home. Today, she reports onset of substernal chest pain that 
felt more like a squeezing tightness and was distinct from the 
pain she had with her previous MIs.  

In the ED, she was initially found to be in moderate distress,

FINDINGS:  
Cardiac silhouette size remains moderately enlarged. The aorta 
is tortuous. Mediastinal and hilar contours are otherwise 
unchanged. There is no pulmonary vascular congestion. Streaky

effusion or pneumothorax is identified.  No acute osseous 
abnormalities seen. 
IMPRESSION:  
Mild bibasilar atelectasis 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
PRIMRARY REASON FOR ADMISSION:
This is an ___ ___ woman with a remote history 
of smoking, as well as hypertension, hyperlipidemia, CAD s/p PCI 
and two subsequent NSTEMIs, and a pre-existing diagnosis of 
asthma who is presenting from home with an acute on chronic 
episode of worsening dyspnea and chest tightness.

ACTIVE ISSUES:
# Acute on chronic dyspnea: On presentation to the ED, she was 
tachypneic and wheezing persistently, and required a NRB. After 
albuterol and methylpred in the ED, however, by arrival to the 
floor she had no oxygen requirement. Her chest xray showed no 
pneumonia or pleural effusions. Although her asthma diagnosis is 
unusual (diagnosed at age ___ without PFTs), per the patient and 
her family this presentation is similar to prior episodes that 
improved with nebulizers and oral steroids. In discussion with 
her pharmacy, it appears she has not refilled many of her asthma 
medications as scheduled. She was thus started on standing 
albuterol nebs q6h with q2hr prn and a 5-day course of oral 
prednisone 40 mg, She was restarted on her home Advair and 
Spiriva with directions given to her family about how these 
should be taken. She was also given new prescriptions for these 
medications and encouraged to schedule a follow up Pulmonary 
appointment for next week.

# Chest pain: Patient has a significant cardiac history and a 
recent NSTEMI only two months ago. She initially reported chest 
pain but felt that it was different from her heart attack. 
Troponins were negative x2 and EKG remained unchanged. She had 
no recurrent episodes of chest discomfort. She was continued on 
asa, Plavix, metoprolol, atorvastatin.

CHRONIC ISSUES:
# Coronary artery disease: See above. She was continued on her 
home asa, Plavix, metoprolol and atorvastatin.

# Hypertension: Stable. Continued home metoprolol, losartan and 
isosorbide mononitrate.

# Hyperlipidemia. Restarted home atorvastatin.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
====================
- She may benefit from close follow with pulmonology.
- Given her recent NSTEMI, she would also benefit from 
___ rehab
- She will be discharged on prednisone 40mg for a 5 day course 
(last day ___.
- She would benefit from continued teaching about how to take 
her medications.
- Patient complains of ongoing urinary stress incontinence

Discharge Instructions:
Ms. ___,

It was a pleasure taking part in your care at ___! You were 
admitted on ___ with worsening shortness of breath and 
wheezing thought to be from an asthma exacerbation. It sounded 
like your asthma has not been very well-controlled at home since 
you are waking up every morning short of breath and needing to 
use the nebulizer often. We treated you with frequent albuterol 
nebulizers to help you breathe more easily. We also started you 
on a short course of steroid medications to help decrease the 
inflammation in your lungs. You will continue to take the 
steroid medication when at home.

While you were here, we restarted your asthma medications, 
including Advair and Spiriva. These medications are especially 
important to help prevent future asthma attacks. It is very 
important to take all of your asthma medications as prescribed 
to avoid more of these exacerbations. It is also important to 
speak to your pulmonologist about your asthma to see if there 
might be something that would work better for you.

Thank you for allowing us to take part in your care at ___!

Best,

Your ___ medical team

Brief Hospital Course:
PRIMARY REASON FOR ADMISSION
___ year old ___ woman with history of asthma, CAD (s/p 
inferior NSTEMI with stent placement in L circumflex and RCA in 
___, recent NSTEMI), HTN, HLD, and PVD presents with RUQ 
abdominal pain concerning for early acute cholecystitis 
.
# Abdominal/Chest Pain- As above the ___ present from her 
doctors office with ___ right upper quadrant abdominal pain 
concerning for acute cholecystitis. ___ was seen by surgery 
in the ED who felt presentation was consistent with 
cholecystitis however felt she was not a candidate for surgery 
given her recent MI.  They recommended and percutaneous 
cholecystostomy. In the ED she was given morphine for pain 
control and Zosyn. Right upper quadrant ultrasound was initially 
read as concerning for early cholecystitis especially given a 
positive ___ sign.  However in discussion with the 
Radiology attending the imaging was determined to be less 
convincing. There it was recommended that she have a HIDA scan 
prior to percutaneous  cholecystostomy.  She was admitted to 
medicine where she was kept NPO and antibiotics were switched to 
ceftriaxone and Flagyl.  Initial exam was notable for mild RUQ 
tenderness as well as right chest wall tenderness concerning for 
musculoskeletal pain versus fracture.  Rib films were however 
negative for fracture. Give recent history of MI presentation 
was concerning for ACS (EKG also showed increased depressions in 
___ however troponins were negative x 2. HIDA scan was 
negative ruling out acute cholecystitis.  Antibiotics were 
discontinued and the ___ diet was advanced. Ultimately pain 
was felt to be multifactorial in nature with a component of MSK 
pain in addition to constipation (see below). The ___ pain 
was controlled with scheduled Tylenol and prn tramadol. Tylenol 
was continued at the time of discharge. She was discharged with 
instructions to ___ with her PCP.
.
# Constipation- ___ seen in the ED on ___ with severe 
constipation. CT scan at that time was negative for obstruction.

of NSTEMI 2 weeks prior to admission. Cardiac catheterization at 
that time demonstrated cardiac catheterization that showed 2 
vessel disease  and ___ restenosis of left circumflex 
artery with good FFR (0.96).  No intervention was performed. As 
above there was concern for ACS given ___ stated pain was 
somewhat consistent with previous presentation. Additionally EKG 
showed increased ST segment depression in leads V5, V6. However 
reassuringly the ___ troponins were negative x 2 and EKG 
remained stable. The ___ was continued on her home aspirin, 
plavix, atorvastatin, losartan and beta blocker.
.
# Hypertension- ___ was continued on her home beta blocker, 
losartan, and isosorbide mononitrate.

Brief Hospital Course:
SUMMARY: 
==================== 
Ms. ___ is a ___ with CAD c/b STEMI and NSTEMIs, COPD, 
dementia, and recent prolonged admission for cholecystitis and 
hyponatremia ultimately discharged home on hospice who now
presents with cough and shortness of breath, found to be in the 
setting of asthma exacerbation and atelectasis. Her respiratory 
status improved to baseline with 1 dose of IV diuresis and 
nebulizers. She was discharged back home to hospice. 

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
====================
[ ] Please continue to evaluate whether patient and family are 
getting enough support at home. During this admission, patient 
was evaluated by CM and found to have no further needs (has home 
hospice, ___ 2x per week, and niece as official caretaker 
receiving financial compensation) but would continue to discuss. 
Please also evaluate whether hospice is the right choice for 
family, given family's wishes for patient to be hospitalized if 
needed. 
[ ] Patient provided with script for tiotropium at discharge 
given history of COPD, not on LAMA at home. 

# CODE: DNR/DNI confirmed
# CONTACT: Daughters ___ ___

ACUTE/ACTIVE ISSUES: 
==================== 
# Cough # Dyspnea # Hypoxia
# Acute HFrEF Exacerbation
# Asthma exacerbation 
Low suspicion for pneumonia given no fever, no leukocytosis, no
productive cough. There is also likely an asthma exacerbation
component given wheezing, with all of this worsened by
atelectasis. CXR not consistent with significant volume. She 
received 1 dose of IV diuretics and was subsequently resumed on 
her home diuretic. She received nebulizers and pulmonary toilet 
(chest ___, incentive spirometry) and her respiratory status 
improved to baseline. She was prescribed Spiriva at discharge 
given history of COPD and not on long-acting LAMA at home. 

# Goals of Care
Per discussion with daughter ___, their goal of
comfort-focused care has not changed despite hospital transfer.
They were unable to get her comfortable at home, which is why
they brought her in. They confirmed OK with antibiotics, blood
draws, NOT OK with ICU, and still DNR/DNI. 

# ___ (baseline Cr 1.1)
Cr 1.4 on arrival, considering prerenal (daughter reports she 
has
not eaten much in 2 days) vs cardiorenal. Received 500cc NS in
ED. Cr was 1.3 at baseline. 

# Troponemia 
Likely demand ischemia iso HFrEF exacerbation. No changes on EKG
and no chest pain. 

CHRONIC/STABLE ISSUES: 
====================== 
# h/o cholecystitis
Last admission presented with pain, leukocytosis, treated with
ceftriaxone and metronidazole but after finishing course, she 
had
increased pain again. Given poor surgical candidate (frailty and
CAD history) she was started on low dose chronic augmentin. Perc
drainage was considered as alternative to surgery but this
decision was deferred due to clinical improvement and overall
goals of care. Continued home amoxicillin-clavulanic acid ___ 
PO Q12H.

# COPD # Asthma
Advair previously discontinued ___ due to concerns patient 
was
not using device properly and not getting adequate benefit. Of
note CXR ___ showed severe tracheal stenosis concerning for
tracheomalacia. There was discussion to consider bronchoscopy 
for
official diagnosis, but no recommended due to likely need for
intubation and low likelihood of successful extubation. She was
therefore resumed on her home ICS and prescribed saline and
albuterol nebulizers for comfort. She was provided with 
prescription for tiotropium inhaler at discharge. 

# Atrial fibrillation
Outpatient cardiologist discontinued apixaban last year. Last
admission she had intermittent rates to 150s iso agitation and
dyspnea that resolved with metoprolol 200mg daily. This
medication was discontinued however on discharge to minimize
nonessential meds. 

# Hypertension
Last admission, Losartan was discontinued iso ___ and metoprolol
was discontinued as above. BP well controlled this 
hospitalization.

IMAGING

ADMISSION CXR AP ___
IMPRESSION:  
Bibasilar opacities which could be due to atelectasis noting 
that infection is not entirely excluded.  Cardiomegaly without 
other superimposed acute cardiopulmonary process. 
=========================================
ECG: SR at 77 bpm, no acute changes
========================================
ECHO: ___
The left atrium is normal in size. No atrial septal defect is 
seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thicknesses 
are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is top 
normal/borderline dilated. There is mild to moderate global left 
ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 35-40 %). No masses or thrombi 
are seen in the left ventricle. There is no ventricular septal 
defect. Right ventricular chamber size is normal with mild 
global free wall hypokinesis. The ascending aorta is mildly 
dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally 
normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis or 
aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are structurally 
normal. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid 
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. The pulmonary artery 
systolic pressure could not be determined. There is no 
pericardial effusion

 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ with h/o asthma/? COPD who presents with acute reactive 
airway disease exacerbation improved with CPAP, steroids, 
magnesium and neublizers, question of volume overload/acute 
exacerbation of systolic congestive heart failure as well in 
setting of elevated BNP.

#Dyspnea/acute respiratory distress/rule out acute exacerbation 
of sCHF: 
There was no clear consolidation.  Improved significantly with 
treatment for asthma/COPD exacerbation including standing nebs, 
systemic steroid burst and doxycycline.  It is unclear whether 
she's been taking her nebulizers as prescribed; Dr. ___ 
___ ___ had prescribed all three of albuterol, ipratropium and 
budesonide via nebulizer three times daily, but her duoneb 
prescription is written as "up to 4x per day" so not sure if 
she's taking it scheduled, and she says she's only taking 2 meds 
at a time.  She also had elevated BNP and crackles on exam, 
therefore c/f volume overload.  She was given one dose of IV 
furosemide and put out over 1L with improvement in respiratory 
status.  She is not on home diuretics and this may be considered 
on an outpatient basis but she was not discharged on oral 
diuretics.  Outpatient echo may be considered to re-evaluate her 
systolic function.  Pt will need to finish 2 days of prednisone 
and doxycycline on discharge.  Discharged on home regimen of 
budesonide and albuterol-ipratropium TID with no Spiriva to 
simplify the regimen as per pulmonology plans from outpatient 
records.
She has an appointment with pulmonology two days after 
discharge.

CHRONIC ISSUES
#HTN: Continued ___ and imdur.

#PAD/CAD/HLD: Continued statin and clopidogrel.

#INSOMNIA: Continued remeron.

#CONSTIPATION: Continued senna and miralax.

#OA pain: Continued Tylenol

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES
-Consider outpatient oral diuretics if patient continues to have 
difficulty with volume overload.

**Greater than 30 minutes were spent coordinating and planning 
for discharge.**

Discharge Instructions:
Ms. ___,

It was a pleasure taking care of you while you were admitted at 
___.  You were admitted due to trouble breathing, which we 
think is secondary to an exacerbation of your asthma and a lung 
infection, as well as some extra fluid in your lungs. We gave 
you medications to treat the asthma and an antibiotic and gave 
you a medication to help get rid of the fluid as well.  You 
improved with this.

You will need to take a few more days of prednisone and 
doxycycline at home and then you will be finished with your 
treatment.

Weigh yourself every morning, call MD if weight goes up more 
than 3 lbs.

History of Present Illness:
Ms. ___ is a ___ female with PMH of COPD/asthma, HFrEF
(EF 39%), CAD, PVD, HTN, HLD, with multiple recent admissions,
who presents with chest pain and dyspnea. Per patient's 
daughter,
who is at bedside, she reports that for the past few days she 
had
been feeling unwell, with back pain and increased swelling in
face and legs. She went to her PCP ___ ___ who noted some
dependent edema and recommended elevation of legs, which did not
seem to help. Then early this morning around 5am the patient
started calling out to her daughter, whom she lives with,
complaining of chest pain. She was unable to describe the chest
pain, but noted that it lasted ___ hours and did not improve
with SL nitro or albuterol nebs which the patient had at home.
The daughter then called EMS, who noted the patient to be

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ is a ___ female with PMH of COPD, 
asthma, HFrEF (EF 39%), CAD, PVD, HTN, HLD, with multiple recent 
admissions, who presented with chest pain
and dyspnea.  She was initially found to have PCO2 of 60, pH of 
7.25 and pO2 of 108 on VBG, with tachypnea, tachycardia, and 
increased work of breathing with prolonged expiration.  She was 
admitted to the ICU for BIPAP, but was quickly weaned off to 
room air overnight.  She received 1 dose of IV Lasix 40mg and 
also was treated with nebs.  She had subsequent improvement in 
pCO2 to 47 and pH 7.35.  Her initial respiratory distress seems 
most likely due to acute CHF exacerbation.  Upon transfer to the 
floor, she was in no respiratory distress on room air, but still 
has bibasilar
crackles, so continued on diuresis.  She had mild wheezing. 

ACUTE ISSUES: 
=============
#Respiratory distress: Resolved
#Acute on chronic HFrEF exacerbation:
Patient presented with chest pain, which has been a chronic 
issue, as well as dyspnea. She was found to be hypertensive with 
EMS.  She appeared volume overloaded on exam with bilateral 
pitting edema and bibasilar crackles initially, with CXR showing 
mildly worsened pulmonary edema with BNP (3857) up from prior 
admission.
Respiratory status improved with nitroglycerin, lowering of BP, 
and BiPAP, which also supports a diagnosis of HF exacerbation. 
Initial trop 0.02 with CK 3. No consolidation on CXR and 
afebrile without leukocytosis. She received vancomycin, 
cefepime, azithroycin in the ED, but not continued on admission 
since no evidence of pneumonia.  She was weaned off BIPAP 
overnight on ___ while in ICU.  She still has faint bibasilar 
crackles and trace lower leg edema.  She was treated with PO 
Lasix 80mg daily while on the floor, which was higher than home 
dose of 40mg daily.  She was discharged on 80mg daily, but may 
be able to go back to 40mg daily as outpatient.  She was 
discharged home with ___ to monitor weight, volume status and 
respiratory status.  She was treated with isosorbide dinitrate 
10mg TID and metoprolol 12.5mg Q6H while inpatient but put back 
on her home isosorbide mononitrate 60mg daily and metoprolol XL 
50mg daily on discharge.  Losartan was held due to initially 
elevated Creatinine but resumed on discharge.  Blood cultures 
were negative to date.

#Asthma/COPD: She had initial tachypnea to 28, with increased 
PCO2 of 60, without noted wheezing on exam.  Her initial 
presentation seems more consistent with CHF exacerbation than 
acute COPD or asthma exacerbation.  Family says she uses duonebs
QID at home.  She was treated with Duonebs Q6H plus PRN 
albuterol nebs Q6H.  On discharge she was continued on home 
medications including PRN inhaler.

#CKD: Baseline Creatinine is 1.1-1.5 and was initially at upper 
limit of baseline at 1.5, but improved to 1.3 prior to 
discharge.

#Hyponatremia: This appears to be chronic, as Na varied from 126 
to 133 over past 3 months, though was 139 on admission and again 
on discharge.

#Goals of care:
Patient with multiple recent admissions with similar complaints. 
Family is frustrated, as they do not know how to handle patient 
at home when she starts yelling out for them, which leaves them 
no choice but to bring her back to the ED. ICU team discussed 
with family and she is DNR, okay to intubate for short trial of
life saving measures.
  
CHRONIC ISSUES:  
=============== 
#CAD/PVD: Initial troponin was 0.02 then up to 0.03.  No current 
chest pain.  She was continued on Plavix 75mg daily, Apixaban 
2.5mg BID, statin.

#Elevated INR: She is on Apixaban, which typically should not 
cause this high of INR.  This is chronically elevated to 
1.2-1.6.  She has normal platelets.  She had normal LFTs back in 
___.  No obvious etiology for synthetic dysfunction.  
LFTs were unremarkable.

#HTN: SBP was up to 160s initially, but then was normotensive.  
Losartan was held due to elevated Creatinine but resumed on 
discharge.

#Chronic anemia: Baseline Hemoglobin is ___, no signs of 
active blood loss.

#Depression: Continued Mirtazapine QHS and Gabapentin 300mg BID

#Cognitive impairment/dementia: She is oriented to person and 
place at baseline per her family, so was at baseline.

#Hyperglycemia: Fasting AM glucose has been in the 200s.  A1c 
was 6.5%.  Not on medication for diabetes.

TRANSITION OF CARE ISSUES:
- She is being discharged home with ___.  She should have BMP 
checked by ___ to monitor her electrolytes and renal function.
- She may be able to decrease Lasix from 80mg back to 40mg daily 
depending on volume status.

Check if applies: [ X ] Ms. ___ is clinically stable for 
discharge today. The total time spent today on discharge 
planning, counseling and coordination of care today was greater 
than 30 minutes.

Discharge Instructions:
Ms. ___,

You were hospitalized with difficulty breathing, which is most 
likely due to an exacerbation of your heart failure.  You were 
treated with medication to help remove excess fluid called Lasix 
(furosemide), which will be continued when you leave the 
hospital but at a higher dose than before you came to the 
hospital. Weigh yourself every morning, call MD if weight goes 
up more than 3 lbs.  

Please follow up with your primary doctor within 1 week of 
discharge.  Recommend having your electrolytes and kidney 
function rechecked while you are on higher dose of the Lasix.  
You will have visiting nursing to help monitor your fluid level 
and breathing and can check these labs.

ACUTE ISSUES:
=============
#STEMI
On the day of admission, Ms. ___ was at her day care 
facility when she developed acute-onset exertional chest pain 
and shortness of breath. EMS was called, and she was transported 
to the ___ ED, where EKG showed ST elevations in V3-V6 
suggestive of a medial to distal LAD occlusion. Troponins peaked 
at 4.75. A code STEMI was activated. Based on Ms. ___ age 
and the risks associated with PCI, the decision was made with 
the patient and her family to defer cardiac cath and optimize 
medical management. She was started on anti-ischemic therapy 
encompassing aspirin/clopidogrel/heparin gtt bridged to 
warfarin. In order to mitigate the risk of bleeding, aspirin was 
discontinued once her INR was therapeutic. She was discharged on 
clopidogrel 75 mg daily and warfarin 2.5 mg daily (see below), 
as well as atorvastatin 80 mg daily, imdur 60 mg daily, 
metoprolol succinate 100 mg daily, and lisinopril 5 mg daily.

#Anteroapical akinesis ___ STEMI
TTE status post STEMI showed moderate left ventricular systolic 
dysfunction with apical dyskinesis, anteroapical segmental 
akinesis, and inferior wall akinesis (no evidence of thrombus). 
Prophylactic anticoagulation was started to prevent left 
ventricular thrombus formation. The patient was bridged to 
warfarin on heparin. She was discharged on warfarin 2.5 mg daily 
with a goal INR of ___ her discharge INR was 3.0.

#New systolic heart failure
Admission TTE showed moderate left ventricular systolic 
dysfunction with an LVEF 35-40%. The patient remained euvolemic 
on exam throughout her hospital course, so a diuretic was 
deferred at discharge. She was discharged on lisinopril, imdur, 
and metoprolol as above.

#COPD
Ms. ___ did not require supplemental oxygen during her 
hospital course, and her pulmonary exam remained stable without

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,  

 WHY WAS I IN THE HOSPITAL?  
 ==========================  
 - You were admitted because you had a heart attack  
 
 WHAT HAPPENED IN THE HOSPITAL?  
 ==============================  
  - You were admitted to the hospital because you had chest 
pain. You were found to have had a heart attack. You were given 
medications to prevent future blockages.
 
 WHAT SHOULD I DO WHEN I GO HOME?  
 ================================    
 - It is very important to take your medications every day.
 - These medications help reduce your risk of having a future 
heart attack. One of your medications, called warfarin (or 
Coumadin) also reduces your risk of developing a blood clot that 
can cause a stroke. 
 - Please do not stop taking your medications without talking to 
your heart doctor.
 - These medications that help your heart include atorvastatin, 
clopidogrel (or Plavix), imdur, lisinopril, metoprolol, and as 
mentioned above, warfarin (or Coumadin). 
 - While you were admitted to the hospital, you were also 
treated for a condition called heart failure, where your heart 
does not pump hard enough and fluid can back up into your lungs.
 - Your weight at discharge is 117 lbs. Please weigh yourself 
today at home and use this as your new baseline.
 - Please weigh yourself every day in the morning. Call your 
doctor if your weight goes up by more than 3 lbs.

medically managed per family decision, also with HTN, PVD, 
asthma and COPD presenting with acute dyspnea, chest pain and 
AMS likely in setting of aspiration event at home all of which 
are now resolved. 

ACUTE ISSUES
============
# Dysphagia:
# Aspiration event:
Patient had acute onset dyspnea overnight on ___ prompting ED
admission. Per history, patient intermittently develops this and
likely related to aspirations. In the ED, she did not receive 
antibiotic because she did not appear to have PNA clinically. 
However, she had continued dyspnea on the medicine floor for 
which she was treated for COPD exacerbation with improvement 
with treatment. 
- Consider S&S re-evaluation as outpatient, with emphasis on 
teaching with family to prevent recurrence at home 
- Dysphagia diet: pureed solids, nectar pre-thickened liquids

# Goals of ___
Previous ___ discussions have occurred both 
inpatient/outpatient.
Patient was full code during previous admission. Daughter
reported mother asked her not to call EMS and "wanted to die at
home" but daughter called EMS given her concern. Would continue
to re-address. 
- Continue to address ___

# ___ - resolving
Cr 1.2 from prior baseline of 0.9. Likely pre-renal I/s/o known
decreased PO intake at home and possible contribution from 
possible hypotension in setting of SLNG doses at home. Now 
resolving to 1.1 with increased PO intake. 

# Type II NSTEMI - resolved
Likely demand I/s/o hypotensive episode after taking SL NTG. 
Troponin elevation 0.02 and patient has no chest pain currently. 
Will defer heparin gtt given type II event. 

# AMS - resolved 
Patient became unresponsive at home after
receiving Nitroglycerin SL x3. Patient was endorsing "chest 
pain"
which was likely non-cardiac in origin and related to aspiration
event. Her elevated lactate on admission which rapidly resolved
was likely due to this. 

CHRONIC ISSUES

History of Present Illness:
Ms. ___ is an ___ ___ woman with PMH of CAD 
(NSTEMI s/p stent left circumflex & RCA in ___, HTN, HLD, PVD 
and asthma who presents with dyspnea. Pt reports that the 
shortness of breath began during adult day-care today, around 
12PM. It began suddenly, which she states is usually the case 
for her asthma attacks. She was given O2 in the center and her 
SOB improved. The SOB worsened when she was off the O2 on her 
way home. Upon her arrival home, she appeared in distress to her 
daughter, tachypneic, and she had a supported fall. Her SOB did 
not improve with albuterol and so her daughter called an 
ambulance. She reports very mild CP associated with this attack 
today. She denies fevers, chills, palpitations, syncope, leg 
swelling, orthopnea, or PND.

She began having episodic SOB and was diagnosed with asthma 
about ___ years ago. She has been having daily SOB asthma attacks 
which usually improve with albuterol. However, possibly due to 
incorrect use of her inhaler, she is usually out of her 
albuterol before she can get another one. On a few occasions, 
she had to use her daughter's inhaler to control her attacks. 
She is not recieving any other treatment for her asthma at the 
moment. Today's attack seemed the most severe in these ___ years. 
 
In the ED, initial vital signs were 98.4 67 147/67 24 100% 10L

and CBC with eosinophilia. Trop-T: <0.01, BNP EKG showed NSR @ 
54, LVH, lateral st depressions (old) no STE or new ischemic 
changes. CXR was negative for pulmonary edema or infiltrate. 
Patient was given duonebs x4, magnesium 2g, and 
methylprednisolone 125mg. Pt improved with treatment but still 
very tight on exam.

On transfer Vitals were BP 109/55 HR 58, RR 14, 99% O2 on 6L

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ is an ___ ___ woman with PMH of CAD 
(NSTEMI with stent placement to left circumflex & RCA in ___, 
and asthma who presents with dyspnea from likely asthma 
exacerbation/reactive airway disease.

# SOB: Pt with severe dyspnea on admission with hypoxia 
requiring non-rebreather. Patient takes 
combivent(albuterol/ipratropium) and fluticasone as an 
outpatient consistent with reactive airway disease. Concurrent 
COPD is also a possibility with pt's smoking hx and increased 
severity of SOB. She was treated with steroids and 
albuterol/ipratropium nebulizers and her symptoms improved and 
she was able to be weaned to room air. On discharge her 
Ambulatory O2 sat was 93%RA and resting O2 sat 95%RA. She was 
discharged on prednisone 40mg for total 10 days, Advair, 
albuterol, and Spiriva. She was also provided with a nebulizer 
for albuterol. Should consider PFTs as an outpatient once 
current exacerbation resolves to determine underlying 
physiology. She was discharged with a nebulizer for albuterol 
treatments as well.
