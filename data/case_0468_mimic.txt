Pertinent Results:
(On admission)
.
Pelvic U/S with Doppler (___): 1. Large complex cystic mass 
with thick septations and irregular wall in the right adnexa. 
The lesion is concerning for an ovarian neoplasm such as 
cystadenocarcinoma and surgical resection has to be considered. 
2. Both ovaries not identified; cannot exclude torsion. 
.
Echocardiogram (___): Normal biventricular cavity sizes with 
preserved global and regional biventricular systolic function. 
.
___: Current study demonstrates new left lower lobe 
opacity accompanied by pleural effusions that may potentially 
represent interval development of infectious process or 
aspiration. No evidence of pneumothorax or evidence of pulmonary 
edema. 

___: The ET tube tip is 4 cm above the carina. The NG tube 
tip is in the stomach.  There is still presence of complete 
consolidation of the left lower lung, but some aeration of the 
left upper lung is noted with decrease in the mediastinal shift. 
The right lower lobe consolidation continues to increase and is 
worrisome for developing infectious process

___: Right PICC line tip is at the level of cavoatrial 
junction/proximal right atrium and should be pulled back for 
approximately 1.5 cm. There is significant improvement of the 
left lung aeration. In contrary there is growing right lower 
lobe consolidation highly worrisome for pneumonia or aspiration 
pneumonia. The rest of the findings are unchanged. 

___: Previous left lung collapse has cleared in the left 
upper lobe and some of the lower, progressive improvement since 
___. Consolidation in the mid region of the right lung has 
increased apparently, while consolidation at the base has either 
improved or is now obscured by posteriorly collected right 
pleural effusion. Overall, findings point to compromised airway, 
presumably due to secretions. Mild-to-moderate cardiomegaly and 
pulmonary vascular congestion with mediastinal venous 
engorgement also indicate some cardiac decompensation, but I do 
not see edema. Small pleural effusion may be present 
on the left as well. ET tube is in standard placement, 
nasogastric tube 
passes below the diaphragm and out of view. Right PIC catheter 
can be traced to the mid SVC. 

___: There is mild-to-moderate cardiomegaly. The lungs are 
hyperinflated. Small bilateral pleural effusions are larger on 
the left side. Bibasilar atelectasis are improved. Mild 
pulmonary congestion has improved. Previously described right 
apical opacity has improved. There are no new lung 
abnormalities. Right PICC remains in place. 
.
Bilateral LENIS ___: IMPRESSION: No DVT in both lower 
extremities.

Brief Hospital Course:
___ year old female with HTN, asthma, CAD s/p MI in ___, and 
DM2, who was admitted to the hospital with worsening abdominal 
pain, nausea and vomiting with right sided pelvic mass. She 
underwent a total abdominal hysterectomy with BSO for torsed 
ovarian cyst. 

*) Pulmonary: Ms. ___ post-operative course was complicated 
by an extended oxygen requirement necessitating admission to the 
FICU on POD#0 and again on POD# 2. She was ultimately intubated 
in the FICU and started on IV antibiotics for presumed 
aspiration and hospital acquired pneumonia. She was ultimately 
extubated on ___ and her oxygen requirement decreased. On 
transfer to the floor, she was only requiring nasal canula 
during the day and CPAP at night. Her pulmonary status continued 
to improve and she was completely weaned off O2. Medicine was 
asked to consult to help optimize her COPD. She was started and 
mainatined on Advair, Spiriva and Albuterol.

*) Infectious Disease: Ms. ___ was diagnosed with a hospital 
acquired pneumonia and aspiration. She was initially placed on 
unasyn in the FICU, but transitioned to Cipro/Vanc/Zosyn. Her 
leukocytosis initially improved, but on ___ her WBC again 
trended up. ID was asked to consult and the recommendation was 
made to transition to Vancomycin and Meropenem. Her WBC improved 
and she remained afebrile. She completed a 12 day course of 
Vancomycin and 7 day course of Meropenem. She was treated with 1 
dose of Diflucan for a positive yeast urine culture. Her blood 
cultures were negative. 

*) Ovarian Mass: She was found to have right ovarian torsion as 
well as a benign left ovarian mass.  She was treated surgically 
with TAH-BSO on ___.  She did well from a surgical 
standpoint post-operatively. She was voiding, ambulating and 
tolerating a regular diet prior to discharge.

*) Hypertension/Hx of MI: Ms. ___ was started on Metoprolol 
for hypertension. Her blood pressures remained well controlled. 
She was also started on a statin and baby ASA for 
cardio-protection.

*) DM2: Uncontrolled HgbA1C greater than 13%. Her fingersticks 
were monitored and she was started on an insulin regimen 
including ___ lantus and humalog with meals. Her blood sugars 
were under much better control. She will continue this regimen 
as an outpatient and follow-up with her PCP. 

*) Depression: Patient was initially started on Paxil, but then 
transitioned to Zoloft 50mg which she stated had worked for her 
in past. 

*) Tobacco Abuse: we continued a nicotine patch
