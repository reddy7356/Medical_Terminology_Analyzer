Brief Hospital Course:
The patient presented as a direct admit to the floor and was 
admitted to the  vascular surgery service. He was noted to have 
a nonhealing gangrene on ___ ankle w/exposed tendon. He was 
started on Vanc/Cipro/Flagyl in a renally dosed fashion. He was 
started on a heparin drip for anticoagulation, however his PTT's 
remained subtherapeutic. He was switched to an argatroban drip 
and his PTTs remained therapeutic during his hospitalization. 

Plastic surgery was consulted to determine if he would be a 
candidate for coverage of the wound- their recs were that the 
patient had significant gangrene and would need 
revascularization prior to coverage; additionally he was a high 
risk cardiac candidate and would require cardiac clearance prior 
to any ability to provide tissue coverage.  Cardiology assessed 
the patient and felt he had extremely high cardiac risk for 
intraoperative morbidity and mortality; furthermore the patients 
___ vasculature was not optimal it was deemed he was not a 
revascularization candidate.  As such, it was determined he 
would need a BKA and on ___ he underwent a Right Below Knee 
Amputation which the patient tolerated well.  For full details 
of the procedure please see the separately dictated operative 
report. The patient was taken from the OR to the PACU in stable 
condition and after satisfactory recovery from anesthesia was 
transferred to the vascular step down unit.  The patient's home 
medications and home HD schedule were continued throughout this 
hospitalization. The Chronic Pain Service was consulted for pain 
management and their recs were followed. 

The patient was continued on IV antibiotics vanc, cipro, flagyl 
for 10 days post-op for some concern of erythema and drainage 
around the stump, and a wound vac was placed. Patient recovered 
well post-operatively and remained in the hospital for bridge to 
warfarin using argatroban and titration of argatroban. Once the 
patient's INR reached 4, the argatroban was discontinued and the 
warfarin dosing was adjusted to the patient's home dose to allow 
the INR to reach therapeutic level (___). Patient is discharged 
today with INR of 2.7, on all of his home meds, including 
warfarin 1mg daily as per his home regimen, and with wound vac 
change instructions (every three days) given to his rehab unit.

Discharge Instructions:
Mr. ___,
It was a pleasure taking care of you at ___ 
___.  During your hospitalization, you had surgery to 
remove unhealthy tissue on your lower extremity.  You tolerated 
the procedure well and are now ready to be discharged from the 
hospital.   Please follow the recommendations below to ensure a 
speedy and uneventful recovery.

LOWER  EXTREMITY AMPUTATION 
DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS
ACTIVITY 
•You should keep your amputation site elevated and straight 
whenever possible.  This will prevent swelling of the stump and 
maintain flexibility in your joint.  
•It is very important that you put no weight or pressure on 
your stump with activity or at rest to allow the wound to heal 
properly. 
•You may use the opposite foot for transfers and pivots, if 
applicable.  It will take time to learn to use a walker and 
learn to transfer into and out of a wheelchair.  

MEDICATION
•Before you leave the hospital, you will be given a list of all 
the medicine you should take at home.  If a medication that you 
normally take is not on the list or a medication that you do not 
take is on the list please discuss it with the team!  
•You will likely be prescribed narcotic pain medication on 
discharge which  can be very constipating.  If you take 
narcotics,  please also take a stool softener such as Colace.   
If constipation becomes a problem, your pharmacist can suggest 
an additional over the counter laxative. 
•You should take Tylenol ___ every 6 hours, as needed for 
pain.  If this is not enough, take your prescription narcotic 
pain medication.  You should require less pain medication each 
day.  Do not take more than a daily total of 3000mg of Tylenol.  
Tylenol is used as an ingredient in some other over-the-counter 
and prescription medications.  Be aware of how much Tylenol you 
are taking in a day.

BATHING/SHOWERING: 
•You may shower when you feel strong enough but no tub baths or 
pools until you have permission from your surgeon and the 
incision is fully healed.
•After your shower, gently dry the incision well.   Do not rub 
the area. 

WOUND CARE:
•Please keep the wound clean and dry. It is very important that 
there is no pressure on the stump.    If there is no drainage, 
you may leave the incision open to air.  
•Your staples/sutures will remain in for at least 4 weeks.  At 
your followup appointment, we will see if the incision has 
healed enough to remove the staples. 
•Before you can be fitted for prosthesis (a man-made limb to 
replace the limb that was removed) your incision needs to be 
fully healed.

___. Patient was monitored on telemetry and transitioned to IV 
Cefazolin for antibiotic management, per recs from ID. ICD was 
removed on ___ by EP, there were no complications. 
Patient to receive a total of 6 weeks of treatment w/ IV 
Cefazolin (end date ___.

#Ventricular arrhythmia
Hx of life threatening arrhythmia requiring ICD placement. Now 
s/p ICD removal. Occasional betas of self limited ventricular 
tachycardia. Per discussion w/ patient and w/ EP, no current 
indications for a life vest, given ICD never fired and patient's 
episodes in the hospital were self limited. Patient will f/u w/ 
EP as an outpatient to discuss reinsertion of the ICD.

#Anemia
Hemoglobin 
Hemoglobin steadily dropped during hospitalization, trough of 
5.4, requiring 2U PRBCs. Patient's hemoglobin responded 
appropriately, increased to 7 and stabilized. Likely 
multi-factorial ___ to ESRD, anemia of chronic disease, and iron 
deficiency anemia. Pt's labs w/out evidence of hemolytic anemia 
and no evidence of active bleeding. Epogen started with dialysis 
sessions. 

#HFrEF (30%): 
Euvolemic. Was discharged from OSH w/ Furosemide 4x a week. No 
dieuresis during this hospitalization. Switched diuretic to 
non-dialysis days. 

CHRONIC ISSUES
==============
#ESRD: 
Nephrology was consulted and patient was maintained on dialysis 
___. HD line replaced ___. Also increased home sevelamer to 
1600mg TID w/ meals and added epogen to dialysis sessions.

#DIARRHEA: 
Associated with antibiotics. C.diff negative at ___ on ___. 
Continued loperamide.

#TYPE II DIABETES
#DKA (resolved at ___): 
Patient was maintained on insulin glargine 17U qAM & sliding 
scale insulin. Home oral anti-hyperglycemic agents resumed at 
discharge. 

#PRURITIS: 
Recent history of scabies but seemed to be resolved 
post-treatment with ivermectin. Given general poor self care, 
consulted social work.

#AF
#HISTORY OF CARDIOEMBOLIC STROKE: 
CHADS2VASC of 6, didn't seem to be on any anticoagulation prior 
to d/c. Was continued on argatroban, given questionable hx of 
HIT (later confirmed negative). Initially planning for Warfarin, 
but given patient's difficulty with outpatient follow up, 
decided on Apixaban instead (with renal approval).

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
===================
#MSSA Bacteremia:
#ICD Removal:
[ ] Continue Cefazolin (dosed after HD- 2mg IV M/W, 3mg IV F) 
until ___.
[ ] Suture removal ___.
[ ] F/u with EP to discuss risk benefit of ICD replacement.

#Atrial Fibrillation:
[ ] Started on Apixaban 5mg BID (with renal approval)
[ ] Metoprolol consolidated to 75mg of succinate daily 
(discontinued tartrate 12.5mg BID)

#Anemia:
Suspect ___ ESRD, no evidence bleeding. 
[ ] Check labs with next dialysis session to ensure Hg not 
dropping further (threshold for transfusion < 7). Dose Epogen 
with dialysis per renal recs. 
[ ] Colonoscopy per regular screening guidelines 

#Diarrhea:
C-diff negative, likely related to antibiotics. 
[ ] Started loperamide. Continue at least until antibiotics 
finish, then DC. 

#Heparin:
[ ] On review of OMR with pharmacist, patient DOES NOT have a 
history of HIT (SRA was negative). Therefore ok for patient to 
receive heparin products.

#Back Pain
Patient on Oxycontin SR 20mg daily. 
[ ] Added short acting oxycodone 5mg TID prn while inpatient. 
Written for 5d script at rehab. Titrate as tolerated. 
[ ] Continue good bowel regimen.

#DM
Patient given 17u glargine insulin while inpatient for 
management of diabetes. Given low healthcare literacy and 
complex medication regimen already, switched back to oral agent 
at discharge. 
[ ] Monitor HgA1c and consider insulin in future if 
uncontrolled.  

#ESRD:
[ ] Continue dialysis MWF
[ ] Increased sevelamer to 1600 TID
[ ] Added Epogen to dialysis sessions
[ ] Switched diuretic to 40mg Lasix on NON-dialysis days. 

#Healthcare Maintenance:
[ ] Hep B Series should be initiated outpatient 
[ ] Speech/swallow recommended outpatient workup of patient's 
dysphagia if it persists (GI referral).

possibly severe (holosystolic flow
reversal seen proximally in a hepatic vein clip 69 that is 
discordant with amount of color flow, but the TR was not well 
visualized in the apical views and could have been 
UNDERestimated. No valvular vegetations. If clinically 
suggested, the absence of a discrete vegetation on
echocardiography does not exclude the diagnosis of endocarditis. 
No prior study is available for comparison (but EF 20% known 
from ___ echos).

IMPRESSION:  
There is a impacted fracture of the subcapital portion of the 
right femur.  The alignment is unchanged from previous.  There 
is no gross bony destruction to indicate radiographic signs for 
acute osteomyelitis or septic hip. However, if there is high 
clinical concern for joint infection, MRI could be performed.  
There are extensive vascular calcifications.  The patient is 
status post below the knee amputation.  There is extensive 
demineralization. 

HIP ASPIRATION ___
IMPRESSION: 1. Technically successful aspiration of right hip.

right 
occipital lobe and in the left occipital white matter. 
2. Indeterminate foci of FLAIR hyperintensity in the cortex or 
subcortical 
white matter in the left frontal lobe and left parietal lobe, 
unable to be 
adequately evaluated due to the degree of motion degradation on 
this study.  Note that this noncontrast study is not sensitive 
in evaluating for the presence of meningitis/cerebritis. 
3. Chronic right frontal and left temporal lobe infarcts. 
4. Multiple bilateral chronic cerebellar infarcts. 
5. Mild global parenchymal volume loss. 
6. Trace right mastoid effusion.

Brief Hospital Course:
Brief FICU Course:
==================
Patient was admitted on ___ with altered mental status after 
missing dialysis on ___. ___ was admitted with a mild acidosis 
and hyperuremia and received HD on ___ with improvement in 
his mental status. ___ was mildly hypotensive after HD and 
received 2 250 cc fluid boluses with normalization of his 
pressures. 

On ___, blood cultures returned positive for GPCs, concern 
for a likely HD line infection. ___ was continued on vancomycin. 
On ___, cultures returned positive for MRSA. His left femoral 
HD line was removed on ___ and a temporary right femoral HD 
line was placed on ___. ___ was persistently bactermeic, and 
underwent TEE on ___ which showed no vegetations with 
moderate TR/MR. ___ also complained of right hip pain, concerning 
for seeding of his previously known fractured hip. ___ underwent 
___ guided aspiration of the hip joint on ___ which showed 
staph aureus similar to his blood cultures.

On admission, Urinalysis was concerning for a urinary tract 
infection and patient was started on zosyn, later switched to 
cefepime and flagyl. His urine culture returned positive for 
MRSA which was likely hematogenous spread from his bacteremia. 
Cefepime/flagyl were then discontinued. 

On admission, ___ was noted to have cholelithiasis and a dilated 
CBD on ct/abd pelvis with associated hyperbilirubinemia but no 
Transaminitis. Given his relative clinical stability and blood 
cultures being positive with MRSA, MRCP was deferred. 

Throughout his time in the ICU ___ continued to have blood 
cultures positive for MRSA despite appropriate antibiotic 
treatment. Discontinuation of central venous access was not 
possible due to continued need for central venous access 
medications and hemodialysis.  His clinical status continued to 
deteriorate requiring pressors to maintain his blood pressure. 
On ___ around 1430 patient became severely bradycardic and 
eventually lost his pulse. CPR was started and ROSC was 
temporarily obtained. ___ subsequently coded again for PEA 
arrest. Resuscitation was attempted but ultimately was not 
achieved. Patient was pronounced at the bedside.  Family was 
contacted.

IMAGING
=======
RUQ/US ___
Cholelithiasis with nonmobile stones at the gallbladder neck in 
a somewhat 
distended gallbladder.  No other findings to suggest acute 
cholecystitis.  
Clinical correlation will be necessary. 

EGD ___
Grade C esophagitis in the distal esophagus
Erythema in the stomach compatible with gastritis
Ulcers in the antrum
Erosions in the duodenal bulb
Ulcer in the duodenal bulb
Recommendations:
Large duodenal ulcer most likely etiology of bleeding. No active 
bleeding, visible vessel or adherent clot.

CXR ___
Lungs clear.  Heart size normal.  No pleural abnormality.  Left 
PIC line ends in the low SVC.  To channel right supraclavicular 
central venous lines end in the region of the superior 
cavoatrial junction.

CXR ___
In comparison with the study of ___, the left subclavian 
PICC line has been removed.  No definite opacity is seen within 
the prior course of the tube, though this would be difficult to 
unequivocally exclude due to the overlying hemodialysis catheter 
and midline sternal wires.
Otherwise, little change in the appearance of the heart and 
lungs.

Brief Hospital Course:
BRIEF HOSPITAL SUMMARY
======================
___ y.o. gentleman with ischemic cardiomyopathy (EF 15% 
___, IDDM c/b ESRD (iHD MWF), CAD s/p CABG, Afib w/ h/o 
cardioembolic stroke (on Eliquis) and h/o L atrial appendage 
clot, MSSA bacteremia & ICD pacer lead vegetation s/p ICD 
explant ___ on cefazolin, bilateral BKA who presented with 
coffee ground emesis and melena concerning for upper GI bleed in 
setting of supratherapreutic INR with EGD revealing of large 
duodenal ulcer as likely source of bleeding. Suspect that 
supratherapeutic INR was reflective of a hypoprothrombinemia in 
the setting of a genetic mutation (TPMT) which prevents 
metabolization of cefazolin side chains and increases bleeding 
risk. Patient stabilized after 3 transfusions, started on PPI, 
and antibiotics were switched to Vancomycin for the remainder of 
his course. 
 
ACUTE ISSUES
=============
#GI BLEED: Presented after initial episode of coffee ground 
emesis and melena with hypotension, slight decrease in 
hemoglobin from most recent discharge (7.1 -> 6.3) but 
inappropriate response to 3 units pRBCs. Concern for upper GI 
bleed likely exacerbated by comorbidities, anticoagulation, and 
elevated INR (see below regarding coagulopathy). He denied any 
recent NSAID use. EGD revealing of large duodenal ulcer most 
likely etiology of bleeding, without intervention. He received a 
total of 6 units PRBCs. He was maintained on IV PPI BID and 
transitioned to PO which should be continued for 8 weeks, then 
transitioned to daily dosing in setting of aspirin use. 
Discharged with hemoglobin of 7.6.
 
#COAGULOPATHY: INR on admission 14.9. Received k-centra in ED 
with improvement in INR to 1.9, then uptrended again to 3.1 for 
unclear reasons. Hematology was consulted a felt cefazolin side 
chain may be cauing hypoprothrombinemia, recommended avoiding 
cephalosporins in the future which we added to his allergy list. 
Ultimately decided to anticoagulate with warfarin due to ESRD. 
Bridged with heparin due to history of embolic CVA. Discharge 
INR was 2.8.

#MSSA ENDOCARDITIS: Intially presented with pus from HD line in 
___, subsequently found to have ICD lead infection, s/p 
ICD explant ___ and on cefazolin for ___ - 
___, which was transitioned to vancomycin given concern for 
cefazolin related coagulopathy as above. Vancomycin dosed with 
HD. Will continue to follow with OPAT (full recs in TRANSITIONAL 
ISSUES below). 

#ISCHEMIC CARDIOMYOPATHY, HFrEF (15%): ICD for primary 
prevention for ___ years without shock delivered. Had ICD 
explanted I/s/o bacteremia and pacer lead infection as above. 
Home Lasix and lisinopril were held initially in setting of GIB. 
Metoprolol was fractionated. After GIB stabilized, consolidated 
metoprolol and restarted lisinopril and Will follow-up with EP 
to discuss potential for new ICD after completion of antibiotic 
course.

#AFIB: History of cardioembolic stroke, CHADs2VASC 6.  Held home 
apixaban on admission I/s/o GIB. Decision to change to warfarin 
as INR in setting of ESRD.
 
#CAD S/P CABG: Elevated troponin on admission but flat CK-MB 
likely due to ESRD. No chest pain or ischemic ECG changes. Home 
ASA initially held, then restarted after EGD. He was continued 
on home atorvastatin.
 
#ESRD: Secondary to diabetic nephropathy for which he receives 
iHD on MWF.  Continued HD and sevelamer.
 
#DM2: Held home glimepiride. SSI and glargine once PO intake 
restarted.
  
#CHRONIC BACK PAIN: Held home oxycontin due to hypotension in 
setting of GIB. Oxycodone used about twice daily as well as 
lidocaine patch. Oxycontin discontinued at discharged, as 
patient did not require it. 

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
====================

left ___ toe was more dark than the last time you ere seen in 
clinic and it was decided to admit you to ___ 
___ on ___ for work-up and IV antibiotics 
vancomycin /ciprofloxacin/flagyl). During your hospitalization a 
dye study was performed which showed that your left leg bypass 
was occluded. For this reason you underwent a second procedure 
with a dye study and blood thinners in order to recanalize the 
graft (lysis procedure on ___. The next day (___) we 
repeated the dye study and we saw that your graft was reopened. 
However your left ___ toe because gangrenous and we had to 
proceed to it amputation on ___. During your hospitalization 
you had sessions of hemodialysis and we switched you from 
Coumadin to Apixaban (a different blood thinner) given the 
failure of coumadin to keep the graft open. Physical therapy was 
consulted and suggested that you could be cleared for Home with 
Services. Once you were tolerating a diet, able to urinate and 
move from your wheelchair to the bed with assistance we 
discharged you on an oral antibiotic (minocycline for 2 weeks)

Brief Hospital Course:
History of Present Illness:
___ year old man with a past medical history notable for DM, ESRD 

on HD (___), ischemic cardiomyopathy with EF of ___, PAD 

s/p R BKA and most recently a L BK ___ bypass w/ NRSVG in 
___, Left ___ toe amputation in ___. Presents with
L3rd and ___ toe ischemia and possible infection, and right BKA
site non healing ulcer. On the left patients reports left
forefoot pain on touch, warmth, mild swelling and stiffness. he
denies any fever, chills, sweating, abdominal pain, tachycardia,
or SOB. patient reports small non-healing right BKA site ulcer,
started after the right BKA (___) surgery and hasn't healed
since.   

___: He was admitted to vascular surgery, eliquis held, 
subq hep started, abx vanc/cipro/flagyl started, OR scheduled 
fro LLE angiogram on ___.

___: He underwent Left lower extremity angiogram and based 
on his angio and Given that the peroneal artery is the sole 
runoff for the left lower extremity and any endovascular attempt 
to recanalize the distal SFA with a BK
popliteal segment occlusion would be too risky, would risk
damaging the sole runoff to the foot.  At this time, we planed 
for a revision of the right BKA stump and will plan for a left 
lower extremity fem to peroneal bypass with likely cadaveric 
vein in the future.  Given that the former left lower extremity
BK pop to ___ bypass is completely occluded and is non 
salvageable at this time, we stopped the heparin drip for the 
patient.

On ___: patient went for his weekly HD and the went to the 
OR for Revision below knee amputation right leg. He tolerated 
the procedure well and was transferred to the PACU and then to 
the floor in stable condition.

___: HD line replaced by ___.

___: patient went for his HD and his home restarted on his 
home Apixaban and Sertraline. 

___: He was put back on his home medication and  switched 
to Bactrim for 10 days(ID was consulted and the dosage was 
confirmed by the pharmacy) for antibiotics coverage. Patients 
was not accepted at acute rehab facility and he refused SNF.

___: He was discharge home with ___ in stable condition.

s/p R BKA and multiple b/l ___ vascular procedures presenting for 
preadmission for left fem-peroneal bypass with cryo vein. 
Patient was recently admitted ___ for LLE angio on 
___ and R BKA revision on ___. LLE angio showed a short 
segment of distal SFA stenosis of less than 1 cm, the below knee 
popliteal to ___ bypass graft was completely occluded with only 
the hood of the bypass graft visible.  There was also a short 
segment occlusion of the below-knee popliteal segment of about 1 
cm in length, right above the anterior tibial takeoff.  The 
anterior tibial takeoff was visualized but then occludes soon 
after its takeoff.  There is a patent tibioperoneal trunk with 
an occluded posterior tibial artery.  The only runoff to the 
foot is the peroneal artery which also has a short 15 mm segment 
of occlusion proximally, but then reconstitutes as a
patent peroneal that provides runoff to the foot and supplies 
the dorsalis pedis as well as the hindfoot. No endovascular 
intervention was attempted at this time, with plans for bypass 
in the near future. BKA revision was done for a small dime-sized 
ulceration on the distal aspect of his right BKA site. He
endorses LLE rest pain and has had left ___ and ___ toe 
nonhealing ulcers/gangrene for several months. He was discharged 
on Bactrim and completed the course 2 days ago.

changes from 
baseline. Blunted hemodynamic response to the Persantine 
infusion. 
Nuclear report sent separately. 
 

Cardiac perfusion Pharm
FINDINGS:  
  
The image quality is adequate but limited due to soft tissue 
attenuation and 
motion.  The lung-heart ratio is increased at 0.52.   
  
Left ventricular cavity size is increased. 
  
Rest and stress perfusion images reveal a predominantly fixed, 
severe reduction 
in photon counts involving the entire inferior wall and the mid 
and basal 
inferolateral walls.   
  
Gated images reveal akinesis of the entire inferior wall and the 
mid and basal 
inferolateral walls.  The remaining segments are hypokinetic.   
  
The calculated left ventricular ejection fraction is 19% with an 
EDV of 375 ml. 
  
IMPRESSION: 
  
1. Predominantly fixed, large, severe perfusion defect involving 
the RCA 
territory. 
  
2. Increased left ventricular cavity size.  Severe systolic 
dysfunction with 
akinesis of the entire inferior wall and the mid and basal 
inferolateral wall, 
with hypokinesis of the remaining segments.   
  

 
Brief Hospital Course:
Patient was admitted for IV antibiotics for a concerning right 
BKA stump infection. Patient was initially placed on broad 
spectrum empiric coverage. A swab of the wound was done, 
cultures grew staph aureus coag positive. Patient responded well 
to antibiotics with decreased erythema, edema and purulent 
drainage and less pain. The infection seems to have resolved and 
wound looks stable. Patient will be sent home with a short 
course of minocycline. Patient unable to do Bactrim due to 
severe interaction with his home medications. Daily dressing 
changes occurred during his admission and will continue once 
discharged until wound has healed. 

During admission patient developed purpura painful lesions on 
his left foot. Upon close evaluation it was determined the 
lesions are most likely ischemic in nature. Non invasive 
arterial studies, as well as vein mapping was obtained. Patient 
also underwent a diagnostic angiogram that showed significant 
stenosis. It is recommended patient undergo a lower extremity 
bypass in an attempt to re-vascularize the leg. A bypass was 
scheduled during the admission but due to extensive cardiac 
history, cardiovascular team was consulted and asked for a risk 
stratification. Patient was deemed high risk due to extensive 
cardiac history. Further testing was needed including a nuclear 
stress test. The planned operation was cancelled until patient 
receives cardiac clearance. Patient will pursue bypass at a 
later date once cleared. Patient will proceed with bypass at a 
later date pending cardiac clearance. 

Patient was seen and evaluated for the cardiovascular team for 
pre-operative clearance. Patient was deemed high risk based on 
history and further diagnostic testing was required, nuclear 
stress test was ordered. The original date of bypass was 
postponed per recommendations of the cardiovascular service 
until results of study were obtained. Patient was sent for 
stress testing. Upon final recommendations from cardiology, they 
states he is cleared for a future bypass procedure, his heart 
disease does not appear to acute. They recommended outpatient 
follow up with a cardiologist. 

During the admission, home Coumadin was stopped and heparin drip 
was started. Prior to a procedure being planned, Coumadin was 
restarted but it was found patient did not become therapeutic 
after several days. During the middle of the admission it was 
determined the patient would benefit from a bypass procedure. 
Coumadin was once again stopped and heparin drip started in 
anticipation for the procedure. When it was determined the 
procedure was canceled, it was determined apixiban would be 
preferred on a temporary basis until the procedure can occur. 
The plan is to restart the Coumadin once the bypass procedure it 
complete.  

OPERATIVE REPORT:
=================
Surgeon:  ___, ___

ASSISTANT:  ___.

PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  Nonhealing ulcers of the left toes.

POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  Nonhealing ulcers of the left toes.

PROCEDURES:
1. Ultrasound-guided access to the right common femoral
    artery.
2. Selective catheterization of the left external iliac
    artery, ___ order vessel.
3. Abdominal aortogram.
4. Left lower extremity diagnostic angiogram.

CONTRAST VOLUME:  70 cc Visipaque.

FLUOROSCOPY TIME:  3.4 minutes.

RADIATION DOSE:  55 mGy.

INDICATIONS:  This is a ___ gentleman with a history
of diabetes, end-stage renal disease on dialysis, and
ischemic cardiomyopathy with an EF of 10% to 15% with a long
history of peripheral arterial disease.  He previously
underwent a right-sided popliteal to DP bypass, which
subsequently failed and culminated in a right BKA.  He
recently presented for wound complications of that right BKA,
but it was also noted at the time that he had nonhealing
ulcers of left toes.  He was thus consented for a left lower
extremity angiogram.

DETAILS OF PROCEDURE:  The patient was brought to the
operating room and placed supine on the OR table.  His
bilateral groins were prepped and draped in the usual sterile
fashion.  Monitored sedation was provided with divided doses
of fentanyl Versed.  We performed a time out.  We began by
evaluating the right common femoral artery under direct
ultrasound visualization.  This was noted to be patent and
free of limiting calcification.  Therefore, under direct
ultrasound visualization, the right common femoral artery was
accessed with a micropuncture needle.  Images of the
ultrasound guidance were stored in the ___ medical
record for documentation purposes.  We confirmed the level of
arterial puncture using fluoroscopy to be over the right
femoral head.  We then placed a ___ sheath in the right
groin and advanced an Omni Flush catheter into the aorta to
the level of the L1 vertebral body.  An abdominal aortogram
was then performed.  It revealed a patent infrarenal
abdominal aorta, which was free of ectasia or aneurysm or
flow limiting stenosis.  The bilateral iliac systems were
widely patent.  Next using the Omni Flush catheter and a
floppy Glidewire, we were able to get up and over the aortic
bifurcation and selected the left external iliac artery, ___
order vessel.  We then proceeded with the left lower
extremity diagnostic angiogram.  This revealed a patent left
common femoral artery, profunda and SFA.  The left popliteal
artery was patent.  In the lower leg the anterior tibial
artery occludes approximately 2 cm after its takeoff with
some distal reconstitution, but ultimately occluding again in
the mid leg.  The tibioperoneal trunk is patent.  However,
there is distal reconstitution of the peroneal artery.  The
posterior tibial artery is occluded at its origin.  Distally,
the posterior tibial artery Re constitutes the large
collateral branch from the peroneal artery and continues into
the foot.  The dorsalis pedis also reconstitutes at the level
of the ankle via collaterals from the peroneal.  Given these
findings, it was decided that the patient would require a fem
to ___ bypass.  We thus elected to terminate the procedure at
this time.  All wires and catheters were removed and the 4-
___ sheath was sutured into place to be removed at a later
time in the patient's room.  The patient tolerated the
procedure well.  There were no immediate complications
identified.  Dr. ___ was present for the entirety of the
procedure.

ANGIOGRAPHIC FINDINGS:
1. Patent infrarenal abdominal aorta without evidence of
    aneurysm or flow-limiting stenosis.
2. Patent bilateral iliac systems.
3. Patent left common femoral artery, profunda, and SFA.
4. Heavily calcified and diffusely diseased, but patent
    left popliteal artery.
5. The anterior tibial artery and posterior tibial artery
    are occluded proximally.  The peroneal artery is also
    occluded proximally, but reconstitutes distally in the
    leg and provides large collateral branches that
    reconstitute the posterior tibial artery and dorsalis
    pedis in the foot.

below-knee amputation.  He recently presented for wound 
complications on the right side at the amputation stump and
was treated with antibiotics, but was also noted to have ulcers 
of the left toes with erythema of the left lower extremity.  He 
underwent angiogram which showed patent bilateral iliac systems 
and a patent left common femoral
artery, profunda and SFA, as well as a totally calcified and 
diffusely diseased but patent left popliteal artery.  The 
anterior tibial and posterior tibial artery on the left side 
were occluded proximally and the peritoneal artery was also 
occluded proximally but reconstituted distally in the leg 
providing collateral branches that reconstituted the posterior 
tibial and dorsalis pedis in the foot.  Given these findings, we 
discussed the risks and benefits of the
procedure with the patient and decided to proceed with distal

Brief Hospital Course:
Patient was admitted the night before surgery for pre-operative 
clearance. Prior to surgery the cardiology and renal team were 
consulted and patient was cleared for surgery. Prior to surgery 
patient received hemodialysis. Patient underwent a Left below 
knee popliteal to posterior tibial artery bypass with saphenous 
graft. Patient tolerated the procedure well without 
complication. Immediately post operatively patient was in stable 
condition with pain well controlled. Patient was placed on 
standard bypass pathway. Patient continued to be followed by 
renal for dialysis and there recommendations for medications 
were followed. Cardiology highly recommended outpatient follow 
up with a cardiologist. Post operatively and for the remainder 
of the admission, the patient remained stable and lab work was 
WNL. Patient continued to receive his dialysis at his normal 
schedule. Patient worked with physical therapy who recommended 
that he go home with home services of physical therapy and 
nursing.
Patient continued to progress with his post operative course 
without complications. Patient was able to tolerate a normal 
diet. Patient was found to be stable for discharge.

OPERATIVE REPORT:
==================

Surgeon:  ___, ___

RESIDENT:  ___.

PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  Nonhealing ulcers to the left toes.

POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  Nonhealing ulcers to the left toes.

PROCEDURES:
1. Left below-knee popliteal to posterior tibial bypass
    with non-reverse saphenous vein graft.
2. Angioscopy vein inspection valve lysis.

INDICATIONS FOR PROCEDURE:  This is a ___ gentleman
with a history of diabetes, end-stage renal disease, on
dialysis and ischemic cardiomyopathy with an EF of 10% to
15%.  He has a longstanding history of peripheral vascular
disease.  He previously underwent a right-sided popliteal DP
bypass which subsequently failed and resulted in a right
below-knee amputation.  He recently presented for wound
complications on the right side at the amputation stump and
was treated with antibiotics, but was also noted to have
ulcers of the left toes with erythema of the left lower
extremity.  He underwent angiogram which showed patent
bilateral iliac systems and a patent left common femoral
artery, profunda and SFA, as well as a totally calcified and
diffusely diseased but patent left popliteal artery.  The
anterior tibial and posterior tibial artery on the left side
were occluded proximally and the peritoneal artery was also
occluded proximally but reconstituted distally in the leg
providing collateral branches that reconstituted the
posterior tibial and dorsalis pedis in the foot.  Given these
findings, we discussed the risks and benefits of the
procedure with the patient and decided to proceed with distal
bypass.

DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:  After informed consent was
obtained the patient was brought to the operating room, and a
check-in was held to confirm proper patient identification,
side and procedure. All members of the operating room team
agreed.  The patient was then positioned supine on the
operating table.  General anesthesia was induced.
Preoperative antibiotics were administered.  The left lower
extremity was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion
and after a time-out was held we made an incision just over
his posterior tibial artery at the level of the malleolus.
We dissected down and gained proximal and distal control of
this vessel and were pleased as it was rather soft and did
not appear to have a significant amount of calcification.  We
then turned our attention to our proximal target which would
be the below-knee popliteal.  We took a medial
infrageniculate approach and made an incision with the knee
flexed at 30 degrees.  Our incision was created about 1 cm
behind the posterior border of the tibia and took great care
not to injure the greater saphenous vein.  We incised the
crural fascia posterior to the tibia and extended this
proximally to the level of the semitendinosus tendon.  The
underlying medial head of the gastrocnemius muscle was
retracted posteriorly exposing the neurovascular bundle at
the proximal incision.  We readily identified the popliteal
vein as we entered the neurovascular sheath and we elevated
the artery above the vein into the incision and dissected
this out carefully.  We gained proximal and distal control of
this vessel using vessel loops.  We then began harvesting the
greater saphenous vein on the ipsilateral side.  We began
during this by creating an incision in the left groin.  We
readily identified the greater saphenous vein.  We then
followed this distally incising sharply with a knife along
its course and dissecting using a right angle.  Once we felt
that we had adequate length of vein we began dissecting this
out circumferentially from the surrounding soft tissues.  We
used a combination of clips and 0 silks to ligated its
branches and used a ___ Prolene figure-of-eight suture to
repair the vein in one position where we had evulsed the
branch.  Once were satisfied that we had adequate length we
ligated the vein proximally and distally and flushed this
with heparinized saline we then prepared to make our proximal
anastomosis using Potts scissors.  We tailored our vein and
created our anastomosis using parachute technique in a heel-
to-toe fashion.  This was uncomplicated and at this point, we
released our proximal vessel loop and flushed the graft.
There appeared to be good hemostasis though there was an area
leaking from the toe which we oversewed with Prolene suture.
Using railroad technique we then brought our graft distally
through our previously created tunnel.  In a similar fashion
we created our anastomosis using ___ running Prolene suture
in parachute technique and heel-to-toe fashion.  Once we were
satisfied with our anastomosis we released our vessel loops
and had an excellent graft pulse.  We confirmed this with the
Doppler as well.  We then gained hemostasis and then began
closing the proximal and distal target sites using Vicryl
suture.  We closed the skin incisions with staples.  Overall
the patient tolerated the procedure well.  There were no
complications at the end of the case.  The patient had an
excellent graft pulse at the end of the operation.

BACK TABLE ANGIOSCOPY:  After the saphenous vein was
harvested we then brought in to the back table for angioscopy
and valve lysis.  Using the angioscope we inspected the vein.
There did not appear to be any defects or significant
strictures.  The valves were adequately lysed without
perforation.  After this was completed the graft was brought
back into the field for anastomosis.

Dr. ___ was present throughout the operation in
compliance with CMS regulations.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,
You were admitted to ___ and 
underwent amputation of the ___ and ___ digits of the left foot. 
You have now recovered from surgery and are ready to be 
discharged. Please follow the instructions below to continue 
your recovery:

Weigh yourself every morning, call MD if weight goes up more 
than 3 lbs.

ACTIVITY: 
• On the side of your amputation you are non weight bearing for 
___ weeks. 
• You should keep this amputation site elevated when ever 
possible. 
• You may use the opposite foot for transfers and pivots.
• No driving until cleared by your Surgeon.
• No heavy lifting greater than 20 pounds for the next 3 weeks. 

BATHING/SHOWERING: 
• You may shower when you get home
• No tub baths or pools / do not soak your foot for 4 weeks from 
your date of surgery 

WOUND CARE:
• Sutures / Staples may have been removed before discharge. If 
they are not, an appointment will be made for you to return for 
staple removal. 
• When the sutures are removed the doctor may or may not place 
pieces of tape called steri-strips over the incision. These will 
stay on about a week and you may shower with them on. If these 
do not fall off after 10 days, you may peel them off with warm 
water and soap in the shower.

CAUTIONS:
• If you smoke, please make every attempt to quit.  Your primary 
care physician can help with this.  Smoking causes narrowing of 
your blood vessels which in turn decreases circulation.  
DIET:
• Low fat, low cholesterol / if you are diabetic – follow your 
dietary restrictions as before 
CALL THE OFFICE FOR: ___
• Bleeding, redness of, or drainage from your foot wound
• New pain, numbness or discoloration of the skin on the 
effected foot
• Fever greater than 101 degrees, chills, increased redness, or 
pus draining from the incision site.

IMAGING
=======
X Ray Right Hip ___
There is an impacted fracture of the subcapital right proximal 
femur 
with valgus angulation of the fracture apex. 

CXR ___. Linear opacities in bilateral lower lobes likely represent 
atelectasis. 
2. Prominent cardiac silhouette is likely exaggerated by low 
lung volumes. 
3. No pneumothorax or fracture. 

CT Head w/o Contrast ___. Study degraded by motion. 
2. No acute intracranial abnormality.  Please note MRI of the 
brain is more sensitive for the detection of acute infarct. 
3. Within limits of study, no definite evidence of acute 
intracranial 
hemorrhage or fracture. 
4. Left temporal probable chronic infarct.  Right cerebellar 
question 
additional chronic infarct versus arachnoid cyst. 
5.  Paranasal sinus disease and minimal nonspecific right 
mastoid fluid, as described. 

RUQUS ___. Distention of the IVC and hepatic veins, few periportal 
echoes with a small to moderate amount of perihepatic ascites, 
may relate to passive cardiac congestion. 
2. Although there are no Findings of cirrhosis, there is 
borderline distention of the Portal vein, and persistent 
splenomegaly which may be seen with Portal hypertension and/or 
altered hemodynamics. 
3. Cholelithiasis without acute cholecystitis.  There is new 
mild-to-moderate dilation of the common hepatic duct and 
pancreatic duct, could be secondary to choledocholithiasis in 
the acute setting, and suggest ERCP or MRCP for further 
evaluation, and to exclude a periampullary/pancreatic mass.

mild-to-moderate dilation of the common hepatic duct and 
pancreatic duct. Consider outpatient ERCP/MRCP to evaluate for 
periampullary/pancreatic mass - will need co-ordination with 
dialysis
[ ] Consider initiation of spironolactone as outpatient with

(ejection fraction ___, CAD s/p CABG, hx of ventricular 
tachycardia (ICD currently removed because of infection), hx 
CVA, peripheral artery disease, atrial fibrillation on apixaban, 
type 2 diabetes, ESRD on HD, recent ascites of unknown etiology

ACTIVE ISSUES
=============
# Ischemic cardiomyopathy
# Acute on chronic HFrEF EF 15%
Reports subacute worsening DOE and orthopnea with acute 
worsening in past 2 weeks. Led to patient sleeping in wheelchair 
and having a fall. Volume status primarily managed at HD but 
home furosemide 80mg was changed to torsemide 100mg on non-HD 
days. For afterload, continued lisinopril 5mg. Spironolactone 
should be considered as outpatient management with close 
monitoring of potassium. Patient was continued on metoprolol but 
dose was consolidated to succinate 50mg daily. Patient will 
require regular EP ___ for consideration of ICD 
replacement. First device was explanted due to line 
vegetation/endocarditis.

# Right femoral neck fracture
Seen by ortho service with plan to trial non-operative measures 
given medical co-morbidities, limited level of activity (s/p b/l 
BKAs) and fracture stability. Plan for ___ with ___ 
___ (___) for repeat right hip x-rays (or patient can 
have x rays performed at ___ and have them sent to Dr. ___
Activity: touchdown weightbearing on the right side

# Ascites
Small-to-moderate perihepatic ascites on ultrasound, likely 
cardiac in origin, consider fibroscan as outpatient to evaluate 
for liver disease. 

# Dilated biliary ducts
RUQUS with cholelithiasis without acute cholecystitis, new 
mild-to-moderate dilation of the common hepatic duct and 
pancreatic duct. Consider outpatient ERCP/MRCP to evaluate for 
periampullary/pancreatic mass while coordinating with dialysis.

# AFib, CHADsVASC 6
On apixaban for anticoagulation with history of left atrial 
appendage clot and cardioembolic stroke with L hemiplegia.
