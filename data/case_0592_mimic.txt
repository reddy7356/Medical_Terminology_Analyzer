K-4.3 Cl-108 HCO3-22 AnGap-___ year old female w/ no significant past medical hx presenting 
w/ palpitations and chest discomfort with diffuse concave ST 
elevations/PR depressions and negative troponins overall 
concerning for pericarditis. 

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
======================
[] Consider event monitor to further elucidate etiology of

colchicine therapy.

pantoprazole when patient is no longer taking NSAIDs.

ACUTE ISSUES:

# Presumed pericarditis
Patient presenting with 8 days of chest discomfort and 
palpitations with ECG showing diffuse ST segment elevations/PR 
depressions. Troponins negative. Friction rub appreciated on 
auscultation. Unclear etiology given lack of viral prodrome, 
other systemic symptoms to suggest malignancy. The differential 
would also include autoimmune etiologies, which can be further 
evaluated as an outpatient. Of note, she relays a history of 
"very severe conjunctivitis" in ___ that was evaluated 
by a doctor in ___, which could be consistent with 
episcleritis and point to a potential autoimmune etiology. She 
underwent TTE that showed normal biventricular function and did 
not show pericardial effusion. She was treated with colchicine 
and offered ibuprofen for symptomatic relief, though did not 
need it while hospitalized.
