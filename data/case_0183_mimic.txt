- Read per transfer summary:
- There is a heterogeneously enhancing mass 14mm in diameter in
the right cerebellar hemisphere with surrounding edema. 
- There are multiple ring-enhancing masses in the cerebrum with
surrounding edema. A total of a cerebral masses are identified
the largest one is in the left temporal lobe, 17 mm long axis
just inferior to the left basal ganglia. There is a 13 mm mass
near the body of the right side of the corpus callosum. 
- There is no midline shift or herniation. The brainstem is not
involved with a mass. 
- There is no intracranial hemorrhage.

___ Imaging FDG TUMOR IMAGING (PET- 
IMPRESSION:  Persistent lung nodules, with a several decreased 
in FDG avidity compared to the prior study.  However, there are 
at least two new lung nodules with FDG avidity. 

___ Cardiovascular ECHO 
The left atrium is normal in size. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thickness,
cavity size and regional/global systolic function are normal
(LVEF >55%). There is no ventricular septal defect. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels are
normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but
aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral
regurgitation. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure
is normal. There is no pericardial effusion.   

MRI Head ___
IMPRESSION: 1. Marked interval progression of intracranial 
metastatic disease compared with study of ___, with the 
vast majority of metastases demonstrating significant interval 
enlargement, the largest which now measures 18 mm. No definitely 
new lesions. 2. No evidence of superimposed acute infarction. No 
intracranial hemorrhage.

___ Neurophysiology EEG 
IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal continuous ICU EEG monitoring 
study due to: 
  
1) Frequent multifocal blunted epileptiform discharges, most 
often with foci in the left frontal, right frontal, and right 
posterior quadrant regions, consistent with multifocal cortical 
hyperexcitability; 
  
2) Generalized slowing present in the background, which is 
consistent with a moderate global encephalopathy, nonspecific 
with regards to etiology 

MICRO: 
___: Urine Cx - <10K CFU

 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ with HER+ breast cancer with known supra and infratentorial 
brain metastasis who was admitted to ___ with one 
week of progressive confusion and falls, found to have 
progressively larger brain mets. 

# Breast ca w/ brain/lung mets 
# Cerebral edema
# Falls
Had previously been receiving palliative chemo, WBRT and SBRT. 
Family meeting held on ___ and in consultation with neuro-onc, 
rad-onc, and med-onc, no further radiation indicated at this 
time and she will proceed with chemo. She received Carboplatin 
on D1 ___, D8 on ___ with plans for outpatient chemo 
administration on ___. She tolerated the chemotherapy well. 
Foley was placed for chemo precuations and discontinued on ___ 
and she passed her voiding trial.

# Word finding difficulties
# Encephalopathy 
Throughout hospitalization, apparent she has waxing/waning 
confusion, at times inability to follow commands and other times 
inability to find her words. Discussed w/ Dr ___ sx c/f 
seizure. Repeat MRI did not reveal CVA. UA  neg for infection. 
She denied any pain or localizing symptom. EEG was consistent w/
largely encephalopathy but cannot entirely rule out seizure so 
will continue zonisamide which was tolerated well.

# Hyperglycemia
# DM2
Has history of DM2, but unclear if she was taking diabetes 
medications at home. Quite hyperglycemic here and A1c is 11, 
suggesting this is not just due to steroids. She remained 
hyperglycemic requiring >100U insulin daily so consulted ___
and have been aggressively titrating her insulin as the dex 
continues to wear off. 

She was restarted on metformin and her insulin dose was 
titrated. Her discharge regimen was:

Glargine 10U Breakfast 15U Bedtime

# History of L femoral DVT: cont 2.5mg bid apixaban
 
# Chronic Diastolic Heart failure: Patient was euvolemic and 
normotensive despite holding her losartan and furosemide. Her 
home ASA was continued. On the day of discharge, the patient had 
mild, bibasilar crackles without dyspnea, increased work of 
breathing or hypoxia. Her home furosemide was reastarted.

# HTN: BP wnl off her home losartan, held bc of hyperkalemia 

#BILLING: >30  minutes were spent coordinating care with 
outpatient providers and preparing paperwork

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:

Patient's insulin was uptitrated, please follow up blood sugars 
and adjust as needed. Hyperglycemia may improve and require less 
insulin as effects from dexamethasone wear off

Losartan was held due to normotension. Please reassess blood 
pressure and volume status and restart if needed.

Patient restarted on home furosemide on day of discharge due to 
mild crackles on exam. Please monitor respiratory status.

Brief Hospital Course:
___ is a ___ with breast cancer with CNS mets who presents 
with increased seizures in the setting of UTI. 

She was placed on cvEEG monitoring and was noted to have many 
___ seizures) per hour. Clinically, these were noted to 
correlate with left face and left arm twitching. Her Keppra was 
increased to 1500mg BID and she was started on Vimpat 150mg BID. 
However, given the fact that her skilled nursing facility cannot 
give IV AEDs, she was ultimately switched to sublingual Ativan 
1.5mg every 6h. Her cvEEG showed reduction in electrographical 
seizures after initiation of Ativan. 

We spoke at length with the son about the balance between 
controlling her seizures and having her be more awake. 
Ultimately, the son favored better seizure control and more 
somnolence as he felt this was more in line with ___ 
wishes. 

Etiology of increased seizures was though to most likely be 
multifactorial in the setting of a UTI, recently discontinued 
zonisamide (unclear reasons) and interval progression of her 
known intracranial metastases. 

Her UTI was initially treated with ceftriaxone and then was 
switched to ampicillin when it grew enterococcus. Sensitivities 
returned and the enterococcus is ampicillin sensitive. She 
should continue Ampicillin for an additional 5 days. 

Palliative care was involved in her care during this 
hospitalization. The family would like to continue IV 
antibiotics and IV hydration until more distant family members 
can come see her. 

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
- please obtain concentrated liquid Ativan to use. She was using 
sublingual Ativan while admitted, but occasionally struggled 
with the sublingual tabs. 
- She will likely continue to have seizures after discharge. 
These can be treated with concentrated liquid Ativan 1mg as 
needed every 4 hours. This can be given in addition to her 
standing Ativan. Alternatively, her standing Ativan can be 
increased to 2mg every 6 hours. Again, the goal is not seizure 
freedom, but seizure reduction.
- In discussions with palliative care, the family has decided to 
continue IV antibiotics and IV hydration for the time being 
until other family members are able to come to ___ to see 
___.
- Please continue IV ampicillin for another 5 days for UTI 
treatment.
