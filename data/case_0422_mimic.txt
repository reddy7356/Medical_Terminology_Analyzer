Brief Hospital Course:
___ is a ___ man with past medicla history 
of high-grade CNS lymphoma, HIV presents with painful anal rash.

1. HSV Infection: Direct antigen from scrapings of base of 
ulcers returned as positive for HSV. No evidence of disseminated 
HSV infection. Pt reports he has had multiple infections with 
HSV in the past ___ years that have been treated with acyclovir. 
He was started on acyclovir with improvement in his symptoms and 
rash. He will complete a treatment course of acyclovir followed 
by continuing acyclovir at a prophylactic dose for continued 
suppression. 

2. Hyperlactatemia: Unknown etiology, did not respond to fluid 
resuscitation. Likely type 2 lactic acidosis due to NRTIs, less 
likely CNS lymphoma. Lack of evidence of hypoperfusion and 
sepsis argues against type I lactic acidosis. Per ___ 
attending, HAART unlikely to be culprit as pt has been 
stabilized on this regimen for awhile but unknown if lactate had 
ever been checked. Will have this followed up as an outpatient. 

3. Asymptomatic Bacteriuria: Urine culture grew e coli. Treated 
with three days of antibiotics.

dexamethasone; no evidence of meningitis. He will follow up with 
Dr. ___ continuing chemotherapy. 

5. Hyponatremia: He appears euvolemic. Serum osmolality low, 
urine sodium inappropriately high. This is most likely c/w 
SIADH. Most likely related to underlying intracranial disease.

6. Thrombocytopenia: It is possibly due to MTX. no other new 
medications. Stable but low. 

7. HIV: He is well controlled, CD 4 count 245, suppressed viral 
load. HAART re-started. 

8. CAD: s/p remote PCI with BMS, stable, cont ASA, BB, ACEi

Again identified is inhomogeneous susceptibility status post 
biopsy in the
region of the fourth ventricle on the right likely related to 
chronic blood
products with associated adjacent parenchymal T2/FLAIR 
hyperintensity and
minimal residual enhancement. There is no evidence of residual 
mass or new
areas of abnormal enhancement. A right frontal catheter tract is 
again noted.
 
There is no acute intracranial hemorrhage. Diffusion weighting 
imaging does
not demonstrate evidence of acute infarct. Ventricles and extra 
axial spaces
are within normal limits. The major intracranial vessels exhibit 
the expected
signal void related to vascular flow.
 
The paranasal sinuses demonstrate scattered areas of mucosal 
thickening. There
is fluid signal in scattered mastoid air cells bilaterally. The 
sella turcica,
craniocervical junction, and orbits are unremarkable.
 
IMPRESSION:
 
 
1. New relatively symmetric confluent areas of T2/FLAIR deep and
periventricular bihemispheric white matter signal abnormality 
without
associated enhancement or mass effect. Findings may be related 
to HIV
encephalopathy. Other differential considerations would include 
drug/treatment
related changes, toxic/metabolic etiologies, infectious 
etiologies (such as
PML, SSPE).
2. Grossly stable minimal residual enhancement adjacent to the 
fourth
ventricle on the right with mild adjacent T2/FLAIR 
hyperintensity consistent
with postsurgical changes without evidence of a new lesion or 
new areas of
abnormal enhancement.
 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ male with HIV, CAD, CNS lymphoma here for cycle 9 high dose 

methotrexate treatment. MRI after cycle 4 showed residual 
disease, so he continued on 2 week intervals until cycle 7, at 
which point MRI improved so switched to monthly cycles. After 
urinary alkalinization, he received methotrexate 17200mg 
(8g/m2).  
This was followed by leucovorin rescue 24 hours later. His 
methotrexate level on ___ is 0.07. He was discharged 
home in good condition. He has been asked to report back to ___ 
___ in 4 weeks for the next cycle (#10).
He had an MRI after this cycle which shows some changes possibly 
HIV encephalopathy but no evidence of lymphoma recurrence. 
For his HSV, he has been on acyclovir 800mg BID and will be 
monitored for symptoms. He continued his metoprolol and 
lisinopril at 12.5mg and 2.5mg respectively with good control of 
blood 
pressure. On previous admissions his blood pressures have run 
slightly low but he has continued these medications without 
problem. During this admission he had continued double vision, 
which he has had since diagnosis. It has improved since original 
diagnosis and is now stable. He will see his ophthalmologist 
next month.

Port placement ___
*** UNAPPROVED (PRELIMINARY) REPORT ***
INDICATION: ___ year old man with CNS lymphoma
 
COMPARISON: CHEST X-RAY ___HEST ___
 
TECHNIQUE: OPERATORS: Dr. ___ (interventional 
radiology fellow) and Dr. ___ (interventional radiology 
attending) performed the procedure. The attending was present 
and supervising throughout the procedure.
 
ANESTHESIA: Moderate sedation was provided by administrating 
divided doses of 150mcg of fentanyl and 3 mg of midazolam 
throughout the total intra-service time of 45 minutes during 
which the patient's hemodynamic parameters were continuously 
monitored by an independent trained radiology nurse. 1% 
lidocaine was injected in the skin and subcutaneous tissues 
overlying the access site.
 
CONTRAST: 0 ml of Optiray contrast.
 
FLUOROSCOPY TIME AND DOSE: 1.3 min, approximately 15 mGy
 
PROCEDURE 1. Right internal jugular approach chest double lumen 
Port-a-cath placement
 
PROCEDURE DETAILS: Following the explanation of the risks, 
benefits and
alternatives to the procedure, written informed consent was 
obtained from the patient. The patient was then brought to the 
angiography suite and placed supine on the exam table. A 
pre-procedure time-out was performed per ___ protocol. The 
upper chest and right neck were prepped and draped in the usual 
sterile fashion.
 
Under continuous ultrasound guidance, the patent right internal 
jugular vein was compressible and accessed using a micropuncture 
needle. Permanent
ultrasound images were obtained before and after intravenous 
access, which
confirmed vein patency. Subsequently a Nitinol wire was passed 
into the right atrium using fluoroscopic guidance. The needle 
was exchanged for a
micropuncture sheath. The Nitinol wire was removed and a short 
___ wire was advanced to make appropriate measurements for 
catheter length. The ___ wire was then passed distally into 
the IVC.
 
Next, attention was turned towards creation of a subcutaneous 
pocket over the upper anterior chest wall. After instilling 
superficial and deeper local anesthesia using lidocaine mixed 
with epinephrine, a 2.5 cm transverse incision was made and a 
subcutaneous pocket was created by using blunt dissection. The 
double lumen port was then connected to the catheter. The 
catheter was tunneled from the subcutaneous pocket towards the 
venotomy site from where it was brought out using a tunneling 
device. The port was then connected to the catheter and checks 
were made for any leakage by accessing both diaphragms using a 
non-coring ___ needle. No leaks were found.
 
The port was then placed in the subcutaneous pocket and secured 
with ___
Prolene sutures on either side. The venotomy tract was dilated 
using the
introducer of the peel-away sheath supplied. Following this, the 
peel-away
sheath was placed over the ___ wire through which the port was 
threaded into the right side of the heart with the tip in the 
right atrium. The sheath was then peeled away.
 
The subcutaneous pocket was closed in layers with ___ 
interrupted and ___
subcuticular continuous Vicryl sutures. Steri-strips and a 
single Vicryl
suture was used to close the venotomy incision site. 
Steri-Strips were also applied over the sutures. Final spot 
fluoroscopic image demonstrating good alignment of the catheter 
and no kinking. The tip is in the right atrium.
 
Both lumens of the port were accessed using a non coring ___ 
needle and
could be aspirated and flushed easily. Sterile dressings were 
applied. The
patient tolerated the procedure well without immediate 
complication. The port was left accessed as requested.
 
FINDINGS:
 
Patent right internal jugular vein. Final fluoroscopic image 
showing port with catheter tip terminating in the right atrium.
 
IMPRESSION:
 
Successful placement of a double lumen chest Port-a-cath via the 
right
internal jugular venous approach. The tip of the catheter 
terminates in the right atrium. The catheter is accessed and 
ready for use.

CARDIAC CATHETERIZATION 
ESTIMATED blood loss: 5 cc
Hemodynamics (see above):
Coronary angiography:  right dominant
LMCA: 
LAD:  80% proximal, chronic 100% mid with distal vessel filling
via collaterals
LCX:  30% OM with patent stent
RCA:  100% mid with left to right collaterals to distal RCA
Interventional details After discussion with Oncology, decided 
to proceed with stenting. Change for JR4 guide, drug coated 
stent of occluded RCA with 3.5 by 34 Resolute.  Change for XB3.5 
guide and drug coated stent of
proximal LAD with 2.75 by 12 Resolute with good results. 
Angiomax used. 

Assessment & Recommendations
 1. ASA 81 mg daily indefinitely and plavix 75 mg daily for one
year.

IMAGING 
ECHO ___
The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall 
thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There is mild regional 
left ventricular systolic dysfunction with hypokinesis of the 
basal inferior and distal septal segments (LAD and RCA disease). 
The remaining segments contract normally (LVEF = 45%). There is 
no ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size and 
free wall motion are normal. The diameters of aorta at the 
sinus, ascending and arch levels are normal. The aortic valve 
leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet 
excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation. The 
mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral 
regurgitation. There is no mitral valve prolapse. The pulmonary 
artery systolic pressure could not be determined. There is no 
pericardial effusion. 

IMPRESSION: Mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction, 
c/w multivessel CAD. 

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of ___, 
basal inferior hypokinesis is new. The other findings are 
similar.  

MRI Head ___
IMPRESSION:  
  
1. In comparison with the most recent examination, no 
significant changes are identified, relatively stable areas of 
high-signal intensity in the 
subcortical white matter and periventricular region detected on 
T2 and FLAIR sequences, probably related with HIV encephalopathy 
versus drug/treatment related changes. 
  
2. In the area of the fourth ventricle on the right, again 
postsurgical 
changes are re- demonstrated with minimal residual enhancement 
and 
susceptibility changes, likely consistent with residual blood 
products, no new lesions or new areas with abnormal enhancement 
are seen.) 

CT shoulder
IMPRESSION:  
  
1.  No definite shoulder mass identified. 
  
2.  Small focus of ___ opacities centrilobular 
nodularity in the right middle lobe, which could reflect a sign 
of early infection. Recommend clinical correlation. 
  
3. Mild degenerative changes at the right shoulder and 
acromioclavicular 
joints. 
  
4.  Air cysts in the lungs. This is nonspecific, but could be 
seen in the 
setting of Langerhans cell histiocytosis and 
lymphangiomyomatosis (unlikely in male patients), as well as 
other processes such as lymphocytic interstitial  pneumonia.

significant mass effect.  No acute large territorial infarction. 


___ ___
1.  Interval placement of an external ventricular drain 
terminating in the ___ ventricle via a right frontal approach.  
Associated mild decrease in ventricle size.    
2.  Status post right occipital craniotomy and biopsy of a 
fourth ventricle lesion. Expected post procedural changes 
including pneumocephalus.  No complications including large 
hemorrhage noted. 

___ ___
IMPRESSION:
1. Slight increase in size of the ventricles compared to the 
prior study. 
Unchanged appearance of external ventricular drain terminating 
in the ___
ventricle via a right frontal approach.   
2.  Increased pneumocephalus in the anterior horn of the right 
lateral
ventricle.   
3.  Unchanged appearance of small subarachnoid hemorrhage along 
the course of the drain.   
ATTENDING NOTE: There is little change in ventricular size.  

___ MR spine
IMPRESSION:
No evidence of metastatic disease within the spine.  
There is a T2 hyperintense enhancing left retroperitoneal lesion 
measuring 15 x 16mm that may represent a fatty lymphnode of 
unknown significance.  Enlarged thyroid gland with multiple 
masses. Recommend followup thyroid ultrasound for further 
evaluation.  Bilateral L5 spondylolysis with grade 1 
anterolisthesis of L5 on S1. 

___
TTE
Conclusions:
The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. Left 
ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There 
is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with 
focal hypokinesis of the distal septum and mild dyskinesis of 
the apex. The remaining segments contract normally (LVEF = 50 
%). The estimated cardiac index is normal (>=2.5L/min/m2). No 
masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. Transmitral 
and tissue Doppler imaging suggests normal diastolic function, 
and a normal left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg). 
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. 
The diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels 
are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally 
normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis or 
aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve appears structurally 
normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is no mitral 
valve prolapse. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not 
be determined. There is no pericardial effusion. 
IMPRESSION: Normal left ventricular cavity size with mild 
regional systolic dysfunction c/w CAD (distal LAD distribution). 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
___: Mr ___ is a ___ year old male who presented with 
dizziness, diplopia, gait instability, found to have 2cm right 
brainstem tumor and admitted to the Neurosurgical Service. Neuro 
onc / rad onc were consulted.  

___: CTA ___ with and without contrast was obtained and 
revealed no vascular abnormality.  An MRI of ___ revealed a 
right fourth ventricular mass.  Cardiology was consulted and 
determined patient is low risk for surgery, and recommended 
restarting ASA when able.  ID was consulted and recommneding 
contining current HIV regimen. 

___: CT abdomen/pelvis & CT chest and revealed no 
metastatic disease indicating tumor is likely a primary brain 
tumor. 

___: Meeting was held with Mr. ___, his family and an 
interpreter. The option for doing a brain biopsy here at ___ 
despite the patient being a non US resident with no insurance 
(and thus no benefits for post operative care) and the risks 
associated with surgery. Patient is scheduled to go to the OR 
tomorrow. Patient has elected to discuss his options with his 
family and let us know his final decision. 

___: The patient remained stable. His operative case was 
cancelled and rescheduled for tomorrow.

___: The patient went to the OR for a biopsy of his brain 
stem lesion.  A post operative scan showed an effaced fourth

placement of an external ventricular drain. He was extubated in 
the operating room and taken to the pacu for recovery. 

___:
The patient's urine culture came back positive for gram negative 
rods.  The patient remained on Vancomycin and Gentomycin. He had 
a repeat HCT which was stable and his EVD was raised to 25 above 
the tragus. The frozen pathology from the operating room showed 
high grade lymphoma and the patient was started on 
dexamethasone.  Cultures and cytology of his csf were sent off 
for analysis. 

On ___, the patient remained stable and his EVD output was 
minimal, his EVD was clamped at 1000 without issue. A CT ___ 
and CT spine were ordered for the next day.

MRI head ___
Final Report
STUDY:  MRI of the head with and without contrast.
 
CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___ man with history of CNS 
lymphoma, being
treated with high-dose of methotrexate with residual disease on 
last MRI,
followup examination.
 
COMPARISON:  Multiple prior MRI examinations, the most recent 
dated ___.
 
TECHNIQUE:  Pre-contrast axial and sagittal T1-weighted images 
were obtained,
axial FLAIR, axial T2, axial magnetic susceptibility and axial
diffusion-weighted images.  The T1-weighted sequences were 
repeated after the
administration of gadolinium contrast in axial T1, sagittal 
MP-RAGE and
multiplanar reconstructions were reviewed.
 
FINDINGS:  The patient is status post biopsy at the level of the 
fourth
ventricle on the right, again susceptibility artifacts are 
redemonstrated in
this region as well as mild high signal intensity on the 
corresponding axial
FLAIR (image #11, series #7), with no significant change since 
the prior
study, there is minimal residual enhancement in this area, 
apparently related
with post-surgical change with no evidence of residual mass or 
new areas with
abnormal enhancement.  There is no evidence of hydrocephalus or 
shifting of
the normally midline structures.  The supratentorial sulci and 
ventricles are
unremarkable with no evidence of diffusion abnormalities to 
indicate slow
diffusion.  Unchanged susceptibility artifact related with prior 
right frontal
external ventricular drain.  Major arterial vascular flow voids 
are present
and demonstrate normal distribution.  The orbits are 
unremarkable, the
paranasal sinuses again demonstrate a tiny mucus retention cyst 
on the left
maxillary sinus.
 
IMPRESSION:  Minimal residual enhancement adjacent to the fourth 
ventricle on
the right, with T2 and FLAIR hyperintensity, consistent with 
post-surgical
changes, stable since the prior examination, with no evidence of 
new lesions
or new areas of abnormal enhancement.  Long-term followup is 
advised to
demonstrate stability.

 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ male with HIV, CAD, CNS lymphoma here for cycle 7 high dose 

methotrexate treatment. MRI after cycle 4 showed residual 
disease, so plan was to increase dose to 8g/m2 and continue 
every 2 weeks until cycle 7, then reassess. After urinary 
alkalinization, he received methotrexate 16560mg (8g/m2) on ___ 
at 11pm.  
This was followed by leucovorin rescue 24 hours later. His 
methotrexate 
level on ___ is 0.12. He was continued on bicarbonate fluids 
and leucovorin for another 9 hours after that level and it is 
presumed his level is now less than 0.10. He will be discharged 
home in good condition. He had an MRI on this admission which 
showed post surgical changes and no evidence of residual 
disease. He will now be transitioned to monthly methotrexate 
cycles. He has been asked to report back to ___ on ___ 
for the next cycle (#8). 
For his HSV, he has been on acyclovir 800mg BID and will be 
monitored for symptoms. His blood pressure was slightly low 
while here but he continued his metoprolol and lisinopril at 
12.5mg and 2.5mg respectively with no symptoms of hypotension.

MRI head ___
FINDINGS:
 
There has been interval removal of a right frontal external 
ventricular drain
with some areas of blooming susceptibility along the tract 
likely related to
residual blood products. The patient is status post biopsy of a 
___
ventricular mass through a right suboccipital approach with 
associated mild T1
intrinsic hyperintensity and blooming susceptibility within the 
right aspect
of the ___ ventricle likely related to residual blood products. 
The
previously noted enhancing mass within the ___ ventricle is no 
longer
identified; there is some mild residual enhancement and adjacent 

parenchymal
high T2/FLAIR hyperintensity.
 
There is no evidence of acute intracranial infarct or 
hemorrhage. There are
nonspecific small scattered T2/FLAIR high signal foci throughout 

the brain.
Gray white matter differentiation is otherwise maintained. 
Ventricles and
extra axial spaces are also otherwise within normal limits for 
age. The major
intracranial vessels exhibit the expected signal void related to 

vascular
flow.
 
The paranasal sinuses demonstrate scattered areas of mucosal 
thickening.
Fluid signal and inflammatory changes are noted within scattered 

right greater
than left mastoid air cells. The sella turcica, craniocervical 
junction, and
orbits are unremarkable.
 
IMPRESSION:
 
Previously identified enhancing ___ ventricular mass is no 
longer present;
however, there is some mild residual enhancement and adjacent 
parenchymal high
T2/FLAIR hyperintensity abbout the right aspect of the ___ 
ventricle. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ male with HIV, CAD, CNS lymphoma here for cycle 5 high dose 

methotrexate treatment. MRI after cycle 4 showed residual 
disease, so after urinary alkalinization, he received increased 
dose 8g/m2 = 16320mg on ___. This was 
followed by leucovorin rescue 24 hours later. His methotrexate 
level on ___ is 0.05 and he will be discharged home in good 
condition. He will continue on biweekly 
methotrexate for 2 more cycles and has been asked to report back 
to ___ on 
___ for the next cycle (#6). after cycle 7 he will have another 
MRI to assess response.
For his HSV, he was switched to acyclovir 800mg BID and will be 
monitored for symptoms. His blood pressure was slightly low 
while here and his metoprolol and lisinopril were reduced by 
half to 12.5mg and 2.5mg respectively.

MRI brain ___
IMPRESSION:  Minimal residual enhancement adjacent to the fourth 
ventricle on
the right, with T2 and FLAIR hyperintensity, consistent with 
post-surgical
changes, stable since the prior examination, with no evidence of 
new lesions
or new areas of abnormal enhancement.  Long-term followup is 
advised to
demonstrate stability.

 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ male with HIV, CAD, CNS lymphoma here for cycle 8 high dose 

methotrexate treatment. MRI after cycle 4 showed residual 
disease, so he continued on 2 week intervals until cycle 7, at 
which point MRI improved so switched to monthly cycles. After 
urinary 
alkalinization, he received methotrexate 16640mg (8g/m2).  
This was followed by leucovorin rescue 24 hours later. His 
methotrexate level on ___ is 0.09. He was discharged 
home in good condition. He has been asked to report back to ___ 
___ in 5 weeks 
for the next cycle (#9). He wants to spend an extra week in ___ 
___ daughter's birthday. 
For his HSV, he has been on acyclovir 800mg BID and will be 
monitored for symptoms. He continued his metoprolol and 
lisinopril at 
12.5mg and 2.5mg respectively with good control of blood 
pressure. On previous admissions his blood pressures have run 
slightly low but he has continued these medications without 
problem. During this admission he had continued double vision, 
which he has had since diagnosis. Overall he thinks it is much 
better, but maybe a little worse in the last month, though he is 
not sure. He will follow up with his eye doctor this week.

FINDINGS:
 
There has been interval removal of a right frontal external 
ventricular drain
with some areas of blooming susceptibility along the tract 
likely related to
residual blood products. The patient is status post biopsy of a 
___
ventricular mass through a right suboccipital approach with 
associated mild T1
intrinsic hyperintensity and blooming susceptibility within the 
right aspect
of the ___ ventricle likely related to residual blood products. 
The
previously noted enhancing mass within the ___ ventricle is no 
longer
identified; there is some mild residual enhancement and adjacent 


parenchymal
high T2/FLAIR hyperintensity.
 
There is no evidence of acute intracranial infarct or 
hemorrhage. There are
nonspecific small scattered T2/FLAIR high signal foci throughout 


the brain.
Gray white matter differentiation is otherwise maintained. 
Ventricles and
extra axial spaces are also otherwise within normal limits for 
age. The major
intracranial vessels exhibit the expected signal void related to 


vascular
flow.
 
The paranasal sinuses demonstrate scattered areas of mucosal 
thickening.
Fluid signal and inflammatory changes are noted within scattered 


right greater
than left mastoid air cells. The sella turcica, craniocervical 
junction, and
orbits are unremarkable.
 
IMPRESSION:
 
Previously identified enhancing ___ ventricular mass is no 
longer present;
however, there is some mild residual enhancement and adjacent 
parenchymal high
T2/FLAIR hyperintensity abbout the right aspect of the ___ 
ventricle. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ male with HIV, CAD, CNS lymphoma here for cycle 6 high dose 
methotrexate treatment. MRI after cycle 4 showed residual 
disease, so plan was to increase dose to 8g/m2 and continue 
every 2 weeks until cycle 7, then reassess. After urinary 
alkalinization, he received 16560mg methotrexate on ___.  
This was 
followed by leucovorin rescue 24 hours later. His methotrexate 
level on ___ is 0.09 and he will be discharged home in good 
condition. He will continue on biweekly methotrexate for 1 more 
cycle and has been asked to report back to ___ on ___ for 
the next cycle (#7). after cycle 7 he will have another MRI to 
assess response.
For his HSV, he has been on acyclovir 800mg BID and will be 
monitored for symptoms. His blood pressure was slightly low 
while here but he continued his metoprolol and lisinopril at 
12.5mg and 2.5mg respectively with no symptoms of hypotension.

FINDINGS:
 
There has been interval removal of a right frontal external 
ventricular drain
with some areas of blooming susceptibility along the tract 
likely related to
residual blood products. The patient is status post biopsy of a 
___
ventricular mass through a right suboccipital approach with 
associated mild T1
intrinsic hyperintensity and blooming susceptibility within the 
right aspect
of the ___ ventricle likely related to residual blood products. 
The
previously noted enhancing mass within the ___ ventricle is no 
longer
identified; there is some mild residual enhancement and adjacent 
parenchymal
high T2/FLAIR hyperintensity.
 
There is no evidence of acute intracranial infarct or 
hemorrhage. There are
nonspecific small scattered T2/FLAIR high signal foci throughout 
the brain.
Gray white matter differentiation is otherwise maintained. 
Ventricles and
extra axial spaces are also otherwise within normal limits for 
age. The major
intracranial vessels exhibit the expected signal void related to 
vascular
flow.
 
The paranasal sinuses demonstrate scattered areas of mucosal 
thickening.
Fluid signal and inflammatory changes are noted within scattered 
right greater
than left mastoid air cells. The sella turcica, craniocervical 
junction, and
orbits are unremarkable.
 
IMPRESSION:
 
Previously identified enhancing ___ ventricular mass is no 
longer present;
however, there is some mild residual enhancement and adjacent 
parenchymal high
T2/FLAIR hyperintensity abbout the right aspect of the ___ 
ventricle.

Brief Hospital Course:
PRINCIPLE REASON FOR ADMISSION:
___ is a ___ year old man with HIV on HAART and CNS 
lymphoma on maintenance HD-MTX who is admitted for planned 
chemotherapy.

# CNS lymphoma: Most recent imaging shows no evidence of
recurrence. Per patient request has been placed on q12 month
schedule, although this cycle was delayed due to scheduling and
concurrent medical issues. Urine was alkalinzed with IV and po 
sodium bicarbonate per protocol. He tolerated infusion of 8g/m2 
on ___ with some
mild pruritis, which has been pretty consistent per patients
prior episodes. Leucovorin rescue per protocol and monitored MTX 
level q24 hours until <0.1. Tolerated treatment well without 
signficant side effects aside from mild transaminitis which 
persisted on discharge. He should have this monitored to ensure 
normalization of his LFT's. He will follow up in 12 months for 
his next HD-MTX with clinic visit with Dr. ___ and 
repeat MRI.

# POC: Medial lumen of POC malfuncitoning. Needs stripping. 
Emailed IV access team to alert them for outpatient management.

# Dysuria: Developed single episode of dysuria day prior to 
discharge. UA did have white cells and bacteria. We empirically 
treated with cipro 500 bid x10 days (through ___. Urine 
culture with <10K CFU. He should follow up with his primary care 
doctor to ensure resolution of his dysuria/pyuria.

# Folliculitis: Scattered simple folliculitis on admission exam. 
Could consider mollascum given HIV status, but  lesions appear 
to be more c/w simple folliculitis. No signs of systemic 
infection or even surrounding cellulitis or deeper skin 
infection. Stable.

# HIV: Well controlled, followed at ___. Continued home 
Stribild.

# Kaposi's sarcoma - Single isolated lesion, now resolved prior 
to admission. No evidence of visceral involvement.

# CAD: Takes single agent ASA at home. We held ASA in the 
setting of MTX and substituted plavix instead. We resumed ASA on 
discharge. We also held his statin. We continued metoprolol. 

# HTN: Continued home metoprolol and lisinopril 

# Thyroid nodules: Followed as outpatient. Cytology negative; 
final path pending. Plan for outpatient follow up as previously 
planned

# GERD
# Hx of gastric ulcer: Held home pantoprazole in setting of MTX. 
Substituted ranitidine

# Billing: >30 minutes spent coordinating and executing this 
discharge plan
