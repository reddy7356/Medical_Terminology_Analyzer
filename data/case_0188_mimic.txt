ECHO:

Conclusions  

Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal. 
There is moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction 
with near-akinesis of the mid- and distal segments of the 
anterior wall and septum. True LV apex is incompletely 
visualized, but also appears hypo-/akinetic. The remaining 
segments contract normally (LVEF = 35%). Right ventricular 
chamber size is normal. with focal hypokinesis of the apical 
free wall. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened 
but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is 
seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is 
no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is 
seen. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is 
normal. There is no pericardial effusion. 

IMPRESSION: Moderate regional biventricular systolic 
dysfunction, c/w LAD-territory infarction. Mild mitral 
regurgitation.

STRESS:

INTERPRETATION: This ___ year old woman with a PMH of PVD and MI 
___ 
was referred to the lab prior to peripherial vascular surgery. 
The 
patient was infused with 0.142 mg/kg/min of dipyridamole over 4 
minutes. 
No arm, neck, back or chest discomfort was reported by the 
patient 
throughout the study. There were no significant ST segment 
changes 
during the infusion or in recovery. The rhythm was sinus with 1 
isolated apb and vpb. Appropriate hemodynamic response to the 
infusion 
or in recovery. The dipyridamole was reversed with 125 mg of 
aminophylline IV. 

IMPRESSION: No anginal type symptoms or ischemic EKG changes to 
pharmacologic stress. Nuclear report sent separately. 

PMIBI:

INTERPRETATION:  
  
The image quality is adequate but limited due to soft tissue and 
motion. There is left arm attenuation in both sets of images, 
but the arm is across the inferior aspect of the heart inthe 
stress images. 
  
Left ventricular cavity size is normal. 
  
Rest and stress perfusion images reveal uniform tracer uptake 
throughout the left ventricular myocardium.  
  
Gated images reveal normal wall motion.  
  
The calculated left ventricular ejection fraction is 72% with an 
EDV of 51 ml.  
  
IMPRESSION: 
  
1. Normal myocardial perfusion. 
  
2. Normal left ventricular cavity size and systolic function. 

HAND FILMS:

1. Concern for a nondisplaced scaphoid waist fracture. 
  
2. Generalized demineralization. 
  
3. Chondrocalcinosis. 

 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the plastic surgery service on ___ 
and had a multiple procedures, two angiograms and a Extensive 
left iliofemoral endarterectomy profundoplasty with saphenous 
veinangioplasty.

The patient tolerated the procedure well. 

Neuro: Post-operatively, the patient received Narcotics with 
good effect and adequate pain control. When tolerating oral 
intake, the patient was transitioned to oral pain medications. 

CV: Post op pt had flash pulmonary edema which resulted in a 
NSTEMI. Pt was diuresed. Had a PMIBI and Stress. See pertinant 
results. Pt was refusing cardiac cath. CHF EF >55%. Diastolic 
acute on chronic CHF exaserbation

Pulmonary: See above

GI: Post-operatively, the patient was given IV fluids until 
tolerating oral intake. Her diet was advanced when appropriate, 
which was tolerated well. He/She was also started on a bowel 
regimen to encourage bowel movement.

GU: Foley was removed on POD#3. Intake and output were closely 
monitored. pt was also found to have UTI. Completed course of 
cefazolin. Pt on admission ws found to have ARF. Secondary to 
dehydration. Creatinine was 3.5 on DC 1.2. 

ID: The patient was started on IV cefazolin for UTI, switched to 
PO. Finished full course. The patient's temperature was closely 
watched for signs of infection. 

Prophylaxis: The patient received subcutaneous heparin during 
this stay, and was encouraged to get up and ambulate as early as 
possible. 

At the time of discharge on POD 16, the patient was doing well, 
afebrile with stable vital signs, tolerating a regular diet, 
ambulating, voiding without assistance, and pain was well 
controlled.
