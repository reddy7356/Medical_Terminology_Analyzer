Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ is an ___ male who presented to ___ s/p fall 
down approximately 10 steps at home. The patient was amnestic to 
the entire event and he was found unconscious on the ground by 
EMS. Normal vitals and normal fingerstick on first assessment. 
The patient complained about pain in the left shoulder but no 
other obvious signs of trauma.  Imaging revealed a left 
acromioclavicular joint separation.  Orthopedic Surgery was 
consulted and recommended non-operative management.  They 
recommended a sling for comfort, out of sling 3 times daily for 
pendulums and elbow/wrist range of motion, and follow-up in 
orthopedic trauma clinic in 2 weeks.  

In the ED, the patient was originally hemodynamically stable. He 
was pan scanned with findings concerning for a left gluteal 
hematoma and possible active extravasation on the left gluteal. 
He was seen by ___ who felt that his injury is superficial and 
not amenable to any procedures at this time. During his time in 
the ED, the patient attempted to stand up out of bed and had an 
episode where he became pale, diaphoretic and his eyes rolled 
back. He had a syncopal event. Given the concern for possible 
active extravasation and syncopal event, the patient received 2 
units of pRBCs. He was transferred to the TSICU for close HD 
monitoring and serial Hct exams. 

Syncopal workup was initiated and the patient had a negative 
ECHO and EKG was negative for AV block.  Carotid US showed 
60-69% stenosis of the right internal carotid artery and less 
than 40% stenosis of the left internal carotid artery. The 
Medical service recommended that the patient be discharged with 
a 48 hour Holter monitor for his PCP to monitor for any cardiac 
events.

The patient worked with occupational therapy. Pain was managed 
with acetaminophen.  The patient ambulated independently. At the 
time of discharge, the patient was doing well, afebrile and 
hemodynamically stable.  The patient was tolerating a diet, 
ambulating, voiding without assistance, and pain was well 
controlled.  The patient received discharge teaching and 
follow-up instructions with understanding verbalized and 
agreement with the discharge plan.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,

You were admitted to the hospital after a fall at home with loss 
of consciousness.  It is thought that this fall may be due to 
syncope (a temporary loss of consciousness usually related to 
insufficient blood flow to the brain).  In the emergency 
department, you had imaging which showed a left buttock hematoma 
(blood collection within the soft tissues), with slow, 
persistent bleeding.  Your imaging also showed a left 
acromioclavicular joint separation (separation of the collar 
bone from the shoulder blade).  

For your buttock hematoma, the Interventional Radiology team was 
consulted and no surgical intervention was needed.  You became 
dizzy in the emergency room and you received blood products.  
The bleeding from the hematoma stopped and your blood levels 
remained stable.

The Orthopedic surgery service evaluated your left 
acromioclavicular joint separation and no surgery was needed.  
They recommend that you wear a sling for comfort and perform 
passive range of motion exercises for the shoulder and wrist. 

To determine why you may have felt dizzy in the emergency room 
and why you may have lost consciousness at home, a cardiac 
workup was performed which did not reveal anything abnormal.  
The medicine team recommended that you wear a Holter monitor at 
home for 2 (two) days to monitor your heart, and the results 
will be reviewed by your primary care provider.

You have worked with Occupational therapy and you are cleared to 
be discharged home.

Please note the following discharge instructions:

Please call your doctor or nurse practitioner or return to the 
Emergency Department for any of the following:

*You experience new chest pain, pressure, squeezing or 
tightness.
*New or worsening cough, shortness of breath, or wheeze.
*If you are vomiting and cannot keep down fluids or your 
medications.
*You are getting dehydrated due to continued vomiting, diarrhea, 
or other reasons. Signs of dehydration include dry mouth, rapid 
heartbeat, or feeling dizzy or faint when standing.
*You see blood or dark/black material when you vomit or have a 
bowel movement.
*You experience burning when you urinate, have blood in your 
urine, or experience a discharge.
*Your pain in not improving within ___ hours or is not gone 
within 24 hours. Call or return immediately if your pain is 
getting worse or changes location or moving to your chest or 
back.
*You have shaking chills, or fever greater than 101.5 degrees 
Fahrenheit or 38 degrees Celsius.
*Any change in your symptoms, or any new symptoms that concern 
you.

Please resume all regular home medications, unless specifically 
advised not to take a particular medication. Also, please take 
any new medications as prescribed.

Please get plenty of rest, continue to ambulate several times 
per day, and drink adequate amounts of fluids. Avoid lifting 
weights greater than ___ lbs until you follow-up with your 
surgeon.
Avoid driving or operating heavy machinery while taking pain 
medications.

-Please wear a sling to your left arm for comfort
-Please remove sling 3 times daily for pendulums and elbow/wrist 
range
of motion
