effusion. Post-bypass: The patient is not receiving inotropic 
support post-CPB. There is a well-seated prosthetic valve with 
good leaflet excursion in the aortic position. There is no 
paravalvular or transprosthetic regurgitation. There is a 
minimal transprosthetic gradient of 4 mm Hg. Biventricular 
systolic function is consistent with pre-bypass findings. All 
other findings consistent with pre-bypass findings. The aortic 
graft seems well and other thoracic aorta is intact. All

EKG ___ heart block with a ventricular rate of 30 
beats per minute and an atrial rate of approximately 80 beats 
per minute. QRS duration is prolonged with a right bundle-branch 
block pattern. There are extremely deep T wave inversions in the 
right precordial leads. Compared to the previous tracing of 
___ the complete heart block is new and the striking T wave 
inversions in leads V1-V3 are new. These T wave changes may be 
secondary to the intraventricular conduction delay but are much 
greater depth than ordinarily seen. Consider acute myocardial 
ischemia.  
.
CXR (___): FINDINGS: In comparison with study of ___, a 
dual-channel pacemaker has been implanted with leads extending 
into the region of the right atrium and apex of the right 
ventricle. No evidence of pneumothorax or vascular congestion. 
Some atelectatic changes are seen at the left base. On the 
lateral view, there is some opacification posteriorly. This 
could represent a combination of crowding of vessels and 
atelectasis. However, in the appropriate clinical setting, 
possibility of pneumonia would have to be considered. 
.
 
Brief Hospital Course:
Patient is a ___ h/o HIV, CAD s/p CABG, bicuspid aortic valve 
s/p bioprosthetic AVR, HIV (CD4 510, VL undetectable), and 
Grave's disease who presents with episodes of lightheadedness 
and shaking, found to be in complete heart block in ED; now s/p 
pacemaker placement.
.  
#. Complete Heart Block: Patient found to be in CHB in ED, 
subsequently had episode of asystole for time period of 13 
seconds. Rhythm returned spontaneously in ED prior to atropine 
administration. EP was consulted for PPM. Most likely 
explanation for patient's CHB is fibrosis of the conduction 
system (50% of cases). Also on ddx was thyroid dysfunction given 
the patient's history of ___, though TSH returned normal. 
Also considered Lyme, given patient's recent camping and outdoor 
activity, serology was negative. The patient's propanolol was 
discontinued prior to the procedure. The patient underwent 
successful implantation of a pacemaker. He was discharged home 
on a course of Keflex.
.  
#. CAD: No evidence of active ischemia, given patient's absence 
of chest pain, trop <0.01. Continued on ASA 81 mg.  
.  
# Thyroid: Studies from ___ within normal limits, now TSH 2.1. 
Stable. Continued levothyroxine.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the General Surgical Service for 
evaluation and treatment of acute on chronic cholecystitis.  On 
___ the patient underwent laparoscopic converted to open 
cholecystectomy.  This went well without complications (reader 
referred to the Operative Note for details). After a brief, 
uneventful stay in the PACU, the patient arrived on the floor 
NPO, on IV fluids and antibiotics, with a foley catheter, and IV 
pain medications for pain control.  The patient was 
hemodynamically stable.

Neuro: The patient received IV pain medications with good effect 
and adequate pain control.  When tolerating oral intake, the 
patient was transitioned to oral pain medications with good 
result.

CV: The patient remained stable from a cardiovascular 
standpoint; vital signs were routinely monitored.

Pulmonary: The patient remained stable from a pulmonary 
standpoint; vital signs were routinely monitored. Good pulmonary 
toilet, early ambulation and incentive spirometry were 
encouraged throughout hospitalization.

GI/GU/FEN: Post-operatively, the patient was made NPO with IV 
fluids. Diet was advanced when appropriate, which was well 
tolerated.  Patient's intake and output were closely monitored, 
and IV fluid was adjusted when necessary.  Electrolytes were 
routinely followed, and repleted when necessary.  The patient 
had several bouts of watery stool incontinence.  Samples were 
sent for c. diff, which were negative.  His diarrhea 
subsequently improved, and there were no further episodes of 
incontinence.

ID: The patient's white blood count and fever curves were 
closely watched for signs of infection.  Pt complained of loose 
stools, but as mentioned, the C. diff was negative.  He was kept 
on his antiretroviral medications throughout his 
hospitalization.

Heme: JP drain output was noted to be significant in the 24-hour 
period post-operatively and bloody in quality. Pt remained 
hemodynamically stable throughout. Hct dropped from 34 to 26, 
and he received two units of pRBCs with an appropriate 
hematocrit response and no further transfusion requirements.  
His Hct slowly trended back upwards, and the JP output decreased 
and became serosanguinous in nature.  On the day of discharge, 
the JP drain was removed.

Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin was held during his stay due 
to the concern for bleeding.  Venodyne boots were used during 
this stay; he was also encouraged to get up and ambulate as 
early as possible.

At the time of discharge, the patient was doing well, afebrile 
with stable vital signs and stable hematocrit.  The patient was 
tolerating a regular diet, ambulating, voiding without 
assistance, and pain was well controlled.  The patient received 
discharge teaching and follow-up instructions with verbalized 
understanding and agreement with the discharge plan.
