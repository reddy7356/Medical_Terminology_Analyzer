borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no 
pericardial effusion. 

IMPRESSION: Mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction, 
c/w CAD. No significant valvular disease seen.
 
Brief Hospital Course:
ASSESSMENT & PLAN:  
___ yo M with PMHx sig. for CAD, bipolar/depression who presents 
with fall, resulting in head laceration, R ___ digit fracture, 
experienced a hypotensive episode in the ED, now with elevated 
troponins.  
.  
# Hypotensive episode:  This occurred in the ED and has not 
recurred.  It may have been a vasovagal episode from pain, as 
patient's head laceration was just sutured and his finger was 
being splinted.  He may have been slightly dehydrated as well 
since he had 2 episodes of diarrhea the day prior to admission 
(which has since resolved) and his blood pressures responded to 
1L of NS.  He was not found to be orthostatic on floor.  No 
cardiogenic causes were found as he was ruled out for MI, had no 
events on telemetry, and ECHO showed an EF of 50%.  
.  
# Delirium:  In the ED, pt was found to have acute mental status 
changes.  It was unclear if it was related to the hypotensive 
event.  He does have a remote history of seziure disorder as 
well, which he describes as "loss of awareness."  This did not 
recur during his hospitalization.
.  
# Demand ischemia:  After his hypotensive episodes, he had an 
EKG with noted STD in V3-6, which resolved on subsequent EKGs.  
His first set of cardiac enzymes were negative, and his second 
set had a troponin T at 0.16, which was the peak.  Cardiology 
was consulted and felt that the patient had demand ischemia in 
setting of hypotensive episodes.  At no time did the patient 
have chest pain.  ECHO showed mild regional left ventricular 
systolic dysfunction with basal inferior akinesis. Cardiology 
recommended medical management, and patient was started on 
Metoprolol and Atorvastatin. He should establish Cardiology 
outpatient follow-up.  
.  
# Fall:  Patient reported that he had tripped over the curb.  He 
denies any prodromal symptoms, and it was not like his previous 
seziures.  On the floor, he was not orthostatic.  He 
demonstrated that he could ambulate without assist.  Home ___ 
will be arranged for him.  His head laceration was sutured, and 
they can be removed in ___ days.  His right fourth finger was 
found to be fractured, and this was splinted by Plastic Surgery. 
 He will need follow up in Hand Clinic on ___.
.
# Depression:  Pt appears depressed with flat affect, denies any 
worsening depression, suicidal ideation.  He was continued on 
cymbalta, zyprexa.
.
# Vertebral compression fractures:  This was seen on his CT 
scan.  He was started on calcium and vitamin D supplements.  He 
will likely need DEXA scan v. initiation of bisphosphonates as 
an outpatient.

mood disorders (bipolar and depression with suicidal ideation, 
treated with ECT), seizures (which, per patient, he has not 
experienced for ___ years but were treated successfully with 
phenytoin in the distant past), and several falls with subacute 
fractures over the past year who presents following an episode 
of tonic-clonic jerking and urinary continence at a grocery 
store.
.
The patient was reportedly in his usual state of health on the 
morning of admission at the grocery store when he had an 
observed episode of tonic-clonic jerking. The episode 
purportedly lasted "less than a few minutes" per his nurse. He 
fell backwards but was caught by a bystander, who let him down 
on the floor without causing trauma to the head or body. There 
was urinary incontinence during the episode, but no other 
reportable symptoms besides tonic-clonic jerking in the upper 
extremities and possibly lower extremities bilaterally. 
Following the episode, the patient was reportedly somewhat 
confused and sleepy until he arrived at the emergency 
department. 
.
In the field, the patient was found to be normoglycemic. He was 
brought to the emergency room, where he verbally recounted the 
story of the episode. He also told the emergency team that he 
was depressed and planned to kill himself. Approximately one 
hour after arriving in the ED (now 14:50), he began to stutter 
("I need, I need, I need") for approximately 30 seconds before 
he became mute other than uttering "mmm" occasionally to answer 
questions. At this point he only followed the simplest of 
commands. 30 minutes later, he began to babble incoherently in 
response to questioning, still following only simple commands.   

.
Prior to the onset of the mutism, the patient did not report any 
headache, chest pain, shortness of breath, nausea, vomiting, or 
diarrhea. There were no fevers, chills, or sweats. He did 
mention on arrival to the ED that he had had a several week 
history of dull abdominal pain. 
.
Of note, the patient has a history of several falls and 
resultant subacute fractures and lacerations over the past year, 
and was last admitted to the ___ in ___ for a fall that 
resulted from "tripping over a curb." There has been no evidence 
of intracranial bleeds in any of these episodes, he was never 
orthostatic, and the histories were not consistent with 
vasovagal episodes. Per the respective discharge summaries, 
there never was reported any prodromal symptoms during these 
episodes.   
.
Also of note, per OMR the patient has declared himself a 
Jehovah's Witness and described himself as not willing to 
receive blood products under any circumstance. 
.
The patient was not able to respond to a neurological review of 
systems. He did mention that he has a seizure disorder that has 
not been active for ___ years, and per OMR it was treated many 
years ago with phenytoin only.

====================
Chest x-ray (PA and lateral) Study Date ___ 3:35 ___
FINDINGS: Frontal and lateral views of the chest are obtained. 
The patient 
is status post median sternotomy and CABG. The cardiac and 
mediastinal 
silhouettes are stable with the aorta calcified and tortuous and 
the cardiac silhouette not enlarged. The previously seen right 
base rounded density, which was thought to possibly represent 
nipple shadow, is not appreciated on the current study. No focal 
consolidation, pleural effusion, or evidence of pneumothorax is 
seen. There may be mild right base atelectasis, with lateral 
curvilinear opacity similar in appearance to ___. 
Compression of an upper lumbar vertebral body is subtly seen, 
unchanged. 
IMPRESSION: No significant interval change, no acute 
cardiopulmonary process. 
====================
Head CT without contrast Study Date ___ 3:08 ___
FINDINGS: There is no evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage, 
edema, shift of normally midline structures or large acute major 
vascular territory infarction. Extensive periventricular and 
subcortical white matter low attenuation likely reflects 
sequelae of chronic small vessel ischemic disease. Focal 
hypodensities in bilateral basal ganglia likely reflects chronic 
lacunar infarcts. The ventricles, sulci and extra-axial CSF 
spaces are prominent, which likely reflect age-related 
involutional changes. Visualized osseous structures and 
paranasal sinuses appear unremarkable. Unchanged radiopaque 
foreign body in the right orbit is noted.  
IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial process. 
=====================
Transthoracic echocardiogram Study Date ___ 11:38:52 AM  
The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall 
thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There is mild regional 
left ventricular systolic dysfunction with akinesis of the basal 
inferior wall and hypokinesis of basal inferolateral wall. Right 
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The 
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic 
stenosis is not present. No masses or vegetations are seen on 
the aortic valve, but cannot be fully excluded due to suboptimal 
image quality. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve 
leaflets are mildly thickened. No masses or vegetations are seen 
on the mitral valve, but cannot be fully excluded due to 
suboptimal image quality. Mild to moderate (___) mitral 
regurgitation is seen. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure 
could not be determined. There is no pericardial effusion. 
.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of ___, 
the severity of mitral regurgitation has increased. No 
vegetation identified. If clinically suggested, the absence of a 
vegetation by 2D echocardiography does not exclude endocarditis.
======================
EEG pending.
 
Brief Hospital Course:
This patient is a ___ year-old man with a distant history of a 
seizure disorder controlled with phenytoin, hypertension, breast 
cancer, and several falls and subacute fractures over the past 
year who presented with an episode of tonic-clonic jerking and 
urinary incontinence with a postictal period of confusion and 
eventual expressive aphasia. 
.
Neurological and mental status examinations were notable for a 
expressive aphasia, normal strength and reflexes, ability to 
follow only single-step commands, inability to repeat the 
examiner's words, down-going Babinskis bilaterally, and thought 
content that involved suicidal ideation prior to onset of the 
aphasia.
.
*) Generalized tonic-clonic seizure with urinary incontinence:
The patient's seizure in the setting of a period of ___ years 
without any seizures was concerning for an infectious or 
malignant underlying etiology. Head CT in the ED showed no acute 
process but marked frontal atrophy, per above, and the patient 
was loaded with phenytoin. In the setting of renal failure no 
contrast was used in this CT. Head MRI was considered, but 
full-body x-ray confirmed the presence of metal in his body. On 
the first evening of the hospital stay, the patient became 
febrile to 101.0. CSF and urine cultures were negative, and 
blood cultures grew out coagulase negative Staph. species, 
likely a contaminant (present in 1 of 2 samples). The fever 
resolved after one acetaminophen dose and did not return 
throughout his hospital stay. It was ultimately thought that 
this seizure was a reoccurance of the patient's seizure disorder 
that he had experienced several years prior, as infectious 
workup was negative and there was low concern for an 
intracranial mass.  Patient remained seizure free on the 
dilantin throughout his hospital course.  Prelim read of EEG 
demonstrated some background slowing but no focality or 
epileptic activity.  A final read will be available in ___ days. 
 He will need to have dilantin level checked in about 10 days, 
with LFTs, CBC, and Lytes.
.
.
*) Low-grade fever:
The Tmax was 101.0, and the fever resolved after one dose of 
acetaminophen and did not return throughout the hospital stay. 
Urine and CSF showed no signs of infection. The patient's blood 
culture initially came back positive for GPCs in clusters, 
raising concern for Staph aureus bacteremia and possible 
endocarditis. IV vancomycin was begun. TTE was performed, which 
was unconcerning for vegetations. However, speciation showed the 
organism to be coagulase negative, highly suggestive of 
contamination (only 1 or 2 vials drawn). The fever may have been 
due to an erroneous measurement, a drug fever, or a viral or 
other infection that was self-limited.  If patient should 
develop any fever or illness while at the ___ he should 
return for further evaluation.   
.
*) Abdominal pain:
The patient complained of dull abdominal pain in the left lower 
quadrant occasionally during his hospital stay. Constipation and 
diverticulitis/diverticulosis were both considered. It appears 
that this pain has been constant for the past 9 weeks, and has 
been worked up by his PCP, including an abdominal and pelvic CT, 
which have not shown any significant findings.  On exam patient 
had no abdominal tenderness, and a benign abdomen.  At discharge 
patient had no abdominal pain.  Bowel movements were regular.    

.
*) Depression:
The patient has a psychiatric history significant for 
depression, having been treated with many medications and 
electroconvulsive therapy. He did endorse suicidal ideation to a 
nurse upon arrival to the emergency room during the postictal 
period, and was followed by psychiatry throughout his stay. 
However, from then on he denied any suicidal ideation. He did 
describe his mood as "poor," but was unable to qualify it 
further. He was continued on his home regimen of duloxetine 
while in the hospital. He will follow-up with Dr. ___ 
his depression as an outpatient. 

*) Dementia:
With patients large degree of frontal atrophy on CT scan, a 
thought of Frontal Temporal dementia was raised.  However, notes 
dating back ___ years ago suggested a dementia, with significant 
atrophy seen on CT.  Therefore it appears more likely that this 
is a dementia with a predilection to the frontal lobes.  Further 
work up will be addressed as an outpatient and patient will 
follow up with Drs ___ in the Neurology 
Clinic

*)Competence:
Patient currently has no health care proxy.  ___ wife stated she 
did not want to be involved in his health care.  Psych believes 
that he was competent to make a decision to go to a rehab center 
but will need further competence evaluation while there.  
Patient states he has a sister in ___ named ___.  
Last name is possibly ___

*)General Medical Care:
Patient was seen by Geriatrics who added on other labs for gait 
instability.  Patient will follow up with Dr. ___ 
Geriatrician for further medical care.

3. Imagine:
(1) CT head: No acute fractures or intracranial hemorrhage. 
Chronic atrophy. Old nasal bone fractures and right orbital 
foreign body. Right frontal subgaleal hematoma. 
(2) CT C-spine: No acute fractures. Multilevel cervical 
spondylosis. Mild rotation of C1 on C2 with asymmetry of the 
lateral atlantoaxial intervals, which appears slightly increased 
from prior examination. This could be due to positioning, though 
rotatory subluxation cannot be excluded.  
(3) CXR: Right basilar curvilinear opacity, possibly 
representing an area 
of rounded atelectasis. No large pleural effusion or evidence of 
congestive heart failure.
