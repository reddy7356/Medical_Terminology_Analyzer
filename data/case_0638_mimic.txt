Imaging: None - see ___ records

CT-Guided Biopsy:
Uncomplicated needle core biopsy of intermediate density right 
middle
lobe/cardiophrenic recess abnormality. Differential is broad 
including round
pneumonia or pericardial cyst with internal debris. Histologic 
analysis and
microbiological analysis is currently pending.

Pathology:
The core biopsy demonstrates an acute lung injury pattern with a 
neutrophil-predominant mixed inflammatory infiltrate accompanied 
by intra-alveolar fibrin exudates. AFB and GMS stains are 
negative. The histologic findings favor infection. An ANCA may 
be useful to help rule out vasculitis.

Brief Hospital Course:
___ with no past medical history admitted with hemoptysis 
attributed to complicated CA-PNA vs. R thoracic mass.
.
ACTIVE ISSUES:

# Hemoptysis: Extensive discussion in person with the chest 
radiologist raised concern for a solid mass of indeterminate 
etiology; this prompted a CT-guided core biopsy, which showed 
changes consistent with infection several days after the time of 
discharge.
.
# Community-acquired pneumonia: Although he had no risk factors 
for health care associated pneumonia, the patient's presentation 
was initially concerning for necrotizing pneumonia - he was 
covered broadly with vancomycin, ceftriaxone, and azithromycin. 
Cultures were sent and pending at the time of discharge. He was 
discharged on azithromycin, augmentin, and linezolid for a 
tentative course of 14 days with plans for the PCP to narrow 
according to culture data. Sputum culture after discharge showed 
oral flora; biopsy culture showed rare strep species. Blood 
cultures were still pending.
.
# Pre-renal acute kidney injury: Resolved with fluids.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
# Repeat CT-Scan will be overseen by the patient's PCP.
# Blood cultures pending
