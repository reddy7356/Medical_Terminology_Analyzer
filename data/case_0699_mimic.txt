Chief Complaint:
left ___ pain and swelling
 
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:

ORBITAL ABSCESS

 
History of Present Illness:
Ms. ___ is a ___ year old right-handed woman with complex
medical history, notable for ___ disease, followed here
at ___ by Dr. ___,  ___ valve insufficiency s/p repair 
and
closure (___), prior R temporo-occipital infarct, paroxysmal
atrial fibrillation, prior Takutsubo cardiomyopathy, s/p PEG
placement, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, GERD, Graves disease,
who presents with 3 day history of left sided headache,
retro-orbital pain and progressive ___ swelling. History 
provided
by patient and discussion with multiple family members at
bedside. 

Ms. ___ was ___ her usual state of health until 3 days ago
(___) when she began having a left sided temporal and
retro-orbital headache, throbbing ___ quality. She had no
preceding changes to her routine including trauma, fever, or
medication changes. The pain came on gradually while she was at 
a
party. The headache was associated with mild photophobia, 
without
nausea/vomiting, or visual symptoms (no visual loss, no
flashers/floaters, no diplopia, no positive visual phenomena).
Given that she has a history of chronic migraine, she initially
attributed symptoms to migraine. However, the headache was
distinctly different than her migraines ___ that it was
unilateral, and associated with retro-orbital pain. Her typical
migraines, by contrast, are rare, and the last migraine was at
least several months ago. She took Zolmig (Zolmitriptan) 2.5mg
and went to sleep. She was able to sleep through the night
without symptoms. 

The following morning, the headache persisted, which was also
atypical for her, as her migraines typically respond to Zomig.
She took additional 5mg Zomig without relief (2.5mg x2 over the
course of the morning, spaced 2 hours apart). She was quite
fatigued and slept during most of the day. As the day went on,
the left ___ became progressively swollen. By ___, the ___ was
so swollen that it was sweollen shut.  Interestingly, her pain
was relatively well controlled on Tylenol. 

Today, the swelling of the left ___ continued, refractory to 
cold
compresses. She developed significant chemosis and proptosis of
the left ___. As a result, she went to see her opathlmologist
(Dr. ___ was concerned and recommended discussion
with her neurologist (Dr. ___.  Patient was recommended to
come to ED for urgent evaluation. 

Of note, family and patient report Ms. ___ had a history of
similar symptoms (acute onset of L ___ swelling, headache and
retro-orbital pain) ___ ___. This resolved after ___ 
days
without intervention. No imaging modalities were done at this
time and etiology was unclear. 

Regarding her Parkinsonism, her course is briefly summarized
below as follows, with significant contribution from Dr. ___
note ___ ___. She first developed ___ ___, at age ___,
with right hand tremor, considered to be Parkinsonian on
evaluation by Dr. ___.  She was tried
initially on Sinemet
___ tablets, but this caused nausea, and she could not
tolerate more than 0.5 tablet of ___ TID. As a result, she
now takes 0.5 tablet QHS (12.5/100mg Sinemet) as this is the 
only
dose and time she was able to tolerate it.  Of note, she was 
also
tried on Rytary (23.75/95) by Dr. ___ with
similar results.  She has not been on a dopamine agonist. 
Instead, she takes amantadine 100 mg bid for her tremor.  She
previously tried 100 mg TID at one time, which caused musical
hallucinations. She also takes rasagiline 1 mg daily, with no
clear effect.  Her overall course of PD has progressed over the
years, and now has tremors throughout the R>L side.  She now has
great difficulty getting out of a chair, complicated by the fact
that she has recently underwent shoulder surgery.  Other 
symptoms
include difficulty dressing herself, feeding herself, 
significant
bradykinesia and stiffness. She has not had clear cognitive
complaints and no hallucinations. She does have constipation and
is on Miralax. Finally, she has REM behavior disorder symptoms
(thrashes around ___ bed) but does not get out of bed. 

Her care was transitioned from Dr. ___ to Dr. ___ ___ ___. At that time he noted that she was significantly ataxic,
and cautiously weaned Depakote off (which she was on for
seizures, see below) with improvement. 

Otherwise, she has had a complex medical course over the latter
half of ___.  
- She had repair of her mitral valve and closure of a PFO ___
___, after which she was slow to wake up ___ the ICU,
found to have non-convulsive status epilepticus. Seizures were
eventually controlled on three AEDs, and she woke up. MRI
revealed right temporo-occipital infarct, but there were no 
clear
neurological deficits noted from patient or family.   
-___ ___, she was admitted to ___ with new onset A-fib
with
rapid ventricular rate, and Takotsubo cardiomyopathy, controlled
metoprolol and apixaban.  At that time PEG was placed to 
maintain
adequate nutrition, and is still ___ place.  She takes some pills
orally, but others have to be crushed and put into the g-tube. 
Since then she had been gradually weaned off her anti-epileptic
medications by her neurologists at ___, most recently off of
Depakote as above.

Currently, patient reports she has mild left temporal headache
and retro-orbtial pain, but it is well controlled and she is not
interested ___ receiving any medication. She has left ___ 
swelling
and can only open the ___ minimally. She denies any visual loss,
diplopia, or other visual symptoms.  No jaw claudication. 

On neuro ROS, the pt reports fatigue and difficulty initiating
gait. Denies dysarthria, dysphagia, lightheadedness, vertigo,
tinnitus or hearing difficulty. Denies difficulties producing or
comprehending speech.  Denies focal weakness, numbness,
parasthesiae. No bowel or bladder incontinence or retention. 

On general review of systems, the pt denies recent fever or
chills.  No night sweats or recent weight loss or gain. Denies
cough, shortness of breath.  Denies chest pain or tightness,
palpitations.  Denies nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation 
or
abdominal pain.  No recent change ___ bowel or bladder habits.  
No

Pertinent Results:
MR brain:

abscess.  Associated left proptosis. 
3. Possible left inferior dural enhancement near the left orbit,
which may be reactive or may represent direct spread of
infection. 
4. Extensive left periorbital soft tissue swelling and contrast
enhancement without evidence for an abscess, compatible with
cellulitis/phlegmon. 
5. Small chronic infarct ___ the right superior occipital and
right inferior parietal lobes is new since the ___ MRI.
Gyriform hyperintensity on postcontrast T1 weighted images along
the infarcted area likely represents intrinsic T1 hyperintensity

compatible with cellulitis/phlegmon, without evidence for an 
abscess. 
4. Status post right partial ethmoidectomy and bilateral
maxillary antrostomies, new since ___.  Patent right frontal

Ms. ___ is a ___ year old female with ___ disease, 
hypertension, hyperlipidemia, h/o Grave's disease, h/o chronic 
sinusitis s/p sinus surgery ___ years prior, atrial fibrillation 
(on Eliquis), and MV insufficiency s/p MVR c/b stroke and 
non-convulsive status epilepticus, who presented with 3 days of

===============================
ACUTE MEDICAL ISSUES ADDRESSED:
===============================
#Ethmoidal sinusitis, left orbital abscess:
Imaging on admission revealed extensive ethmoidal sinus disease 
with medial inferior orbital wall subperiosteal abscess 
formation with extension along the superior orbit, without 
evidence of intracranial enhancement to suggest infectious 
extension. Given worsening of exam, with restricted ___ 
movements ___ the left ___, patient had a left orbitotomy with 
drainage of the orbital abscess with the ophthalmology and ENT 
teams on ___. A drain was placed, which was removed on ___. 
The ophthalmology and ENT teams followed the patient closely 
during her hospitalization.

The infectious disease team was consulted and provided 
recommendations regarding antibiotic selection. Patient was 
initially treated with broad spectrum antibiotics (ceftazidime 
--> Meropenem, vancomycin) with a 72-hour course of clindamycin 
for anti-toxin effect. Patient's cultures ultimately grew 
Pseudomonas and MSSA. She was narrowed to cefepime and Flagyl 
for a planned 6-week course (___). 

Patient had two loose stools prior to discharge, attributed to 
broad antibiotic regimen. If she has on-going loose stool, would 
consider testing for C. difficile.

#Anti-coagulation: 
On admission (___) patient's home Apixaban was held ___ 
anticipation of required surgery. Given ___ bleeding 
risk and finding of significant amount of old blood ___ draining 
the abscess, patient's Apixaban was held for an additional three 
days. She was restarted on her home Apixaban on ___.

CHRONIC MEDICAL ISSUES:
=======================
