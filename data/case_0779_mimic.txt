Brief Hospital Course:
On arrival to the ED, a right IJ line was placed for venous 
access for systolic BPs in the ___. The patient responded well 
to fluid resuscitation and did not require any blood products. 
Her wounds included a superficial laceration over the anterior 
neck without active bleeding or hematoma. On the right upper 
extremity, she had lacerations at the antecubital fossa, distal 
forearm, and volar wrist. On her left wrist, she had multiple 
lacerations at the distal forearm. 

Her neck laceration required no surgical repair. On evaluation 
by Plastic Surgery,  the lacerations on her right upper 
extremity were deemed to be superficial. Her hand exam was 
completely normal distal to the injury, and there was no 
suggestion of nerve injury. The left side  had a deeper 
laceration into the proximal carpal tunnel with a likely injury 
to the palmar cutaneous branch of the median nerve. The 
lacerations on both sides were closed with interrupted ___ nylon 
sutures. 

After her acute injuries were addressed, the patient was 
assessed by Psychiatry, who determined she would meet criteria 
for ___ (risk to self) once medically cleared. While 
inpatient, Ms. ___ required a 1-to-1 sitter then 
necessitated seclusion after being physically and verbally 
abusive towards health care staff. She was placed on a CIWA 
scale on admission but never scored. She was restarted on her 
home Seroquel once hemodynamically stable and received diazepam 
PRN (after discontinuation of CIWA scale) for anxiety. 

Ms. ___ received prophylactic antibiotic treatment for her 
wounds (cephalexin) and was also treated with ciprofloxacin for 
a UTI. (These were discontinued on day of discharge as she 
completed a 5-day course). She had a drop in hematocrit on HD2 
but had no hemodynamic compromise and required no blood 
products. Her hematocrit steadily rose thereafter. However, the 
patient did refuse blood to be drawn for labs on her last two 
days of admission. She remained hemodynamically stable (HR 
___ 100s, SBP ___ and afebrile throughout the hospital 
course. She tolerated a regular diet, voided freely, and 
ambulated without difficulty. Pain was well-controlled on oral 
pain medications. She had no pulmonary, renal, neurologic, or 
infectious issues. 

She was medically cleared for discharge on HD4 and was

require follow up with Ortho Hand Clinic for removal of her 
sutures.
