___ Cardiovascular Stress Echo Report 
CONCLUSION:
Indication: This ___ year-old male with hypertension and 
hyperlipidemia was referred for a stress test for evaluation of 
his exertional chest pain and nonspecific ST segment changes.
Medications: valsartan 80 mg ___, hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg ___, 
simvastatin 20 mg ___ 165 mg ___
Type of stress/symptoms: The patient had no symptoms at 
rest/prior to stress. The patient exercised on a modified ___ 
treadmill (3 min stages) protocol for 7 min 0 sec ___ METS) 
representing a fair exercise
capacity for age and gender. The test was stopped due to rapidly 
progressive anterior chest discomfort (peak exercise ___ and 
ischemic ST changes. In response to stress, the patient had 
anginal type pain beginning at 4.8 min of exercise (heart rate 
120bpm; systolic blood pressure 194mmHg)that resolved at 4.0 min 
(heart rate 82bpm; systolic blood pressure (170mmHg) of 
recovery.
Hemodynamics: There was resting systolic hypertension. At rest, 
the blood pressure was 170/88 mmHg and the heart rate was 73 
bpm. In response to stress, the heart rate increased to 130 bpm 
(88 % APMHR) with a
peak systolic blood pressure of 194 mmHg (peak rate-pressure 
product = ___.
ECG: The resting ECG showed sinus rhythm with diffuse 
nonspecific ST segment changes. At peak exercise, the stress ECG 
showed showed 1.5-2 mm horizontal ST segment depression 
inferolaterally and ___levation in aVR and V1. A downsloping ST segment morphology was 
noted in recovery and persisted until 12 minutes post-exercise. 
During stress there were rare atrial premature beats and 
occasional ventricular premature beats with one ventricular 
couplet.
Rest Echo: Resting echo images demonstrated mild symmetric left 
ventricular hypertrophy with a normal cavity size. There is 
normal regional left ventricular systolic function and normal 
global systolic function. The visually estimated resting left 
ventricular ejection fraction is 60-65%. Tissue Doppler suggests 
an inceased left
ventricular filling pressure (PCWP greater than 18mmHg). The 
right ventricular cavity size is normal with normal free wall 
motion. There is no pericardial effusion. Doppler demonstrates 
no aortic valve stenosis, trace aortic regurgitation, trivial 
mitral regurgitation and no resting left ventricular outflow 
tract gradient. The resting pulmonary artery systolic pressure 
could not be estimated.
Stress Echo: Echo images were acquired within 64 sec post stress 
at heart rates of 117 to 104 bpm. These demonstrated new 
regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with extensive 
severe hypokinesis of the mid
to distal anterior wall, septum, and apical ___ of the LV c/w 
LAD territory ischemia The remaining left ventricular segments 
augment appropriately. The E/e' was 18 at seconds after exercise 
and represents and an increase compared to resting baseline. 
This suggests an increase in left ventricular filling pressure 
with exercise and c/w exercise-induced diastolic dysfunction. 
There was appropriate augmentation of right
ventricular free wall motion.
FINDINGS:
LEFT VENTRICLE (LV): Mild symmetric LVH. Normal LV cavity size. 
Normal resting regional function. Normal
LVEF (>55%) No resting LVOT gradient.
RIGHT VENTRICLE (RV): Normal cavity size. Resting RV function 
normal.
AORTIC VALVE (AV): No stenosis. Trace aortic regurgitation.
MITRAL VALVE (MV): Trivial mitral regurgitation.
TRICUSPID VALVE (TV): Physiologic tricuspid regurgitation. 
Resting pulmonary artery systolic pressure undetermined.
PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.

Brief Hospital Course:
Presented for stress echocardiogram which was noted to be 
positive and was referred to cardiac catheterization.  Cardiac 
catheterization revealed significant coronary artery disease and 
cardiac surgery was consulted.  He was admitted and preoperative 
workup.  On ___ he was taken to the operating room and underwent 
coronary artery bypass graft, see operative report for further 
details.  He was taken to the intensive care unit for post 
operative management.  Later that evening he was weaned from 
sedation, awoke neurologically intact and was extubated without 
complications.  POD 1 his CT were removed after being placed on 
water seal and he remained in the intensive care unit on 
neosynephrine that was weaned off by the evening of post 
operative day one.  POD 2 he was started on betablocker and 
diuretic. He was seen by physical therapy for strength and 
mobility with recommendation for home. Additionally foley was 
removed he was able to void but was noted for high post void 
residual was started on Flomax and required straight 
catheterization once.  POD 3 his epicardial wires were removed, 
he was voiding and increasing in ambulation
