History of Present Illness:
Mr. ___ is a ___ year old man with right hip osteoarthritis 
s/p
total hip replacement ___, who presents as a transfer from ___ with E coli bacteremia, septic right hip joint and
transaminitis. 

The patient was admitted to ___ on ___ with nausea,
vomiting and weakness. He was septic with lactate to 4.6 and
admitted to the ICU. It is unclear if he ever required pressors.
He was found to have sepsis from pyelonephritis secondary to
right ureteral calculus with obstructive uropathy. Imaging at
this time showed right hydronephrosis and creatinine was 2.7. He
underwent a cystoscopy on ___ with stent placement; creatinine
downtrended to 0.___lood culturs grew
pan-sensitive E. coli, and he was transitioned from IV
ceftriaxone to oral cefpodoxime. 

He initially improved, and then began to decline again with
rising WBC (37 at admission, down to 17.2 then up to 27) and new
right hip pain. He notably also had rising LFTs: admission Tbili
1.5, Dbili 0.5, ALP 181, ALT 32, AST 35; uptrended to Tbili 2.5,
Dbili 2.3, ALP 471, ALT 57, AST 51. He had a liver ___ on ___ 
and
___ ___, both of which were unremarkable. 

His hip pain was preventing him from putting full weight on it,
and he underwent a joint aspiration on ___ that drained frank
pus. At this time oral cefpodoxime was changed back to IV
ceftriaxone. The patient was transferred to ___ for further
evaluation of septic joint and transaminitis. 

Upon arrival to ___, the patient shares he is tired. He also
reports that he has been having hiccups, requiring thorazine at
___. He has never had hiccups before this.

RADIOLOGY
Bilat lower extremity veins U/S ___
No evidence of deep venous thrombosis in the right or left lower
extremity veins. 

CTA Chest ___
IMPRESSION:  
1. No evidence of pulmonary embolism or aortic abnormality. 
2. Calcified and noncalcified pleural plaques, likely relates to
remote exposure of asbestosis. 
3. Subtle upper lobe ground-glass opacities, likely atelectasis. 

4. Mild left subclavian artery stenosis. 
5. Small hiatal hernia. 

___ ERCP 
The scout film was normal.  
•The major papilla was successfully cannulated using a clevecut
sphincterotome.  
•Contrast was injected and there was brisk flow through the
ducts. 
•Contrast extended to the entire biliary tree.  
•Contrast injection revealed no filling defects.  
•However, given history of sepsis, jaundice and elevated LFT's a
___ 7CM stent was placed in the CBD.  
•The final occlusion cholangiogram showed no evidence of filling
defects in the CBD.  
•Excellent bile and contrast drainage was seen endoscopically 
and
fluoroscopically.  
•I supervised the acquisition and interpretation of the
fluoroscopic images.  
•The quality of the fluoroscopic images was good  
•Otherwise normal ercp to third part of the duodenum

Radiology reviewed in ___ Records, significant for:
- ___ CT ___
1. 3 x 4 mm distal right ureteral calculus with associated
mild/moderate obstructive uropathy proximal to the stone.
2. Small pleural effusions and bilateral lower lobe
consolidation.

- ___ ___ abdominal ultrasound exam. No evidence of
hydronephrosis on either side.

- ___ ___ pleural effusions. No evidence for biliary dilatation
or obstruction, or gallbladder inflammation. No concerning
hepatic abnormality identified. 

- ___ Right hip arthrocentesis ___ of right hip prosthesis demonstrates purulent
material consistent with septic joint.

- ___ CXR
In comparison with the study of ___, there has been
placement of right subclavian PICC line that extends about to 
the
level of the cavoatrial junction. Continued enlargement of the
cardiac silhouette with tortuosity of the aorta and elevation of
pulmonary venous pressure.  The left hemidiaphragm is now poorly
seen, consistent with volume loss in the lower lobe and pleural
effusion. Given the changes described above, it would be very
difficult to unequivocally exclude superimposed pneumonia in the
appropriate clinical setting, especially 
in the absence of a lateral view. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
===============
PATIENT SUMMARY
===============
Mr. ___ is a ___ old man with a history of R hip 
osteoarthritis s/p total hip replacement ___, who presented s/p 
cystoscopy and ureteral stent to ___ with urosepsis and E 
Coli bacteremia c/b septic R hip and elevated liver function 
tests, transferred for further management, now on ceftriaxone 
s/p unremarkable ERCP and POD#5 from R hip I&D + liner exchange.

============
ACUTE ISSUES
============

#Septic joint 
#E coli bacteremia 
Patient admitted ___ to ___ with septic shock (renal 
failure, elevated lactate, thrombocytopenia) secondary to E. 
Coli bacteremia, with likely source of R ureteral calculus and 
pyelonephritis. After improving at OSH on IV ceftriaxone s/p 
cystoscopy and R ureteral stent, he then decompensated again and 
was found to have a right septic hip joint ___ E coli urosepsis, 
high WBC and elevated LFTs (esp. Tbili 3.2, AP 454), and 
transferred to ___. Ortho consulted and performed R hip I&D 
with head and liner exchange ___. Afebrile, downtrending WBC. 
ID consulted and recommended 6 weeks of IV ABx (ceftriaxone 2g 
q24h). PICC placed. ___ consulted and recommended home ___. 
Continued on Lovenox 40mg sc qd for ___fter 
orthopedic procedure. No positive blood cultures at ___, but 
surgical wound culture grew E.Coli susceptible to Ceftriaxone, 
resistant to amoxicillin - consistent with blood cultures from 
___. Small induration and erythema near incision site on day 
of discharge. Attempted drainage, but no pus to drain. Started 
on po Clindamycin w Ortho f/u on ___.

#Elevated LFTs 
At OSH Tbili 2.5 (Dbili 2.3), ALP 471 and AST/ALT in ___ prior 
to transfer. Upon transfer Tbili 3.5, ALP 454 and AST/ALT in 
___. S/p unremarkable ___ and ___ ultrasound at ___. Now s/p 
ERCP that was unremarkable, but CBD stent was placed. LFTs 
downtrended. Ruled likely due to cholestasis. Hep serologies 
negative. CBD stent will need to be removed in 3mo.

#Anemia 
Normocytic anemia worsening since admission. Reticulocyte index 
low, reduced TIBC, elevated ferritin. Likely acute infection + 
anemia of chronic disease along with hemodilution in post-op 
period. Stabilized. Needs further w/u outpatient and possible 
iron repletion if persistent. On day of planned discharge, 
became dyspneic with exertion and tachycardic. Initially 
concerned for PE, but negative CTA and LENNI. Ruled symptomatic 
anemia and transfused 1U pRBC w good response.

#Hiccups
Bothersome hiccups began after ureteral stent placement. Had 
stopped briefly after I&D but since recurred. Unclear etiology, 
possibly anesthesia-related. Somewhat responsive to thorazine 
and baclofen. Started on tesalon perles.

#Acute kidney injury, resolved
Cr was 3 on admission to OSH; now down to 0.8. 

#Demand Ischemia
Troponin T was 0.02 on admission to ___ to 0.08, then 
0.06 on ___. Likely demand ischemia in setting of sepsis.

#Pressure Ulcer
Pressure ulcer developed on R heel. Wound consulted and dressing 
applied.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,

You were admitted to the hospital as a transfer due to infection 
of your R hip, which developed after your infected kidney stone 
caused a bloodstream infection. While you were here, we 
performed an ERCP (where GI looked at your gallbladder and 
pancreas) which showed no clear reason for your liver labs to be 
abnormal. They placed a stent to ensure the duct stayed open and 
your labs improved. The orthopedic surgeons also performed a 
procedure to drain and replace the lining of your hip. We 
treated you with antibiotics. Your pain, fever, and labs all 
improved.

The evening you were supposed to be going home, you had some 
shortness of breath with exercise and a fast heart rate. Because 
of your surgery, we were concerned you might have had a blood 
clot and we performed a CT of your chest and Ultrasound of your 
leg to look. Fortunately there was no blood clot or other 
finding concerning in your lungs. We believe you had these 
symptoms from your anemia. We gave you a unit of blood and you 
improved significantly.

The last day of your hospitalization, you had some redness, pain 
and swelling near your incision site. The orthopedic doctors 
tried to ___ it, but there wasn't any pus to drain. We started 
you on an oral antibiotic and they would like to see you in 
clinic on ___. You should be called about setting up an 
appointment. Please call ___ if you do not hear from 
anybody.

When you get home, you will need to follow up with your 
urologist about the stent to get surgery to have it removed. You 
will need to continue antibiotics for 6 weeks from the date of 
surgery - ___ until ___. Because of all these 
antibiotics, we would like you to take a probiotic.

You need to continue the Lovenox shots once daily for 4 weeks 
from the date of surgery. The prescription has been called in to 
your pharmacy.

Please call your PCP or return if you have severe fever, pain, 
or other concerning symptoms.

Please follow up with your primary care doctor.

It was a pleasure caring for you.

Sincerely,

Your ___ team

aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic 
stenosis is not present. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. 
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no 
mitral valve prolapse. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic 
pressure is normal. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial 
effusion.
IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with 
normal cavity size, and regional/global systolic function. 
Normal right ventricular cavity size and systolic function. 
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of ___, 
the anterior wall is no longer hypokinetic. The degree of mitral 
regurgitation and tricuspid regurgitation is less.  

R HIP PLAIN FILM ___

___, some of which were ___ positive; he is thus at 
risk for a
delayed hemolytic transfusion reaction. The clinical team was 
contacted
by phone yesterday and advised to be aware for signs of delayed
hemolysis such as an unexplained fever, drop in hemoglobin, 
decrease in
haptoglobin, rise in LDH and rise in bilirubin. If the patient 
does
exhibit signs/symptoms of a delayed hemolytic transfusion 
reaction,
treatment is supportive with transfusions of compatible RBCs as
necessary for symptomatic anemia.
 
In the future, Mr. ___ should receive ___ negative 
products for
all red cell transfusions. Approximately 71% of ABO compatible 
blood
will be ___ negative. A wallet card and letter stating the

continue to monitor nutritional status with PO intake and 
consult with Nutrition & Speech/Swallow as to when Dobhoff can 
be removed. Until that time, continue with TF formulation as 
described.

ISSUES ADDRESSED:
=================
# Sepsis
# Pneumonia, presumed secondary to aspiration 
Patient presented with AMS ISO PNA. He was initiated on 
vancomycin, meropenem, and MNZ, vancomycin & MNZ were 
discontinued. The meropenem was briefly discontinued in favor of 
pip-taz, to which the patient had a febrile reaction, unclear if 
this was a hemolytic reaction. Transitioned back to meropenem & 
completed a 7-day course. His BCX & UCX remained negative and he 
had no further concerns for infection. 

# AMS
Patient presented w/ AMS ISO sepsis w/ PNA + hypernatremia. 
Improved significantly with treatment of his infection as well 
as correction of his sodium. He was alert, oriented, and engaged 
by the time of discharge.

# Hypernatremia: Hypernatremic during admission, thought to be 
___ poor PO ISO of fear of aspiration. Addressed with IV fluids 
as well as free water flushes through Dobbhoff tube. His sodium 
was 144 on discharge.

# Neurological deficits, subacute stroke:
Noted to have lingual pumping, nystagmus, dysphagia, & b/l upper 
extremity hyper reflexia. Neurology was consulted for 
evaluation. MRI brain shows no acute infarct, 2 punctuate late 
subacute infarcts, communicating hydrocephalus & small-vessel 
disease. 
CTA H/N re-assuring. Will have Neurology f/u on d/c for stroke. 

# Mild-Moderate C. difficile:
PO vancomycin 125mg Q6H (___), to be continued until 1 week 
after TMP-SMX is discontinued.

# Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation
-Rhythm: Currently NSR.
-Rate: BB as above. 
-AC: Deferred ISO DAPT & surgical site hematoma, CHA2DS2VASc 3, 
HAS-BLED 3. 
-Cardiology consulted for question of triple therapy AC ISO 
NSTEMI & recent strokes of unclear etiology though possibly 
related to AFIB. Cardiology recommended to d/c metoprolol, begin 
sotalol 80mg BID & w/hold triple therapy (continue DAPT). We 
started sotalol w/ close monitoring of QTC (453 on d/c). At d/c 
he will continue sotalol & DAPT w/ close Cardiology f/u. 

# NSTEMI s/p DES to LAD
Occurred previous admission this month. Continued DAPT w/ 
clopidogrel + ASA (see above).
Discontinued metoprolol but started sotalol as above. Continued 
statin. 

# Prosthetic joint infection: Pt presented on cefepime for 
ongoing treatment of infection of right prosthetic hip joint. 
Covered w/ meropenem as above, initiated on ciprofloxacin ___ 
for chronic suppression per ID, started on TMP-SMX ___ instead 
of ciprofloxacin ISO beginning sotalol, will continue 
indefinitely until ID follow-up. 

# Transaminitis:
LFTs at level consistent with past hospitalization this month. 
Etiology was unclear though did coincide w/ initiation of statin 
therapy last hospitalization for NSTEMI, CK 284. MRCP 
unremarkable. AMA, anti-smooth muscle Ab negative, ___ positive 
1:160.
Consulted Hepatology for further work-up and management: Rising 
LFTS coincided w/ statin initiation & thus far best explanation 
is statin drug-induced liver injury. Ultimately the benefits of 
statin use favored the risks of discontinuing. Plan for monthly 
monitoring as an outpatient. 

# Normocytic anemia:
# History of AIHA:
Noted on previous admission, Hematology had evaluated last 
admission & felt that his anemia was hemolytic in nature ___ CTX 
use. Continue anemia on this admission, Hematology re-consulted 
and felt that represented lingering drug-induced hemolytic 
anemia (which can take several weeks to improve). Also of note 
is anti-E antibody, making him susceptible to hemolytic 
transfusion reactions, and has received 13 transfusions since 
___, some of which were E-Ag+ & could lead to delayed 
hemolytic transfusion reaction. Finally, had developed large 
anterior right thigh
hematoma which is likely resorbing. We monitored and provided 
folate supplementation and plan for continued outpatient CBC to 
evaluate needs for transfusion. 

# Stage II pressure ulcer, R heel. Present on admission. 
Continued with pressure offloading and dressing changes

Addendum:
# Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation
# Subacute stroke: Patient noted to have lingual pumping, 
nystagmus, dysphagia, and upper extremity hyper-reflexia 
Neurology was consulted and MRI revealed late subacute infarcts, 
communicating hydrocephalus, and small vessel disease. CTA head
and neck reassuring. He is on statin, and DAPT for NSTEMI though 
not on anticoagulation. CHADS2 score reveals 8.5% annual risk of 
stroke with HAS-BLED score of 3 (5.8% risk of bleed). Given 
anemia and risk of initiation of triple therapy,
cardiology was consulted to assist with management 
(consideration of rivaroxiban and clopidogrel per PIONEER 
trial). Cardiology advised rhythm control as a way to minimize 
risk for stroke and to avoid triple anticoagulation given risk 
of bleed.
He was initiated on sotalol with stable Qtc monitoring. After 
discussion with ID, his prophylactic Cipro (for PJI) was 
switched to Bactrim given risk of Qtc prolongation with Cipro 
and sotalol. He was continued on aspirin and Plavix. Plan for 
outpatient cardiology follow up.

•A plastic stent was found emerging from the major papilla. 
•The stent was removed with a 20-mm snare. 
•The major papilla appeared normal.
•The bile duct was successfully cannulated using a Rx 
sphincterotome preloaded with a 0.035in guidewire. 
•Contrast was injected and there was brisk flow through the 
ducts. 
•Contrast extended to the entire biliary tree. 
•Contrast injection revealed no filling defects in the biliary 
tree. 
•A biliary sphincterotomy was not performed due to patient being 
on plavix. 
•The sphincterotome was exchanged for a balloon. 
•The biliary tree was swept with a 9-12mm balloon starting at 
the bifurcation. 
•Small amount of sludge was successfully removed. 
•The CBD and CHD were swept repeatedly until no further sludge 
was seen. 
•The final occlusion cholangiogram showed no evidence of filling 
defects in the CBD. 
•Given, improvement in LFT's and normal cholangiogram, decision 
was made not to place CBD stent and follow patient clinically. 
•Excellent bile and contrast drainage was seen endoscopically 
and fluoroscopically. 
•I supervised the acquisition and interpretation of the 
fluoroscopic images.
• The quality of the fluoroscopic images was good. 
• Otherwise normal ercp to third part of the duodenum
 
 
Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ is a ___ male with acomplicated past medical 
history including CAD
s/p NSTEMI with stent to the LAD on dual antiplatelet therapy 
and high dose statin, C. difficile infection currently on PO 
vancomycin, elevated LFTs status post CBD stent on ___, 
prosthetic joint right hip septic arthritis currently on
Bactrim prophylaxis who presents from ___ where he was 
admitted with brown emesis and elevated LFTs.

#Elevated LFT's/Emesis:
During his last admission the etiology of his elevated LFTs was 
thought to be secondary to statins seen since it seemed to 
coincide with initiation of statin after his NSTEMI.  AMA, 
anti-smooth muscle antibody negative, ___ ___.  Hepatology 
was consulted and they also thought that statin initiation was 
the
best explanation.  The risks and benefits of a statin at that 
time favored the continuation of the statin discontinuation.  
The plan was for monthly LFT monitoring as an outpatient. Pt 
underwent repeat ERCP on ___ for evaluation of previously 
placed CBD stent and stent was found to be protruding from the 
papilla.  it was removed but no other obvious cause of elevated 
LFT's was seen.  Small amounts of sludge were removed from the 
biliary tree.  Post-procedural LFT's were downtrending and pt 
was tolerating a regular diet with no further episodes of emesis 
or abdominal pain on discharge.

#Hiccups: Pt with recurrent bouts of hiccups since ___.  He 
was given prn Baclofen with good relief. 

# Hx of subacute stroke: Found to have 2 punctuate late subacute 
infarcts during prior admission, communicating hydrocephalus & 
small-vessel disease. He was continued on DAPT and statin.

# Mild-Moderate C. difficile:  Continued PO vancomycin 125mg Q6H 
(___), to be continued until 1 week after TMP-SMX is 
discontinued.

# Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation: Was in NSR during 
hospitalization.  He was continued on home sotalol.  Not on AC 
given need for DAPT and high bleeding risk (surgical site 
hematoma)

# NSTEMI s/p DES to LAD: Continued BB, DAPT, statin per above

# Prosthetic joint infection: Continued Bactrim suppression. Has 
ID f/u on ___.

LFTs improved after, thought to be ___ cholestasis. Ortho
performed R hip I&D with head and liner exchange ___. He was
planned for 6 weeks of IV ABx (ceftriaxone 2g q24h; PICC in 
Right
arm), and Lovenox 40mg sc qd for 4 weeks after orthopedic
procedure. 

___ he was admitted to ___, after presenting with
dry cough, fatigue/malaise, noted to be febrile 102 and
tachycardic . Got vanc/zosyn ___. CXR, CT
chest/abdomen/pelvis were all initially read as negative, but on
further review a possible R hip abscess/gas was noted by
radiology. Patient was transferred to ___ for further
evaluation. 

In the ED, Patient was found to again be tachycardic up to 130s,
febrile 101, MAP 65 (not his baseline). Improved with fluids.
Patient was also nauseous and having bilious emesis. LFTs
improved from prior. Leukocytosis is increased from outside
hospital labs. Obtain CT scan of the abdomen pelvis which did 
not
show any signs of obstruction. Again was seen gas and fluid in
the right hip. Orthopedics was consulted. In discussion with
orthopedics, they have low suspicion for septic arthritis as
patient is able to move his right hip and has actually improved
pain from prior. Ortho removed his staples. They recommend
medicine admission and will follow. They will discuss need for 
___
guided tap. Discussed with ERCP as patient had recent ERCP. Do
not think symptoms attributed to recent ERCP.
 
CT A/P Showed:
1. Status post right total hip arthroplasty with locule of gas 
noted in the right hip joint space is well as a joint effusion 
that appears to be
communicating with a collection posterior to the greater 
trochanter measuring
2.9 x 5.4 by cm. In combination with fever and leukocytosis, 
this finding is
highly suspicious for postoperative infection.
2. Trace left pleural effusion.
3. Right nephroureteral stent appears to be in appropriate 
position.
4. Several bilateral nonobstructing renal calculi.

He Received: 
___ 01:37 IV Acetaminophen IV 1000 mg ___  
___ 03:01 IV Piperacillin-Tazobactam  ___

Upon arrival to the floor, patient does not have any specific
complaints. He reports presenting to ___ after having a 
low
temp noted by ___ a few days ago. He has a dry cough that 
started
a few weeks ago (after his admission for septic arthritis). He
sometimes has dry heaves after coughing fits, and occasionally
has a small amount of post-tussive liquid emesis, happens about
___ times a week. No hematesis or hemoptysis. Has been having
loose stools different from his baseline, but only 1 BM
yesterday. Reprots urinary frequency. Denies CP, SOB, N/V,
abdominal pain, constipation, hematochezia, melena, dysuria. He
denies any increased pain or limitation in mobility of his R 
hip.
He has been ambulating at home with crutches without problems.

IMAGING: 
=======================
___ CXR
Right PIC line ends in the low SVC.  Lungs are grossly clear.  
No pleural 
effusions.  Heart size normal.  No pneumothorax. 

___ CT RLE
1. 20.9 x 9.7 x 4.5 cm intramuscular hematoma centered in the 
right vastus 
lateralis.  No active extravasation identified. 
2. Right hip joint effusion with small foci of gas seen in the 
joint space.  Given the time interval since surgery in early 
___, in the absence of recent known instrumentation of the 
right hip, findings raise concern for possible right hip joint 
infection.  Clinical correlation is requested. 
3. Diffuse subcutaneous soft tissue edema and skin thickening. 
4. Patent iliac and right lower extremity arterial vasculature, 
with scattered areas of mild luminal narrowing due to mixed 
calcified and noncalcified atherosclerotic plaque, as above.  
Note, due to contrast bolus timing, the study cannot evaluate 
for the presence or absence of venous thrombosis. 

___ CTA CHEST
1. No evidence of pulmonary embolism up to the segmental level. 
2. No aortic abnormality. 
3. Multifocal opacities, possibly pneumonia, involving bilateral 
upper and 
right middle lobe.  Pleural effusions 

___ CT ABD PELVIS
1. Right total hip arthroplasty with locule is of gas noted in 
right hip joint and moderate joint effusion, which appears 
relatively unchanged compared to prior.  Interval resolution of 
adjacent collection. 
2. Moderate bilateral, nonhemorrhagic pleural effusions with 
adjacent 
compressive atelectasis without focal consolidation. 
3. Unchanged common bile duct stent, no evidence of biliary 
dilatation.  
Unchanged nephroureteral stent, no hydronephrosis.  Again noted 
are several non-obstructing renal calculi, more notable on the 
right. 

___ LIVER AND GALLBLADDER US
1.  No evidence of intrahepatic or extrahepatic biliary 
dilatation.  Note is made of the indwelling CBD stent placed by 
ERCP. 
2.  No evidence of gallbladder distention or stones. 
3.  Incidental note of small to moderate right and trace left 
pleural 
effusions. 

___ CARDIAC CATH AND STENT TO LAD
Impressions:
1. NSTEMI with hazy mid LAD lesion treated with a long DES.
2. The RCA has a TO with bridging collaterals
Recommendations
1. 6 Months of DAPT

___ CARDIAC STRESS TEST
IMPRESSION: No anginal type symptoms or ischemic EKG changes. 
Nuclear 
report sent separately. 

___ CARDIAC STRESS PERFUSION STUDY
1. Predominantly fixed, small, severe perfusion defect involving 
the RCA 
territory. 
2. Increased left ventricular cavity size.  Mild systolic 
dysfunction with 
hypokinesis of the basal inferior wall.   

___ ECHO
Regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction c/w CAD. Normal 
right ventricular cavity size and systolic function. Moderate 
mitral regurgitation, likely related to tethering of the 
posterior leaflet.  

 
Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ is an ___ yo previously healthy man with infected 
prosthetic hip s/p I&D, readmitted for recurrent septic 
arthritis. Repeat wash out was c/b NSTEMI s/p LAD PCI ___. 
Course was further c/b hypoxemic respiratory failure (requiring 
MICU), HAP, autoimmune hemolytic anemia (likely ___ ceftriaxone) 
and large R thigh hematoma.

# SEVERE SEPSIS
# SEPTIC ARTHRITIS OF RIGHT PROSTHETIC HIP
Likely due to E. coli UTI ___, with wash outs ___ and ___ 
growing E coli. Still has some retained hardware. We continued 
him on cefepime while inpatient and he will continue this until 
___. ID will follow up with him outpatient. 

# NSTEMI S/P DES TO LAD
# CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE
An 80% stenosis was found in the proximal LAD on cardiac cath 
(___). A stent was placed and he was started on DAPT. No 
ongoing chest pain. He will need to continue aspirin/Plavix for 
at least 6 months, and should also continue on a statin. Avoid 
platelet transfusions given risk for stent thrombosis. 

# ACUTE HYPOXEMIC RESPIRATORY FAILURE
# ___ HOSPITAL-ACQUIRED PNEUMONIA
He was previously intubated in the ICU. He has no ongoing 
hypoxemia or symptoms. He
finished full course of vanc/cefepime x 8 days (___), 
azithro x 5 days.

# RIGHT THIGH HEMATOMA WITH ACUTE BLOOD LOSS ANEMIA
Now stable, s/p vitamin K 5 mg POx2 for elevated ___ (now 
normalized). Patient feels much better on day of discharge; no 
pain. 

# COLD AUTOIMMUNE HEMOLYTIC ANEMIA
At time of discharge, Heme/Onc suspects medication toxicity 
(ceftriaxone is most likely culprit) rather than malignancy 
since smear and flow cytometry were benign. Mycoplasma IgM was 
negative. He was continued on cefepime rather than switching to 
ceftriaxone as previously planned. Hgb stabilized after several 
blood transfusions. 

# PAROXYSMAL ATRIAL FIBRILLATION: 
He was started on amiodarone but it was stopped due to 
transaminitis on ___. Briefly on diltiazem drip, stopped with 
concern for sepsis. Now in sinus rhythm. We continued him on his 
home metoprolol. No AC given already on DAPT with persistent 
anemia and hematoma. ___ reconsider on an outpatient basis if 
his HCT improves.

# ASYMPTOMATIC HYPOTENSION
He had SBP ___ on ___, asymptomatic. Suspect predominant 
process is blood loss, with contribution from deconditioning. No 
e/o new infection, heart failure, PE, tamponade. Now resolved 
with SBP 110's-120's over the past couple of days.

# HX OF KIDNEY STONES
Nonobstructing stones were seen on CT abdomen. Wife states that 
patient's urologist (at ___ said the stones should be 
removed. They were previously not removed due to bacteremia. No 
surgical intervention during this hospitalization because of 
patient's other acute issues.

# ABNORMAL LIVER FUNCTION TESTS: 
LDH/bili elevation likely due to hemolysis. Unclear etiology for 
AST/ALT and Alk Phos elevations. Downtrending AST/ALT, LDH, and 
Alk phos. Had CBD stent placed but no obstruction seen on ERCP. 
Abdominal exam benign.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___, 

It was a pleasure to care for you at ___ 
___. Please find detailed discharge instructions 
below: 

WHY WERE YOU ADMITTED TO THE HOSPITAL? 
- You were admitted because you had fevers and a hip infection.

WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU IN THE HOSPITAL? 
- You had findings on imaging that were concerning for a right 
hip joint infection. 
- You received IV antibiotics to treat your infection. 
- You went to the operating room for a "washout" of your right 
hip joint and replacement of parts of the joint prosthesis. The 
surgeons confirmed that your right hip joint was infected. 
- You had a heart evaluation prior to surgery, which showed that 
you have underlying coronary artery disease. We started you on 
preventative medications to treat your coronary artery disease 
(aspirin, atorvastatin, clopidogrel). You also received a stent 
in one of the major arteries of your heart.
- Your red blood cell count was low and you received several 
blood transfusions
- You had a blood collection in your right thigh. It stabilized 
on its own and did not require intervention.

WHAT SHOULD YOU DO WHEN YOU LEAVE THE HOSPITAL? 
- Please take all your medications as prescribed. It is VERY 
important that you continue your aspirin and Plavix 
(clopidogrel). If you do not take these medications, you will be 
at risk of having a heart attack. 
- Please go to all your follow up appointments as scheduled (see 
below). 
- Please work with physical therapy to regain your strength. 

We wish you the best,

- Your ___ treatment team 
 
Followup Instructions:
