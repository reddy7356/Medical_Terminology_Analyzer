Brief Hospital Course:
___ is a ___ with a history HTN, paroxysmal AFib, 
diabetes, recurrent DVTs on Coumadin, CKD (awaiting renal 
transplant), adrenal hyperplasia b/l adrenelectomy, recent 
colonoscopy with polyp removal presenting with BRBPR and 
left-sided flank pain. Presented with a drop in his hemoglobin 
from 9.4 to 7.9 (baseline in the ___ range), and punctate 
nonobstructing kidney stones. Workup negative for bleeding 
source. 

ACUTE ISSUES:
===============
#BRBPR:
#Anemia: Pt presented with recurrent BRBPR with supratherapeutic 
INR. Differential initially included hemorrhoids, AVMs vs. less 
likely diverticular bleeding
or polyps. INR reversed w/ IV vitamin K 10 mg in the ED. 
Warfarin was subsequently held. He remained HD stable throughout 
his hospital course, and initially did not have any BRBPR after 
admission. In total he required 3 units PRBC. Given hemodynamic 
stability and 2 recent colonoscopies with no bleeding source 
prior to admission, GI team deferred colonoscopy. He had upper 
endoscopy and capsule endoscopy with no evidence of bleeding. 
Retic count elevated, iron slightly low. CT abd/pelv with no e/o 
RP bleed or other bleeding source. Hemolysis labs unremarkable. 
He was started on 8000 units of Epogen three times weekly given 
CKD. On ___ pt was being prepped for discharge but had one 
episode of hematochezia, so stayed overnight. HH remained 
stable. Colorectal surgery was consulted for evaluation of 
hemorrhoids, and deferred intervention given no active bleeding. 
Patient was discharged with PCP and GI followup, with plan to 
reinitiate warfarin without bridging. He was counseled on 
symptoms of GI bleed and when to return to the hospital. 
Hemoglobin on discharge 8.9.

#Anticoagulation:
#?HIT: 
# Multiple DVT on lifelong anticoagulation: We have no 
documented evidence of HIT, but pt and wife say he has had 
issues with low platelets and heparin in the past. However, his 
wife is positive he has been on lovenox since having the 
platelet issue after being on a heparin gtt. Hematology progress 
note from ___ under
external records tab says patient at some point was 
anticoagulated with fondaparinux due to question sensitivity to 
heparin in the past. THis note also recommends lifelong 
anticoagulation I/s/o multiple DVTs, although hypercoagulable
workup was negative and all 3 DVTs had potential triggers (L 
calf trauma, immobilization I/s/o meningitis, long car trip). 
Given uncertainty re: heparin allergy/HIT, heparin products were 
avoided. We discussed starting an argatroban drip with patient 
and wife once his blood counts were stable to see if he would 
re-bleed, but they deferred and preferred to restart patient's 
warfarin without a bridge. We did send a PF4 antibody, which was 
within normal limits but does not rule HIT out. 

#L flank pain: Noted to have small, nonobstructing calculi on 
CT, but otherwise no radiographic findings to explain symptoms. 
UA with small blood. No e/o CT scan from ___ of any concerning 
pathology. Pt has a h/o kidney stones, and he said pain felt 
similar. He required several days of IV narcotics and requested 
IV fluids. After several days he says he passed a small stone 
(not witnessed by RN or MD), and subsequently did not require 
any further IV narcotics. Continued home bentyl, pregablin, 
amitriptyline. 

#AF: Pt with episode of AF with RVR evening of ___, does not 
appear in ___ medical history but he says he has had it 
previously, "four times in my life". Now back to NSR. 
CHA2DS2-VASc 4. Warfarin was held I/s/o bleed. Continued home 
propranolol, did not switch to metoprolol given paroxysmal 
nature of AF and the fact that pt has been on propranolol for 
years with good BP control. Warfarin restarted on discharge. If 
patient cannot tolerate anticoagulation going forward because of 
recurrent GI bleed, may consider ___ procedure to reduce 
stroke risk with AFib. 

# HTN ___ adrenal hyperplasia
# Adrenal insufficiency: BP meds were initially held i/s/o GI 
bleed. Pt subseqently with repeated episodes of HTN with 
SBP>180. He says he is typically much better controlled at home. 
Improved with resolution of complete home regimen as below:
- Continue amLODIPine 10 mg PO DAILY 
- Continue CloNIDine 0.3 mg PO BID 
- Continue Fludrocortisone Acetate 0.2 mg PO BID 
- restarted home Propranolol 80 mg PO BID
- Continue Hydrocortisone 20 mg PO QAM 
- Continue Hydrocortisone 10 mg PO QHS 

CHRONIC ISSUES:
===============

# CKD Stage V undergoing evaluation for renal transplantation 
(possible LRRT with brother as donor). No current indications
for RRT. ___ remained stable. 

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES
===================
[] if patient cannot tolerate anticoagulation going forward, may 
be candidate for Watchman procedure to reduce stroke risk with 
AFib. 
[] please check CBC at upcoming PCP appointment to ensure 
stability (hemoglobin on discharge 8.9)

Summary: ___ h/o DVT on AC, adrenal hyperplasia s/p b/l 
adrenalectomy, CKD awaiting renal transplant p/w acute abdominal 
pain s/p screening colonoscopy/polypectomy w/o perforation on 
imaging. Treated with abx, bowel rest, fluids for possible 
postpolypectomy electrocoagulation syndrome.

Mr. ___ presented to the ED following screening colonoscopy 
and polypectomy. A portable CXR and CT abd/pelvis were 
subsequently obtained, with no signs of perforation. The patient 
was started on IV zosyn while made NPO on IVF and bowel rest. 
Over the next two days the patient's pain subsequently decreased 
and he was started on a regular diet. He tolerated this well 
with continued observation given his ___ medical issues and 
current steroid treatment. 

By HD 3 the patient was stable and prepared for discharge. He 
was ambulating well, voiding, and his pain was greatly 
diminished. He plans on following up with GI and his 
___ clinic as he was restarted on Coumadin with a 110 
mg daily Lovenox bridge prior to discharge for his hx of 
recurrent DVTs. He has an appointment to follow up in 3 days 
time. He will also be discharged with Augmentin for antibiotic 
coverage for a seven day course. He may follow up with the 
colorectal surgery clinic if any issues arise. At this time the 
patient has expressed understanding and readiness for discharge.

who was admitted for progressive, stuttering chest pain over two
weeks. Coronary angiogram (___) revealed multi-vessel CAD.

# Multi-vessel coronary artery disease
The patient presented with progressive, stuttering atypical 
chest
pain, with coronary angiogram demonstrating multi-vessel 
coronary
artery disease (aneurysmal proximal LAD + 70% lesion; 60% RCA
lesion). No acute culprit lesion that clearly explains the new
chest pain, though his syndrome could certainly be related to 
his underlying obstructive CAD. Of note, TTE demonstrated LVEF
60%, but severely dilated ___ 7.6cm) with 5.2cm asc. aorta and

transitioned
to more robust BP med e.g. carvedilol)
- Goal HR 60-70's, Goal SBP<130
- Start nitroglycerin drip PRN for chest pain.
- Continue to hold plavix
- Plan for surgical revascularization later this week (+ aortic
root replacement/AVR)
- **He will require stress dose steroids prior to OR given
adrenal insufficiency --> will coordinate with CT surgery**

# Aortopathy with aortic insufficiency
He has an aortic root aneurysm (5.2cm) and moderate AR per
report. 
- Surgery ___

# Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation
Not anticoagulated given history of bleed. Briefly flipped in
afib while on HD, now back in sinus rhythm

home to take care of his daughter who is special needs. 
Outpatient follow up was scheduled.  
- PO PPI BID given lower likelihood of upper source.
- Held warfarin and enoxaparin while bleeding but restarted 
these on day of discharge (had >24h with no melena or brbpr)

suspicion for infection or perforation given unremarkable CAT 
scan. 
- Continued standing acetaminophen 1g PO TID
- Oxycodone for mod to severe pain
- IV Dilaudid for breakthrough
- Continued Pregabalin 100 mg PO BID
