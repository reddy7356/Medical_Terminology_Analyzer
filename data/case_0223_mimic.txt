PATHOLOGY:
===================
___ Flex-Sig biopsy
Chronic mildly active colitis.
Note: No granulomata or dysplasia identified
 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ yo F with Crohn's, previously well maintained on mesalamine, 
who presented ___ with nausea, abdominal pain and bloody BM's.  
Admitted to Medicine for evaluation and management. Had elevated 
ESR/CRP and left-sided colitis seen on CT scan, overall c/w 
Crohn's disease with acute exacerbation.  C. difficile negative, 
so was started on IV Solumedrol per GI rec (___).  CRP 
responded accordingly, but continued to have severe cramping 
pain and bloody diarrhea when tried to eat.  Underwent flex-sig 
which did show active colitis, biopsy taken showing mild chronic 
active colitis.  Her Crohn's history is notable for extra-GI 
manifestations of arthropathy and scleritis.  She had previously 
been on Remicade, but this was stopped due to pulmonary side 
effects.  Hep B serologies suggest she is Hep B immune.  TPMT 
was WNL, Quant-Gold was NEGATIVE. Labs remained stable.  
Cortifoam was added for relief from tenesmus.  Pt. improved 
slowly and was able to advance to a low-residue diet.  However, 
she then decompensated, with worsening abdominal pain and bloody 
BM's.  She was ruled out for C. diff a ___ time and a CT was 
obtained, which ruled out abscess.  She was then started on IV 
cyclosporine infusion, and although feeling better on IV 
cyclosporine, her CRP continued to rise.  A CMV viral load was 
sent and was negative.  Colorectal Surgery was also consulted 
for possible colectomy.  She was maintained on heparin SQ for 
DVT prophylaxis for IBD flare. Flex sigmoidoscopy was repeated 
on ___ showing few punched out ulcers and findings consistent 
with colitis. Biopsy was taken with resultant CMV negative on 
immunostain.

Since patient was not improving with medical therapy alone, 
decision was made to intervene surgically. Patient was taken to 
the OR on ___ where she underwent laparoscopic converted to 
open total abdominal colectomy with end ileostomy. The procedure 
was converted to open due to a distended colon that made 
exposure difficult. 
Patient tolerated the procedure well. At the conclusion of the 
case, a Prevena vac was placed over the midline incision, 
surgical drain at the LLQ and a ___ drain in the rectum. 
After a brief and uneventful stay in the recovery room, patient 
was transferred to the surgical service for post-operative care.

Post-op, patient was kept NPO with IVF. Pain was controlled on 
PCA. Patient received IV hydrocortisone post-op, which was 
tapered in subsequent days. Diet was gradually advanced starting 
POD1, and patient was tolerating a regular diet on POD2. Both 
Foley catheter and rectal ___ drain were removed on POD2. 
Once tolerating oral intake, medications were transitioned to 
oral form. Pain regimen consistent of Dilaudid, Tylenol, and 
gabapentin. Patient was started on prophylactic Lovenox on POD3. 


Patient was discharged on POD7 to home with ___ services. At 
time of discharge, pain was well-controlled on oral medications. 
Patient was tolerating a regular diet, ambulating independently, 
voiding, and producing stool via the ostomy. She was discharged 
on prophylactic Lovenox. On day of discharge, prednisone had 
been tapered down to 5 mg, which was to be continued for another 
3 days after which dose would be decreased to 2.5 mg raily for 3 
days. Patient will follow up with Ostomy Nurse ___ 
___.

___ have a new ileostomy. The most common complication from a 
new ileostomy placement is dehydration. The output from the 
stoma is stool from the small intestine and the water content is 
very high. The stool is no longer passing through the large 
intestine which is where the water from the stool is reabsorbed 
into the body and the stool becomes formed. ___ must measure 
your ileostomy output for the next few weeks. The output from 
the stoma should not be more than 1200cc or less than 500cc. If 
___ find that your output has become too much or too little, 
please call the office for advice. The office nurse or nurse 
practitioner can recommend medications to increase or slow the 
ileostomy output. Keep yourself well hydrated, if ___ notice 
your ileostomy output increasing, take in more electrolyte drink 
such as Gatorade. Please monitor yourself for signs and symptoms 
of dehydration including: dizziness (especially upon standing), 
weakness, dry mouth, headache, or fatigue. If ___ notice these 
symptoms please call the office or return to the emergency room 
for evaluation if these symptoms are severe. ___ may eat a 
regular diet with your new ileostomy. However it is a good idea 
to avoid fatty or spicy foods and follow diet suggestions made 
to ___ by the ostomy nurses.

___ monitor the appearance of the ostomy and stoma and care 
for it as instructed by the wound/ostomy nurses. ___ stoma 
(intestine that protrudes outside of your abdomen) should be 
beefy red or pink, it may ooze small amounts of blood at times 
when touched and this should subside with time. The skin around 
the ostomy site should be kept clean and intact. Monitor the 
skin around the stoma for bulging or signs of infection listed 
above. Please care for the ostomy as ___ have been instructed by 
the wound/ostomy nurses. ___ will be able to make an appointment 
with the ostomy nurse in the clinic 7 days after surgery. ___

with staples. This incision is covered with a VAC dressing. When 
this is removed, it can be left open to air or covered with a 
dry sterile gauze dressing if the staples become irritated from 
clothing. The staples will stay in place until your first 
post-operative visit at which time they can be removed in the 
clinic, most likely by the office nurse. Please monitor the 
incision for signs and symptoms of infection including: 
increasing redness at the incision, opening of the incision, 
increased pain at the incision line, draining of 
white/green/yellow/foul smelling drainage, or if ___ develop a 
fever. Please call the office if ___ develop these symptoms or 
go to the emergency room if the symptoms are severe. ___ may 
shower, let the warm water run over the incision line and pat 
the area dry with a towel, do not rub.

seroma, however, 
superimposed infection is possible.  If desired, this collection 
is amenable 
to aspiration under ultrasound. 
2. Additional 3 cm thin rim-enhancing, hypodense collection in 
the central 
pelvis likely represents postoperative seroma and again 
superimposed infection 
is possible. 
3. Ileo-colonic anastomosis appears intact. 
4. Edema of the distal ileum is likely due to recent obstruction 
and surgery.

and passing of small amounts of dark, old appearing blood are 
expected however, if you notice that you are passing bright red 
blood with bowel your please seek medical attention. If you are 
passing loose stool without improvement please call the office

following symptoms please call the office or go to the emergency 
room if severe: increasing abdominal distension, increasing 
abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, inability to tolerate food or 
liquids, prolonged loose stool, or constipation.

You have a small wound where the old ileostomy once was. This 
should be covered with a dry sterile gauze dressing. The wound 
no longer requires packing with a gauze strip. Please monitor 
the incision for signs and symptoms of infection including: 
increasing redness at the incision, opening of the incision, 
increased pain at the incision line, draining of 
white/green/yellow/foul smelling drainage, or if you develop a 
fever. Please call the office if you develop these symptoms or 
go to the emergency room if the symptoms are severe. You may 
shower, let the warm water run over the wound line and pat the 
area dry with a towel, do not rub. Please apply a new gauze 
dressing after showering.
