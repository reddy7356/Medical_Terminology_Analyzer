Brief Hospital Course:
1. LEGAL & SAFETY:  
On admission, Ms. ___ signed a conditional voluntary 
agreement (Section 10 & 11) and that legal status remained in 
place throughout admission.  Ms. ___ was also placed on 15 
minute checks status on admission and remained on that level of 
observation throughout while being unit restricted.
 
2. PSYCHIATRIC:
#) Mood disorder NOS: pt has history of mood disorder that is 
diagnostically complicated by her substance use. She has a 
significant trauma history including an alleged sexual assault 
on an inpatient psych unit within the last year and likely has 
chronic complex PTSD in addition to mood disorder. Her 
medication regimen on admission was notable for polypharmacy 
with 3 anti-psychotics, (olanzapine, Saphris, Seroquel) that 
were consolidated to Seroquel alone. Adderall 40mg was 
discontinued with a great deal of protest and perseveration that 
gradually waned over several days. In addition, she displayed 
significant irritability, mood lability, and poor impulse 
control which improved somewhat over the hospital course. 
Cognitive exam was notable for poor calculations but ___ free 
recall over her insistence of being unable to remember 
"anything." As the day of discharge approached she escalated 
behaviors such as splitting and externalizing, and these 
borderline personality traits are likely contributing 
significantly to her current presentation. She also complained 
of severe leg pain that was worked up by medicine (see below.) 
Of note, following discharge she was seen standing comfortably 
beside a bench waiting for a cab. 

3. SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS:
#) Opioid Use Disorder-currently on suboxone treatment
Ms. ___ mood symptoms are significantly complicated by 
her substance use history, although she reports ___ year sobriety 
while on Suboxone. Ms. ___ was counseled regarding the 
negative effects of incorrect use of opioids upon 
mental/physical health and abstinence from opioids was 
encouraged.  She was provided resources to assist in maintaining 
abstinence upon discharge.

#) Tobacco Use Disorder: Ms. ___ was counseled regarding 
the negative effects of tobacco upon mental/physical health and 
abstinence from tobacco was encouraged. Nicotine patches were 
used for cravings while inpatient and she was provided a 
prescription for these patches following discharge.  She was 
provided resources to assist in maintaining abstinence upon 
discharge.

#) Marijuana Use: pt reports smoking most days for the purpose 
of helping with her appetite. Ms. ___ was counseled 
regarding the possible negative effects of marijuana on 
mental/physical health and abstinence from marijuana was 
encouraged. 

4. MEDICAL
Ms. ___ was medically cleared in the ED; no acute  medical 
issues prevented admission to Deac 4.  Additionally, Ms. 
___ has no chronic medical issues requiring attention. 

___ pain, Edema: pt complained of L leg pain and b/l edema. She
agreed to compression stockings and heat pack with gentle 
stretching. The day prior to discharge she was evaluated by 
Medicine who performed a thorough workup including RUQ US, CXR, 
CMP, CBC, BNP, and LENIs were ordered but refused by Ms. 
___. This workup revealed cirrhotic liver diagnosed by US 
which was determined to be the most likely precipitant of her 
persistently elevated LFTs, low platelet and WBC counts, and 
hypoalbuminemia. She may have venous stasis or mild lymphatic 
obstruction. She was recommended to maintain a ___ sodium diet, 
use compression stockings and elevation of feet, daily weights, 
and continue HCTZ. Lasix considered and not initiated due to 
concern for precipitating electrolyte abnormalities. CXR and BNP 
were largely WNL, ruling out heart failure. Other acute causes, 
(volume overload from cirrhotic disease, nephrotic syndrome, or 
myxedema,) were ruled out. These results were felt by the 
medicine team to be stable for follow-up on an outpatient basis 
and she has a new PCP intake scheduled for ___. 

# Hepatic cirrhosis: seen on RUQ u/s, in the setting of 
untreated HCV. This should be followed up by her outpatient 
doctor, would recommend referral to a hepatologist. Based on 
labs she is a Childs Class A with a MELD of 8. Patient should be 
monitored for signs and symptoms of cirrhotic decompensation 
such as encephalopathy, ascites,
and have an EGD to evaluate for varices. 
- continue lactulose as needed for constipation, although no
clear history of hepatic encephalopathy 
- outpatient follow up with consideration of referral to
hepatology for treatment of HCV and monitoring of cirrhosis 

# shortness of breath
# end expiratory wheezing: no evidence of pathology on chest 
x-ray. No evidence of ACS, heart failure, COPD exacerbation. 
Given her smoking history patient is at risk for COPD and OSA. 
- consider use of duonebs for symptoms if wheezing or shortness
of breath continues 
- Recommend outpatient sleep evaluation and PFTs 
- continue to encourage smoking cessation 

#HTN: BP in good control. Continued home regimen of 
Hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg PO/NG DAILY and Propranolol 20 mg 
PO/NG TID.

#Hypothyroidism: pt presented with undetectable TSH level 
indicating need to decrease current Levothyroxine dose from 
175mcg. Decreased to 100mcg, monitored for
symptoms. Rechecked revealed TSH still undetectable and FT4 1.2. 
This should be followed up after discharge in ___ weeks.

#GERD: pt endorsed abdominal discomfort and had mildly tender to 
palpation on admission in epigastric region.  Started Omeprazole 
20 mg PO DAILY and advised on nutrition to minimize symptoms.

5. PSYCHOSOCIAL
#) GROUPS/MILIEU:  
Ms. ___  was encouraged to participate in the various 
groups and milieu therapy opportunities offered by the unit.  
The occupational therapy and social work groups focus on 
teaching patients various coping skills. Ms. ___ 
occasionally attended these groups.  Ms. ___ was visible on 
the milieu and interacted with staff and peers, occasionally 
irritably.  

#) COLLATERAL CONTACTS & FAMILY INVOLVEMENT:
Ms. ___ gave verbal and written permission for the team to 
contact her outpatient psychiatrist, Dr. ___ outpatient 
case worker, ___.  Both were provided with a summary 
of Ms. ___ presentation to the ___ ED/Deac 4 and an 
update of her progress since admission on Deac 4, and they 
provided collateral information and treatment recommendations.

Ms. ___ did not consent to have her family contacted and 
they did not become involved with the team directly during this 
admission. 

6. INFORMED CONSENT: 
Medication: Seroquel (quetiapine)
---Intended effects/Benefits: treatment of thought disorder, 
mood stabilization, depression, anxiety
---Adverse effects/Risks: Drowsiness, nausea, akathisia, EPS, 
tremor, 
TD, QTc prolongation
Ms. ___ was informed of alternative treatments, the 
consequences of no treatment, and the expected duration of 
treatment. She appeared to appreciate the information conveyed 
in the consent process by asking appropriate questions, which 
were answered by the treatment team, and expressing 
understanding of the potential risks and benefits (see above).  
Prior to starting treatment, the team also discussed the 
patient's right to decide whether to take this medication as 
well as the importance of the patient's actively participating 
in the treatment.  Ms. ___ understood the above and 
consented to begin the medication.

7. RISK ASSESSMENT
On presentation, Ms. ___ was evaluated and felt to be at an 
increased risk of harm to herself due to her suicidal ideation.  
Ms. ___ static risk factors noted at that time include 
separated marital status, chronic mental illness, previous 
suicide attempt, acutely stressful events, and lack of social 
supports.  The modifiable risk factors identified were as such: 
homelessness, poor distress tolerance and coping skills, 
impulsive behavior, agitation, decreased self-esteem.  These 
modifiable risk factors were addressed with acute stabilization 
in a safe environment on a locked inpatient unit, 
psychopharmacologic adjustments, psychotherapeutic interventions 
(OT groups, SW groups, individual therapy meetings with 
psychiatrists), and presence on a social milieu environment.  
Ms. ___ is being discharged with many protective factors, 
including improved outpatient support, lack of suicidal 
ideation, help-seeking behavior, future-oriented viewpoint, 
improved coping skills.  Overall, based on the totality of our 
assessment at this time, Ms. ___ is not at an acutely 
elevated risk of harm to self nor danger to others. 

Our prognosis of this patient is guarded and would improve 
significantly if she engages in outpatient treatment.
