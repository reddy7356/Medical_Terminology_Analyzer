Ms. ___ was diagnosed at age ___.
An u/s on ___ showed an anteverted uterus at 8.7 x 3.9 x
5.1cm in size with 2 adjacent cysts measuring 11.8 x 4.5 x 4.9cm
with the largest cystic portion measuring 7.1 x 3.8cm in size. A
pelvic MRI in ___ showed an enlarged complex cystic mass
likely arising form the right ovary with 2 enlarged complex 
cysts
measuring 8.5cm and 6.3cm each. There was no other evidence of
metastatic disease.

She underwent surgery on ___. Intraoperative findings 
include
complex bilobed right ovarin mass filled with mucinous cystic
fluid which was ruptured intraoperatively. An attempt was made

well-differentiated
adenocarcinoma associated with a 7.5cm mucinous borderline 
tumor.
There was no LVSI, or malignancy noted from the
right fallopian tube. The cul-de-sac nodule was consistent with

Past Medical History:
PAST ONCOLOGIC HISTORY (per OMR):
Ms. ___ was diagnosed at age ___. An u/s on ___ showed an
anteverted uterus at 8.7 x 3.9 x 5.1cm in size with 2 adjacent
cysts measuring 11.8 x 4.5 x 4.9cm with the largest cystic
portion measuring 7.1 x 3.8cm in size. A pelvic MRI in ___

noted from the right fallopian tube. The cul-de-sac nodule was
consistent with metastatic mucinous carcinoma. Omental biopsy

Dear ___,

It was a pleasure caring for you at ___. You were admitted 
with an influenza-like illness but you were found to have 
negative flu swabs twice. You also had a CT of your chest which

cultures results thus far have been negative. Your symptoms are 
most consistent with a viral syndrome for which you did not need 
antibiotics. You recovered like a champ and will likely need 
another week or two before you start feeling back to your normal 
self. 

If you start to have fevers again or if your cough becomes 
worse, please let your oncologist know.
