Pertinent Results:
TEE ___:
Conclusions  
Pre CPB
The left atrium is moderately dilated. Left ventricular wall 
thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is 
normal. Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal. Overall 
left ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50-55%). 
[Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely more 
depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. 
The aortic valve leaflets are severely thickened/deformed. There 
is severe aortic valve stenosis (valve area <1.0cm2). Severe 
(4+) aortic regurgitation is seen. 
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is a 
minimally increased gradient consistent with trivial mitral 
stenosis. Moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen. 

Post CPB
The patient separated from bypass with a phenylephrine infusion.
A bioprothetic mitral valve is seen in anatomic position. The 
valve is well seated with no perivalvular leak. The gradient 
acros the valve is ___ mmHg.
A bioprothetic aortic valve is seen in anatomic position. The 
valve is well seated with no perivalvular leak. The residual 
mean gradient is 13 mmHg.
Biventricular function is well preserved. There is no sign of 
aortic injury or dissection. No other significant changes 
appreciated from prebypass exam.

 

CHEST CT W/O CONTRAST (___):
IMPRESSION:   
1.  Heavily calcified aortic valve, consistent with history of 
aortic 
stenosis. Normal caliber thoracic aorta with vascular 
calcifications as 
described above.  These images are available for review for 
preoperative 
planning.   
2. Nonspecific pleural and parenchymal scarring in the left 
lower lobe.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was brought to the Operating Room on ___ where 
the patient underwent Redo Sternotomy, Aortic valve replacement 
with a 21 mm Magna Ease ___ pericardial 
valve, Mitral valve replacement with a 27 mm Biocor Epic tissue 
valve, and Aortic root enlargement.  Overall the patient 
tolerated the procedure well and post-operatively was 
transferred to the CVICU in stable condition for recovery and 
invasive monitoring.  Additional left chest tube was placed for 
pneumothorax shortly after ICU arrival. 

POD 1 found the patient extubated, alert and oriented and 
breathing comfortably.  The patient was neurologically intact 
and hemodynamically stable, weaned from inotropic and 
vasopressor support.  Beta blocker was initiated and the patient 
was gently diuresed toward the preoperative weight.  The patient 
was transferred to the telemetry floor for further recovery.  

He started ilotycin ointment for eye pain that began after 
waking from anesthesia.  
He has had no vision deficits. Discomfort persisted and 
ophthalmology was consulted.  Lubricating eye drops are 
recommended.

Chest tube removal was delayed due to high output and recurring 
pneumothoraces during clamping trials.  His mediastinal chest 
tubes were removed without difficulty.  His left pleural was 
removed on POD 5 with small apical residual pneumothorax.  His 
right pleural tube was removed on POD 8. Follow-up CXRays 
revealed persistent hydro-pneumothorax.  Thoracic Surgery 
consulted and followed along.  Diuresis was increased and CXRays 
followed.  The patient will follow-up withi Thoracic Surgery in 
2 weeks. 

His temporary pacing wire removal was delayed until POD 4 due to 
postoperative thrombocytopenia (40K). His HITT result was 
negative, and platelets spontaneously improved.  He was seen by 
the Hematology team with suspected etiology of relation to 
bypass circuit, drug-induced immune thrombocytopenia (most 
likely due to cephalosporin antibiotic), possibly consumption by 
bleeding (although did not have massive bleeding) or some 
combination of all of the above.

He also developed post-operative AFib.  He did convert to SR 
prior to discharge.  He is rate controlled and will be 
discharged on Coumadin.  
He did have scant sternal drainage of the inferior pole.  WBC 
remained normal and he was afebrile.  He will be discharged with 
instructions to apply Chloraprep BID.  He will return for a 
wound check later this week.  Additionally, the left chest tube 
site continues to drain serous fluid.  The patient will 
reinforce dressings prn. 

The patient was evaluated by the physical therapy service for 
assistance with strength and mobility.  By the time of discharge 
on POD 11 the patient was ambulating freely, the wound was 
healing and pain was controlled with oral analgesics.  The 
patient was discharged home in good condition with appropriate 
follow up instructions.  Cardiac Surgery will follow 
anti-coagulation for the remainder of the week and Dr. ___ 
will assume management next ___.
