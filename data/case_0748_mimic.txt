History of Present Illness:
Ms. ___ is a ___ year old woman with history of depression who 
presented after a Seroquel (quetiapine) overdose. She was last 
seen well at about 8:30 pm on ___, had a normal conversation 
with her daughter before the daughter went to bed. At 10 pm the 
daughter heard stumbling, and the patient was holding onto the 
doorway, asked the daughter to call ___. The patient has been 
stressed out at work, is a ___ at ___ and had 
negative interactions with her boss. She took all of the pills 
of Seroquel that she had (found with 2 empty bottles of 
Seroquel, 100 mg tablets, 30 tablet fills, but unknown how much
was actually in each bottle). EMS arrived and patient was noted 
to have pinpoint pupils and BP 91/61 and heart rate of 130. EMS 
started IVF. She was given Narcan 2 mg without improvement in 
miosis. Initially she was confused, but became more unresponsive 
en route to the ED.

In the ED she was noted to have ronchorous breath sounds and 
copious secretions in mouth. She became apneic and was intubated 
(given etomidate and rocuronium). Sedated with fentanyl and 
midazolam. After intubation her HR was in the 160s and was in 
sustained SVT, so she was given 6 mg adenosine. ET tube was deep
on CXR, so was pulled back 3 cm. Toxicologist recommended 
supportive care with q1h EKG for QTc monitoring. Did not 
recommend bicarbonate as there were not QRS changes.

In the ED,  
- Initial Vitals:  
T 96.4, HR 134, BP 80/50, RR 14, 98% 4L NC 

- Exam:  
-Pinpoint pupils
-Regular respiration
-Secretions pooling in the airway

- Labs:  
VBG 7.31/52 -> 7.32/44

Utox negative
Serum TCA positive
Serum ASA, acetaminophen, EtOH negative

- Imaging:  
CXR  
1. ET tube closely approximates the right mainstem bronchus and 
should be 
retracted by 2-3 cm for appropriate positioning.  2. Mild 
pulmonary vascular congestion without overt edema. 

- Consults:  Toxicology, Respiratory therapy

- Interventions: In the ED the patient was intubated for airway 
protection. She received etomidate and rocuronium for 
intubation, sedated with fentanyl and midazolam. Received 1L LR.

 
Past Medical History:

IMAGING/REPORTS
===============
___ CXR: 
Endotracheal tube closely approximate the right mainstem 
bronchus.  An enteric tube is seen coursing below the left 
hemidiaphragm with the side port projecting in the expected 
location of the stomach.  Lung volumes are low.  No focal 
consolidation is seen.  No large pleural effusion or 
pneumothorax.  Mild pulmonary vascular congestion without overt 
edema. 
  
IMPRESSION: 
1. ET tube closely approximates the right mainstem bronchus and 
should be 
retracted by 2-3 cm for appropriate positioning. 
2. Mild pulmonary vascular congestion without overt edema. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
SUMMARY
=======
___ is a ___ year old woman with history who presented 
after an intentional quetiapine overdose, intubated for airway 
protection. She was weaned off sedation and extubated and her 
mental status continued to improve over time. She was monitored 
with serial EKGs and on telemetry and did not require any 
bicarbonate or other interventions. Her course was complicated 
by sinus tachycardia thought to be due to a combination of 
anticholerngic effects from quetiapine and dehydration from 
reduced PO intake. This had fully resolved prior to discharge to 
inpatient psychiatric unit. 

#Intentional Quetiapine overdose
#Depression
#Altered Mental Status
Presented after intentional overdose, suicide note found by 
daughter in the home, ___ attempt. Evaluated by toxicology who 
recommended supportive care and QTc monitoring. No indication 
for bicarbonate as she did not have QRS changes. QTc prolonged 
to as high as 581. QTc at the time of discharge was 420. 

#Sinus Tachycardia: 
Likely secondary to queitapine overdose although persistent as 
mental status improves. Likely also a component of hypovolemia 
given decreased intake due to mental status. She was maintained 
on a regular diet and we encouraged PO intake. Stable in high 
___ 100s at time of discharge. 

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES
===================
[] Please arrange PCP follow up upon discharge from inpatient 
psychiatry unit.
