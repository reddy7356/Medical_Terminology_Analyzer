Imaging:

CXR ___: IMPRESSION: Mild bibasilar opacity in the setting 
of low lung volumes could represent small effusion or 
atelectasis. Limited due to rotation.  No significant change 
from prior. 
 
ECHO ___: The left atrium is elongated. There is mild 
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular 
cavity is moderately dilated. There is severe global left 
ventricular hypokinesis, with the lateral wall having relatively 
better wall motion compared to the remainder of the ventricle 
(LVEF = ___ %). The estimated cardiac index is depressed 
(<2.0L/min/m2). No masses or thrombi are seen in the left 
ventricle. Right ventricular chamber size is top-normal with 
moderate global free wall hypokinesis. The aortic valve leaflets 
are moderately thickened. There is no aortic valve stenosis. 
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets 
are mildly thickened. Mild to moderate (___) mitral 
regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity 
of mitral regurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated.] 
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is 
moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no 
pericardial effusion. IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left 
ventricular hypertrophy with a dilated cavity. Severe global LV 
hypokinesis. Moderate right ventricular free wall hypokinesis. 
Mild to moderate mitral regurgitation. Moderate pulmonary 
hypertension.  

EKG ___:
Atrial fibrillation. Right bundle-branch block. Left anterior 
hemiblock. 
T wave inversion across the precordium. This tracing has no 
small R wave  
in lead V3 which was present on the previous tracing. This may 
be due to 
lead placement. Markedly wide QRS complex suggests additional 
disease such as left ventericular hypertrophy.

Brief Hospital Course:
___ with poor prior medical care who presented with atrial 
fibrillation and NSVT. She was found to have acute decompensated 
heart failure, complicated by intra-abdominal mass concerning 
for malignancy.
.
# Acute decompensated systolic heart failure: The patient's EF 
was found to be ___ on echo. BNP was markedly elevated at 
OSH. Exam and CXR were consistent with significant fluid 
overload. The chronicity of this was unclear, but given 
appearance of EKG, symptom presentation, only mild troponinemia, 
and poor preventative care, higher suspicion for past acute 
coronary events contributing to her heart failure, now with 
acute decompensation and volume overload than current ACS. She 
was treated with carvedilol 6.25mg BID, prn hydralazine, 
amiodarone for afib (see below). ACE-I was initially held given 
___, and was started once her renal function improved. Pt also 
started on 20 PO daily lasix and uptitrated to 40 PO daily.
. 
# Altered Mental Status: Per daughter, patient’s mental status 
had decompensated over the past several days prior to admission. 
Before that, she was independent, able to drive and cook for 
herself. Etiologies considered were: infectious vs.  
toxic-metabolic encephalopathy from ___ or liver failure, 
and severe decompensated CHF. Her mental status improved with 
treatment of her numerous medical problems, as well as 
initiation of IV acyclovir for possible zoster / encephalopathy. 
LP performed ___ showed no leukocytosis, gram stain showed no 
organisms, and her HSV / VZV PCR showed no evidence of HSV or 
VZV CNS infecion. At the time of discharge, her mental status 
had improved significantly and acyclovir was disconinued after 
negative PCR findings.
.
# New AFib: she was found to have atrial fibrillation with RVR 
on this admission, without prior documented history of Afib. She 
was started on amiodarone 200 mg PO TID (started ___ with 
goal to complete an 8g load; dosing set to end course on 
___, Carvedilol 6.25 mg PO/NG BID, and heparin bridge to 
coumadin. 
.
# Congestive hepatopathy: She presented with transaminitis and 
elevated INR, likely congestive hepatopathy from acute CHF. 
However CT at ___ commented on lobulated/possible cirrhosis 
appearance of liver. There were no physical stigmata of chronic 
liver disease. Her LFTs improved with treatment of her CHF.
.
# V3/C3 Zoster: she presented with a rash on her right face in 
V3 and C3 distribution. Per Derm, appears like Zoster. She was 
treated with Acyclovir IV (given possible encephalopathy) d1 = 
___, and LP was performed, which showed __. Skin scrapings neg 
for HSV or VZV.
.
# Acute kidney injury: Unknown baseline Cr. Likely pre-renal in 
the setting of poor PO intake, intravascular depletion, poor 
forward flow vs ATN from hypoperfusion. Also on acyclovir. Her 
renal function improved with treatment of her CHF. ACE-I was 
held in the setting ___ and ___ started. Cr peaked at 2 and 
improved slightly with discharge Cr of 1.7.
.
# CAD: Patient presented with Trop 0.04 on admission, with new 
afib / monomorphic VT / new LBBB on EKG, and severely depressed 
EF on bedside echo. Possibly had NSTEMI in the setting of her 
atypical symptoms ~1 week prior to admission, mildly elevated 
troponin, and arrythmias including monomorphic VT. However EKG 
and report from ___ show VT only lasted ___ beats, and 
therefore may be NSVT. Given severely depressed EF, this is 
probably not a new MI but she likely had recurrent ACS in past. 
Troponinemia probably enzyme leak in setting of CHF. As 
presentation less concerning for ACS. She was initially treated 
with heparin gtt, plavix, and atorvastatin, however these were 
discontinued given low likelyhood of ACS. She was continued on 
aspirin 81mg daily and carvedilol 6.25mg BID.
.
# RLE Stasis Dermatitis vs cellulitis: Exam concerning for 
cellulitis with central ulcer vs. stasis dermatitis from edema. 
Dermatology initial impression was that this was more consistent 
with stasis dermatitis, however pt had persistent leukocytosis 
and open lesion on the right leg concerning for cellulitis. She 
was treated initially with a dose of vancomycin on ___, was 
transition to doxycycline + keflex on ___, with total 7 day 
course of antibiotics until ___.
.
# Arrythmia: Patient with runs of NSVT ___s 
atrial fibrillation with LBBB, frequent PVCs. Arrythmias likely 
increased in setting of heart failure decompensation. 
Monomorhpic nature of VT and presence of Q waves indicated 
infarction/scar as source of arrhythmia, most likely from past 
MI (s). Therefore, patient likel had CHF with structural heart 
disease and NSVT, accounting for the symptoms. Patient was 
amiodarone loaded for treatment of VT.
.
# Leukocytosis: Infectious possibilities include cellulitis and 
there was initially concern for Zoster. Patient was afebrile. 
Patient had recent dyspnea, thought to be primarily from her 
CHF, and denies fevers/chills/other localizing signs of 
infection.  Also consideration for aspiration pneumonitis, as 
patient is naive to PO medications and noted to have some 
difficulty with pills by CCU nurse.
.
# Uterine mass: She was found to have a large abdominal mass on 
exam, with CT from ___ showed a 23.4 x 17.3 x 20.7 cm 
calcific and septating mass concern for malignancy, as well as 
right ovarian cystic lesion measuring 5.8 x 4.7 x 3.8 cm. Her 
CA125 was elevated (nonspecific), however ___ and CEA were 
normal. OB/GYN was consulted and discussed treatment options 
with the patient, who ultimately declined surgical intervention. 
GYN offered OP f/u to further discuss mgmt options with the pt.
.
# Hyperglycemia: A1C 6.3. She was treated with HISS while 
inpatient.
.

Discharge Instructions:
It was a pleasure taking care of you at ___. 
You were admitted with congestive heart failure, atrial 
fibrillation, and dermatitis of your right leg. You received 
diuretics to remove the extra fluid and your weight at discharge 
is 156 pounds. Congestive heart failure means that your heart is 
weak, which causes fluid to collect in your lungs and in your 
legs. We have given you medication to help clear this excess 
fluid, and you will continue to take this medication every day. 
This medication will make you urinate frequently, and can also 
cause electrolyte imbalances. You will need to have your labs 
checked in a few days after discharge. With heart failure, it is 
very important to weigh yourself every day, as this is a good 
way to keep track of how much extra fluid is in your body. Weigh 
yourself every day, at the same time of day, and call Dr. 
___ your weight goes up by three pounds in one day or 
five pounds in three days. 

Atrial fibrillation is an irregular, sometimes fast heart 
rhythm. We have started medications to help control your heart 
rate. The risk of blood clots that cause stroke is significantly 
increased with atrial fibrillation, so you must take medication 
to prevent blood clots. It is important that you take this 
medication every day as ordered. This medication can increase 
your risk for bleeding, so it is very important to have your 
levels checked on a routine basis. 

You had a dermatitis on your right leg, which is a form of skin 
inflammation. You were treated with antibiotics while in the 
hospital, as well as cream to help control the inflammation. 

You had a rash on your face that may have been caused by 
shingles, and was treated with an antiviral medication. 

You have a large mass in your belly. It is unclear whether this 
is cancer, or some other condition. The gynecologic surgery 
doctors met with ___ while you were in the hospital, and an 
appointment has been scheduled for you after discharge to 
discuss diagnosis and treatment options. 
 
Followup Instructions:
___
