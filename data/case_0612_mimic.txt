Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,  

It was a pleasure taking care of you at the ___ 
___. 
 
WHY WAS I IN THE HOSPITAL?  
==========================  
- You were transferred to this hospital with a heart attack. We 
adjusted your medicines to help your heart recover from the 
heart attack. We found that you have blood pressure that drops 
severely when you stand up. We stopped medicines that could 
cause this and allowed your blood pressure to be higher overall. 


WHAT HAPPENED IN THE HOSPITAL?  
==============================  
 - You had a heart catheterization and found to have mild 
disease in left anterior descending (LAD) artery. You did not 
need any intervention. It is possible that the blood work showed 
possibility of heart attack was caused by your rapid atrial 
fibrillation with higher rates causing high demands on your 
heart.
 - You were seen by a psychiatrist  who deemed you ready to go 
home.
 - Your blood pressure was low, especially when standing up, so 
your blood pressure medicines were stopped. 
 - You were evaluated by physical therapy and you should get 
physical therapy at home. 
 
WHAT SHOULD I DO WHEN I LEAVE THE HOSPITAL?
===========================================  
- Take all of your medications as prescribed with changes as 
noted in  your discharge medicine list. 
- Please weigh yourself daily. If your weight goes up by ___ 
lbs. in three days, or if you develop increased swelling in your 
legs, abdomen, or become short of breath or have trouble 
breathing; please call your cardiologist to evaluate if you may 
need the Lasix resumed.
 
-Change your Ativan dose to: 1mg daily at bedtime and 0.5mg as 
needed for anxiety up to two times daily.

- Follow up with your doctors as listed below 
 
It was a pleasure participating in your care.  

If you have any urgent questions that are related to your 
recovery from your hospitalization or are experiencing any 
symptoms that are concerning to you and you think you may need 
to return to the hospital, please call the ___ HeartLine at 
___ to speak to a cardiologist or cardiac nurse 
practitioner.  

-Your ___ Care Team
