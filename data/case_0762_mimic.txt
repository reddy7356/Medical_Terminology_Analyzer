Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ is a ___ F with a hx of atrial fibrillation, 
tachy-brady syndrome, CHF with EF 30%, DM who presented with 
atrial fibrillation and CHF.  
.  
#. Afib RVR: Shortness of breath on admission likey secondary to 
Afib with RVR. She was comfortable after 60mg IV Lasix at the 
OSH. Unclear precipitant to her afib with RVR; however she has a 
history of symptomatic dizziness with afib. Rate initially 
controlled on diltiazem gtt, then successfully transitioned to 
PO metoprolol only prior to her procedure. She ultimately had an 
AVJ ablation and pacer placement. It was only possible to place 
single lead, so she is still in atrial fibrillation and V paced 
at 80. She reported a history of rash with Coumadin and 
Aggatroban, and therefore was not anticoagulated prior to 
admission. However, upon further questioning, patient stated she 
has not had allergic reaction to warfarin, only to brand name, 
coumadin. Prior to procedure she was anticoagulated on heparin. 
She was then started on warfarin (given CHADS2 of 6) without any 
complications. She received 10mg on first night, then 7.5mg. She 
was discharged on 5mg daily. She will have her INR followed by 
her PCP, ___.  She was also instructed to continue her 
keflex for a total 3 day course. She will have a pacer 
interrogation next week.

#. Acute on chronic Systolic congestive heart failure, EF 30%: 
There was likely some component of CHF to Ms. ___ 
presentation, given her physical exam and good response to 
lasix. Her outpatient lasix was increased from 20mg daily to 
40mg daily. In addition, toprol XL was increased from 50mg to 
100mg. She was continued on ACEi. She was continued on statin, 
niacin, ASA. She will f/u with Dr. ___ as outpatient.

2. s/p transient ischemic attack
3. Dyslipidemia
4. Hypertension

 
Discharge Condition:

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted to ___ on ___ because of your atrial 
fibrillation (abnormal heart rhythm). We did a procedure to burn 
out the area that conducts the abnormal rhythm, and placed a 
pacer as well. Your symptoms improved markedly by the time of 
discharge. You were started on warfarin to prevent strokes from 
blood clots that could form in your heart. You should take this 
medicine everyday. You will need to have your INR checked on 
___. This is a blood test to check the level of 
blood thinner. You will have this checked at Dr. ___, 
and Dr. ___ is aware.

Your medication changes are as follows:
-START taking warfarin daily. 
-CHANGE from metoprolol XL 50mg a day to metoprolol XL 100mg a 
day.
-INCREASE your lasix from 20mg a day to 40mg a day.
-CONTINUE taking keflex (antibiotic) until ___.

Because you have a diagnosis of congestive heart failure, you 
should do the following:
Weigh yourself every morning, call MD if weight goes up more 
than 3 lbs in 3 day.
Adhere to 2 gm sodium diet
Fluid Restriction: 2 liters.

Please return to the ER or call your doctor if you develop chest 
pain, shortness of breath, new rash/sensation that your throat

CAD as an etiology of her cardiomyopathy for long-term, but 
agreed to it at ___.  ___ @ ___ revealed essentially normal 
coronary arteries.  She had recently stopped digoxin due to 
symptomatic bradycardia.  Additionally, she felt that a recent 
pharmacy change had caused her to feel unwell with taking 
lisinopril, so she discontiuned it.  CTA did not show any 
evidence of PE/PNA with some cardiomegaly.  She reported some

Brief Hospital Course:
# DCM - EF 30% by TTE ___.  Per recs, patient is not a good 
candidate for BiV pacer, as her QRS < 100 msec and therefore 
shows little evidence of dyssynchrony.  No evidence of volume 
overload or other heart failure symptoms at this time.
- Continued BB, lasix.  Restarted patient on lisinopril as she 
does not list a true allergic reaction / idiosyncratic reaction 
to the medication.  Instructed patient to stop medication if she 
does have a reaction to the medication.
- Patient was switched from atenolol to metoprolol succinate as 
this has a better indication for heart failure.
.
# AF/tachybrady - Patient is currently in AF with HR ranging 
from ___ - 120s.  Given her tachy/brady syndrome and impaired 
EF, may be of benefit to place ICD/pacer eventually.  After 
discussion with Dr. ___ was felt that first an EP study 
for possible ablation would be tried as outpatient.
- Follow up with ___ clinic for ablation study next week.
.
# MR - Per CTS, patient is not a good surgical candidate for MVR 
at this time.  TTE ___ only showed moderate MR.
.
# DM2 - SSI.
# HLP - Continue statin.

Discharge Instructions:
You were seen at ___ for evaluation of mitral valve 
replacement and/or implantable cardioverter/defibrillator 
placement.  After discussion with our cardiothoracic surgeons, 
it was felt that you should not receive mitral valve replacement 
at this time.

Additionally, we felt that there was no need to place a ICD at 
this time, but that you could benefit from an ablation study, 
which examines the conduction circuits in your heart and 
potentially removes abnormal ones.  Dr. ___ cardiac 
electrophysiologist, will contact you in the near future to 
schedule this procedure.

The following medications were changed:
DISCONTINUED atenolol
ADDED metoprolol succinate, as this is a better medication for 
heart failure
ADDED lisinopril, as this is an important medication for heart 
failure

If you experience palpitations, dizziness, chest pain, shortness 
of breath, or any other worrisome symptoms, please contact your 
PCP or go to the Emergency Department.
