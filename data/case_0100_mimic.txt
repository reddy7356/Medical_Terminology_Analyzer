In the ED, initial VS were 98.1, 66, 193/119, 14, 99% RA. She

She had been off all blood pressure medication for the past year

on HCTZ 25 and Lisinopril 10 which were her previous 
medications.  She got her first dose at midnight and her BP was 
low 96/40 the following morning at 9am.  She received 500ml 
bolus of IVF and SBP was back up to 130s.  She was discharged on 
HCTZ 25mg po and close outpatient follow up.  She was counselled 
on the importance of taking her medication and agreed that she 
needs them.  We also noted that her potassium is chronically low 
and her bicarb is chronically high and suggested outpatient work 
up of renin-angiotenson-aldosterone axis.

# Headache: Likely tension headache and worsened by high blood 
pressure but no other neuro symptoms concerning for hypertensive 
urgency. CT head was negative.  Patient was given tylenol and
