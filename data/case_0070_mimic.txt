Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ is a ___ year old woman with poorly controlled type 
1 DM presenting with hyperglycemia, recently diagnosed UTI, and 
mucocutaneous candidal infections with nausea, vomiting, and 
hyperglycemia. 

#UTI: Recently diagnosed and started on ciprofloxacin on ___ at 
urgent care. In ED, UA positive for leukocytes and bacteria. 
Urine cultures were drawn and are pending at discharge. Urine 
culture from urgent care visit last week grew multiple organisms 
but sensitivities were not performed. She was started on IV 
ceftriaxone on ___ and was transitioned to nitrofurantoin 100mg 
twice a day from ___ until ___ for a total of 5 day course of 
antibiotics. 

#Type I diabetes, hyperglycemia: Patient presented with blood 
glucoses in the 300s and fingersticks remained high likely in 
setting of infection. UA negative for ketones, so unlikely DKA. 
___ was consulted and recommended continuing glargine 28u 
twice a day, humalog after each meal with carbohydrate count 
scale, and follow up with Dr. ___ in one week. 

#Chronic kidney disease with acute kidney injury: Creatinine was 
elevated to 1.5 from baseline of 1.2-1.3. Most likely pre-renal 
in setting of poor PO intake. 

#Oral thrush and candidal vaginitis: Thrush on oral and pelvic 
exam and patient reports dysphagia but no odynophagia. She was 
started on nystatin swish and swallow. For candidal vaginitis, 
she should continue taking fluconazole 150mg daily for one week. 


===========================
Transitional Care Issues:
- Creatinine was elevated at admission, please check a follow up 
creatinine in a few days to evaluate resolution.
- Home furosemide and valsartan were held due to elevated 
creatinine. Her blood pressures were well controlled during 
admission off the medications. Please check blood pressure and 
restart medications as needed when elevated creatinine resolves.
- Patient reports oral thrush and ___ vaginitis symptoms for 
about 9 months, the fluconazole should be sufficient to treat 
the thrush, but she may need longer course if this is a 
recurrent infection or if she continues to require antibiotic 
treatment for other infections.

IMAGING:
========
Abd US (___):
IMPRESSION: 
1.  Redemonstration of two stable small hepatic lesions, the 
larger of which was previously characterized by MRI as a 
probable adenoma.
2.  Otherwise unremarkable abdominal ultrasound without finding 
to account for the patient's symptoms.

GASTRIC EMPTYING STUDY (___):
IMPRESSION: 
Delayed gastric emptying, with 71% of the ingested activity 
remaining in the stomach.

MRCP (___):
IMPRESSION:
1. No cause for patient's persistent nausea and vomiting 
identified.
2. Stable arterially hyperenhancing hepatic lesions in segments 
___ and
segment 2, likely in keeping with adenomas. No new hepatic 
lesions
identified.
3. No cholelithiasis or choledocholithiasis. Normal caliber main 
pancreatic
duct, CBD and intrahepatic bile ducts.
4. 2.5 cm left adnexal cyst.

 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ y/o F PMH of DM1 complicated by gastroparesis, retinopathy, 
and CKD, and anxiety here for complaints of nausea/vomiting that 
has been ongoing for the past few months c/w prior 
gastroparesis. 

ACTIVE ISSUES:
==============
# Gastroparesis
Sent in by ___ GI given significant sx for past few months 
with evidence of dehydration. Pt improved on admission with 
initiation of reglan and IVF. While here GI evaluated patient 
with repeat gastric emptying study performed while off of reglan 
in order to confirm diagnosis of gastroparesis as prior studies 
had been negative. Repeat gastric emptying study confirmed 
diagnosis with plan for pt to continue her prior regiment for 
gastroparesis except holding the motilium and utilizing reglan 
in the interim given improvement seen while on reglan. Further 
discussion for treatment to be discussed with ___ 
gastroenterologist for long term control. Pt warned of black box 
warnings regarding movement disorders associated with use of 
reglan which pt verbalized understanding of risks/benefits. Pt 
further instructed on non-pharmacologic measures including diet 
modifications such as small, low fat, low lactose meals. Abd US 
was also performed that was otherwise unremarkable to explain 
etiology of mild abd discomfort with MRCP showing no significant 
obstruction with stable liver findings. No findings to explain 
nausea or pain pt had presented with. On day of discharge, 
patient was symptomatically improved and able to tolerate PO 
intake. Outpatient gastroenterologist aware of work-up performed 
with close follow-up planned to be arranged for consideration of 
further management and diagnostics.

# ___ on CKD
Baseline Cr ~1.1-1.3. On presentation 1.4, likely secondary to 
significant dehydration from low PO input. Improved s/p IV and 
PO fluids. Recommended continued ___ follow-up for CKD with 
consideration of diuretic dose adjustment as needed given pt's 
intermittent episodes of dehydration from poor PO.

CHRONIC ISSUES:
===============
# DM1
Longstanding history w/ complications. Last A1c per ___ in 
~8%. While here, was followed by ___ who assisted in dose 
adjustments for pt.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
====================
- Ensure f/u with ___ GI with f/u on studies pending
- GI to consider additional evaluation including EGD or HIDA 
scan
- Continue long term management of gastroparesis for symptomatic 
relief
- Continue close follow-up with ___ for improved DM control
- Continue to monitor for dehydration, encourage PO intake, 
consider titration of diuretics as needed to avoid exacerbation 
of dehydration
- F/u on incidental adrenal cyst seen on 2.5 cm left adnexal 
cyst

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,

You were admitted to the hospital for nausea leading to 
dehydration. The cause of your symptoms was found to be due to 
your gastroparesis that was confirmed with repeat studies. You 
improved while you were here with medications and IV fluids.

You were seen by our gastroenterologists here who recommended 
that you follow-up with your outpatient gastroenterologist 1 
week after leaving the hospital. They will adjust your 
medications as needed and may perform additional studies as an 
outpatient.

Please continue your medications as previously prescribed 
including your insulin regiment by ___. You can take reglan 
(metoclopramide) as needed to help with your symptoms but should 
be aware of the warnings regarding its potential adverse effects 
on movements as discussed with you. Please avoid taking your 
motilium at this time since it may interact with reglan. Make 
sure to also eat small, low fat, lactose free meals to minimize 
your symptoms. Be sure to stay well-hydrated.

Continue to follow-up with your primary care physician and 
nephrologist for your other medical problems.

Take care.

History of Present Illness:
Ms. ___ is a ___ old woman with history IDDM on insulin 
pump, HTN, CKD, recurrent UTI's who presented to ED w/one month 
of malaise and elevated blood glucose. 

Patient has been seen multiple times in ED as of late, most 
recently for chest pain and SOB on ___ at which time CTA was 
negative for PE and work up was negative for cardiac or 
infectious source of her symptoms. Prior to that she was seen 
for cough, dyspnea and diagnosed with pneumonia. Per the patient 
she completed two separate course of antibiotics and a course of 
antiviral treatment. Today patient reports she has continued to 
feel unwell since completing her treatment for pneumonia. She 
has also been experiencing elevated blood sugars, despite 
increasing her insulin basal rate/boluses on her insulin pump. 
In addition she reports 3 days of LLQ pain and small amounts of 
vaginal discharge. Endorses intermittent L sided chest and 
should pain, identical to pain she was worked up for on ___ 
w/negative CTA.  

Of note, patient has very long, complicated history of 
leukocytosis, elevated inflammatory markers and somatic 
complaints for which she has been seen by rheumatology and 
infectious disease. She has been evaluated for vasculitis, 
connective tissue disease, autoimmune disorders and persistent 
infection, all of which has been negative.  
 
In the ED, initial vitals: 99.7 105 137/73 20 99% RA. Pelvic 
exam performed which revealed white curdish discharge consistent 
with candidiasis. Labs notable for WBC 12.8 (baseline), Hb 10.6 
(baseline), Cr 1.6 (b/l 1.2-1.4), Lactate 2.5, AST/AP mildly 
elevated at 41 and 130 respectively. UA negative, urine HCG 
negative, Flu A/B negative. EKG NSR rate 102, no ST changed. CXR 
revealed subtly opacity in L lower lung, most likely 
atelectasis, but unable to exclude early PNA. CT A/P (prelim 
read) showed "mild fullness of the right ureter without definite 
obstructive stone. Appendix is not visualized but there are no 
secondary signs of inflammation the right lower quadrant".  
 
 Patient was given IVF, fluconazole 150mg, IV morphine, 
Gabapentin and was admitted to medicine for further management. 
Vitals prior to transfer: 98.6 92 113/63 18 97% RA  
 
 On the floor, patient reports intermittent sharp chest pain, 
back pain and ROS is universally positive for fevers (to 99.9 at 
home, but patient says this is fever for her), cough, nausea, 
vomiting, dysuria and one episode of diarrhea. Also emphasizes 
that her blood sugars have been completely out of control at 
home, up to 600. She is certain she has an infection and is 
anxious to figure out what is going on.
