Brief Hospital Course:
___ woman with PMH of HTN, Breast CA s/p surgery and 
chemoXRT in remission  who presents with one day of nausea, 
vomiting, and rightsided abdominal pain. RUQ u/s was reassuring 
and CT abdomen raised concern for enteritis vs partial SBO.
Pt was seen by surgery who was reassured by her exam. Pt was 
advanced a liquid diet overnight and had multiple BMs.  On ___, 
pt was denying pain and felt ready to advance a regular diet.  
Pt did well with the regular diet, denied any recurrent of abd 
pain or N/V though she had some epigastric fullness after eating 
that has been present for some years now.  I spoke at length 
with patient/family who report previous similar episodes of abd 
pain that resolves rapidly which has been worked up at ___ with 
a possible diagnosis of gastroparesis.  I explained that this 
episode may have been due to a partial SBO from intra-abdominal 
scaring which may be contributing to these intermittent events.  
 Pt wanted a referral to GI here at ___ and I agreed to help 
coordinate.   I will contact her son on ___ when the 
clinics are open to check in on her symptoms and provide 
appointment information to them.   Pt was discharged home to her 
family on the evening of ___ tolerating a regular diet without 
any abd pain, N/V.
