Brief Hospital Course:
Neurology/oncology - Exam findings consistent with cauda equina 
syndrome.  We obtained 3 lumbar punctures for cytology.  Results 
signifiant for WBCs ___, RBCs 16 to 415 with clearing from 
tubes 1 -->4 each time, protein 259-348, glucose 52-65.  
Cytology negative on the first, a few atypical cells which were 
not conclusive on the ___ and positive on the ___ with cells 
consistent with breast cancer.  ER and HER2 markers on cells 
from ___ recommended by medical oncology, unable to be done 
because not enough cells in CSF.  Slides and tissue block from 
her primary breast cancer in ___ obtained for 
cytology/pathology to compare cells found in CSF.  Cytology 
thought that the cells looked the same as cells from her old 
tissue block.  CSF LDH 98, CEA <1.  Serum showed elevated 
___ at 46, serum CEA <1.  

Also serum CRP 7.3.  Hemoglobin A1c and TSH within normal 
limits.  

MRI imaging of the brain and the entire spine:  Enhancement of 
the cauda equina with an enhancing soft tissue mass in the 
distal thecal sac. Focal signal abnormality and enhancement 
within the thoracic spinal cord extending from T3-4 to T5-6 
level. 

Imaging findings and cytology confirm the diagnosis of 
leptomeningeal carcinomatosis, most likely metastatic breast 
cancer. 

CT torso and bone scan negative for evidence of metastatic 
disease elsewhere. 

Neuro-oncology (___) consulted and met with the patient, 
see his note for details.  He agreed with diagnosis of 
leptomeningeal carcinomatosis and recommended starting right 
away with radiation therapy, likely followed by chemotherapy.  
Medical oncology also saw the patient, recommended sending the 
tumor markers as above, agreed with diagnosis.  

Discussed with both teams regarding the need to try to obtain a 
biopsy potentially of the mass in the distal thecal sac prior to 
treatment, but it would not have be possible to obtain without 
laminectomy which would have delayed radiation.  Also concerns 
for poor wound healing with radiation after surgery.  Given high 
level of clinical suspicion for metastatic breast cancer and 
also as in the end cells were obtained from CSF, biopsy was not 
necessary.   

Neurologic exam on discharge significant for weakness in the 
hamstrings, hip abduction, ankle dorsiflexion and 
plantarflexion, and toe extension and flexion bilaterally. 
Numbness in a S1-4 distribution.

admission.  Valium 5mg po Q6hrs prn.  

ID: CSF lyme ___ and CSF HSV PCR negative.  CSF CMV and VZV 
PCRs pending on discharge, however symptoms explained by 
diagnosis as above.  

CV/Resp:  Persistent mild tachycardia ___ during admission, 
sinus rhythm.  Normla EKG.  BPs within normal limits.  No 
desaturations.

colace, miralax prn and senna prn.
