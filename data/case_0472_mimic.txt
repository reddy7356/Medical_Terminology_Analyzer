History of Present Illness:
___ is a ___ old woman with a history of atrial
fibrillation on apixaban, HTN, depression, and dysphagia,
presenting  after an episode of choking sensation.

Last fall, the patient had an episode of choking on a cracker
requiring the Heimlich maneuver. Since that time, she has been
seen by multiple providers for choking sensation, dysphagia, and
hoarseness. Her evaluation has included laryngoscopy which was
unremarkable, a video swallow which showed trace penetration of
thin liquids without aspiration but distal esophageal narrowing,
and barium swallow showing esophageal dysmotility. 

She decided to present for emergency evaluation today after an
unprompted choking sensation during which she felt as if she
could not speak. She also has been having increasing frequency 
of
dry heaving, which has been treated with ondansetron by her PCP.
She has lost almost 20 lbs in the pst year. However, she reports
that she is able to swallow food and has continued to eat 3 full
meals a day.

In the ED, initial vital signs were T:97.7 HR:74 BP:157/89 RR:18
98% RA. Labs were notable for WBC 5.4, Hgb 15.6, Plt 160. K
elevated due to hemolysis, 4.1 on recheck. CT neck showed no
airway obstruction.

Upon arrival to the floor, the patient endorses the history
above. She is not currently having any choking sensation. She
denies any chest pain, dyspnea, abdominal pain, nausea, or
vomiting.

pronounced at C4-5 and C5-6, where there is moderate to severe 
vertebral canal narrowing.

and moderate left neural foraminal narrowing. 
5. Please see concurrently obtained brain MRI for description of

Brief Hospital Course:
PATIENT SUMMARY
====================
___ old woman with a history of atrial fibrillation on 
apixaban, HTN, depression, and dysphagia, admitted for workup of 
dysphagia, found to have new diagnosis of ALS.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES
====================
#ALS
[] F/u new diagnosis of ALS: pt will call for appointment at 
next ___ clinic on ___. Discharged with script 
for riluzole 50mg BID.
[] Consider Palliative Care, Social Work consults.
[] F/u nutrition, weight. Encourage supplements per Nutrition 
eval: scandishake BID, magic cup daily, smoothie daily.

#CORD COMPRESSION
[] MRI C-spine demonstrated cord compression at C2-3, C3-4, C4-5 
and C6-7 without cord signal abnormality or abnormal 
enhancement. Per Neurology, appears chronic and not unusual for 
pt's age. No indication for urgent intervention, could consider 
further outpatient workup if pt's chronic neck pain is thought 
to be related to cervical cord compression.

ACUTE ISSUES
====================
#Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis
#Choking sensation
#Dysarthria
#Tongue fasciculations
___ year old woman with a several month history of progressive 
dysarthria, hoarseness, and to a lesser degree dysphagia. This 
is superimposed on weight loss in the past 6 months, at least 
partially stemming from significant anxiety surrounding food 
intake after an episode in ___ where she choked and required
the Heimlich maneuver. Prior outpatient workup included barium 
swallow demonstrating esophageal dysmotility. During this 
admission, SLP was consulted and video swallow study 
demonstrated significantly worsened swallow from last evaluation 
in ___. Neurology was consulted with concern for motor 
neuron disease given bulbar weakness and tongue fasciculations. 
Neuro exam notable for hypophonia, tongue fasciculations, 
wasting of thenar eminence and intrinsic hand muscles, 
fasciculations of the upper extremities, and diffuse 
hyperreflexia. Exam and EMG/NCS study consistent with ALS. MRI 
brain and C-spine without central pathology to explain her 
symptoms. New diagnosis of ALS was discussed with patient and 
family by Neuro attending Dr. ___. LFTs wnl, pt was 
discharged with script for riluzole 50mg BID and plan for follow 
up in ___ clinic.

#Weakness
#Severe malnutrition / weight loss
Patient with cachectic appearance and marked 20 pound weight 
loss over past year, despite reported adequate PO intake with 
Ensure supplements. Likely ___ ALS as above, perhaps some 
element of decreased intake secondary to fearing choking 
sensation. Per SLP evaluation, safe to continue regular diet 
with thin liquids with chin tuck pt instructed to select softer 
foods from the menu and take small bites/sips. Nutrition 
recommended supplements with scandishake BID, magic cup daily, 
smoothie daily, multivitamin with minerals. CXR without evidence 
of aspiration. The possibility of a feeding tube will be 
considered further in follow-up with neurology. 

CHRONIC ISSUES:
===============
# Afib
Continued home apixaban 5 BID.

# Depression
Continued home sertraline.

# Hypertension
Continued home carvedilol, lisinopril.
