IMAGING:
========
RIGHT LOWER EXTREMITY US ___
No evidence of deep venous thrombosis in the right lower 
extremity veins.  The peroneal veins were not identified.

CT CHEST/A/P ___
1. Esophageal obstruction at the gastroesophageal junction, 
presumably caused 
by known achalasia, with superimposed esophagitis.  No evidence 
of 
perforation. 
2. Incidental 6.2 cm right adnexal cyst.  Recommend nonemergent 
pelvic 
ultrasound for further evaluation. 
 

PELVIC ULTRASOUND ___
FINDINGS:  
  
The patient is status post hysterectomy. 
The ovaries were not identified. 
Simple right adnexal cystic lesion was incompletely evaluated 
due to overlying 
bowel loops and measures approximately 6.5 x 5.4 x 5.8 cm.  No 
internal 
vascularity or suspicious features. 
The lesion could not be visualized on transvaginal exam. 
  
IMPRESSION:

to overlying 
bowel loops, within this limitation the lesion measures 
approximately 6.5 x 
5.4 x 5.8 cm and demonstrated no internal vascularity or 
suspicious features. 
Please note that due to limited evaluation a solid component 
cannot be 
excluded with certainty.  Repeat gynecologic ultrasound advised 
in 3 months to 
assess for stability. 

UGIS ___
IMPRESSION:  
  
No evidence of leak or obstruction.  Unchanged dilatation of the 
distal 
esophagus with brief holdup of contrast.

Brief Hospital Course:
SUMMARY
=======
___ female with a past medical history of nutcracker 
esophagus, achalasia, gastroesophageal reflux disease, empty 
sella syndrome, chronic back pain and opioid use following a 
motor vehicle accident over ___ years ago, morbid obesity, 
anxiety, depression, and concern for gastroparesis, presenting 
with persistent abdominal distention and epigastric pain, 
consistent with constipation and esophageal obstruction 
secondary to achalasia. Given recurrent episodes of esophageal 
obstruction, decision was made to move forward with ___ 
myotomy per Thoracic surgery which was done on ___. The patient 
tolerated the procedure very well. Her diet was advanced and she 
was tolerating soft solids at the time of discharge.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES
===================
[] Patient's anticoagulation was changed to apixaban 5 po BID
[] Holding metoprolol succinate as patients heart rates and BPs 
WNL, ___ at home will check BPs, HR
[] Pt with diagnosis of cirrhosis, hx ___ connect to 
outpatient GI
[] Pt noted to have adnexal cyst did have repeat imaging here, 
needs follow-up in 3 months to assess for stability
[] Pt noted to be mildly thrombocytopenic. She will follow-up 
with heme as outpatient
[] Insulin was changed to glargine 24u (was 32 on admission)

ACUTE ISSUES
============
# Esophageal obstruction secondary to achalasia 
s/p previous endoscopic dilations, Botox injection, 
metoclopramide therapy. Presented with pain w/ swallowing and 
inability to keep food down x5 days. Also complaining of 
regurgitation of solid food immediately following ingestion. Had 
similar symptoms in ___ last year prior to dilatation. CT 
notable for esophageal obstruction, likely in setting of known 
achalasia. NGT placed in hospital, kept NPO for decompression. 
Following discussions with GI and thoracic surgery, decision was 
made to move forward with ___ myotomy which was done 
successfully on ___. Patient tolerated soft solids upon 
discharge, with plans to advance as outpatient with GI/Thoracics 
guidance.

# Concern for recurrent aspiration in the setting of esophageal 
obstruction
Patient with one witnessed episode of likely aspiration, similar 
to many recent episodes that she had at home. This continued to 
be high risk so she was kept NPO until her procedure. Kept head 
of bed elevated and kept on aspiration precautions even after 
the myotomy, so that risk of aspiration will be minimized.

# ? cirrhosis
# hx of ___
There is mention in the op report of a visualized cirrhotic 
liver, potentially ___ steatosis, which would be a new diagnosis 
for this patient. She has known ___, seen by GI in the past.
She did present with mild LFT abnormalities and 
thrombocytopenia, but recent CT abd/pelvis (___) does not 
describe cirrhotic appearing liver. Would consider RUQUS, 
fibroscan, biopsy, reasonable to be done as outpatient with 
guidance from hepatology.

# LLE DVT
Diagnosed in ___. Held home Xarelto, started on heparin 
IV while NPO. Restarted on apixaban upon discharge, as her po 
intake is unpredictable. Her LLE was noted to be slightly larger 
and more tender than at her baseline, and so a repeat LLE US was 
done which was negative.

# Thrombocytopenia
Platelet count of 141 on admission to ___, downtrended to 90 
during hospital stay. Likely dilutional and coagulation 
artifact, although could be related to liver disease given 
findings of cirrhosis intraoperatively. Will follow with Heme as 
outpatient. 

# right adnexal cyst
CT abd/pelvis ___ noted 6.2 x 4.1 cm right adnexal cyst, 
pelvic ultrasound was performed on ___ with stability of the 
cyst. Ultrasound report recommends repeat imaging in 3 months

# Diabetes mellitus, insulin dependent
- On glargine (24 units at bedtime) and ISS. This was a decrease 
from 32 which was her home regimen.

CHRONIC ISSUES:
===============
# tachycardia
Pt had been taking metop succinate 100 for "fast heart rates". 
No
hx of arrhythmia. HRs have been variable here, but mostly in the
___. Her metoprolol was held upon discharge as she did not 
require it while hospitalized.

# Code status
Has previously wanted to be DNR/DNI, but wants to remain full 
code for surgery. Ongoing conversation with Palliative Care. She 
remained ambivalent about her wishes for code status, 
conversation should be continued with her PCP.

# Constipation
CT on admission negative for obstruction. Per pt
at baseline. Continued on her home bowel reg. 

# Gastroesophageal reflux / hiatal hernia / gastritis 
continued home PPI: pt on lansporazole

# Lower back pain
Transitioned from IV dilaudid to po home regimen, was 
successful. Palliative Care was consulted to aid in the 
management of her chronic pain. She has been on an extensive 
pain regimen in the past and the current 8mg po 5x/day is a 
significant decrease in dosing than what she had been on in the 
past. ___ was reviewed prior to discharge.

# Empty sella syndrome 
Was on stress dose steroids, then was put back on her home dose.

# Anxiety 
 home Valium 

# Hyperlipidemia 
 home statin 

# Depression 
home DULoxetine ___ 30 

# Central sleep apnea - stable

This patient was prescribed, or continued on, an opioid pain 
medication at the time of discharge (please see the attached 
medication list for details). As part of our safe opioid 
prescribing process, all patients are provided with an opioid 
risks and treatment resource education sheet and encouraged to 
discuss this therapy with their outpatient providers to 
determine if opioid pain medication is still indicated.
