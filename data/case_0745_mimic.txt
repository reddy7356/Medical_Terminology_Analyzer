IMAGING
========
___
MRI C-SPINE
1. Infiltrative mass involving the C6 vertebral body and both 
lateral masses, 
with associated pathologic fracture, retropulsion, and anterior 
epidural mass 
causing severe spinal canal narrowing with near complete 
effacement of CSF 
around the cord, but no evidence for cord signal abnormality.  
Also extension 
into bilateral C5-C6 and C6-C7 neural foramina, as well as 
prevertebral 
extension with encasement of the extraforaminal portions of the 
C6 and C7 
nerve roots.  Also extension into the C6 transverse foramina 
with encasement of bilateral vertebral arteries. 
2. Expansile mass involving bilateral L1 vertebral body and 
right posterior elements, with multiple blood/fluid levels, and 
right greater than left epidural mass causing moderate spinal 
canal narrowing with crowding of the intrathecal nerve roots 
around the conus medullaris.  Also extension into the right 
L1-L2 neural foramina with severe narrowing and abutment of the 
exiting right L1 nerve root. 
3. 0.9 cm hemangioma in the posterior L2 vertebral body has been 
present 
dating back to the ___ CT. 
4. 2.4 cm left posterior L3 vertebral body lesion indeterminate, 
with some features of a hemangioma which were also seen on the 
___ CT.  
However, a superimposed metastasis cannot be excluded.  No 
pathologic fracture or epidural extension. 
5. No evidence for leptomeningeal metastatic disease in the 
cervical, 
thoracic, or lumbar spine. 
6. Right posterior seventh rib deformity, new compared to ___, which may reflect a chronic healed fracture versus a 
pathologic fracture of unknown chronicity. 
7. Stable subcentimeter right posterior hepatic lesions compared 
to the ___ CT, compatible with hemangiomas. 
8. Subcentimeter cystic lesions in both kidneys, only one of 
which was seen on the ___ CT. 

MRI HEAD
Diffuse hyperintensity on FLAIR images without clear evidence 
for 
leptomeningeal enhancement on postcontrast T1 weighted or MP 
RAGE images.  
This appearance is nonspecific but occasionally can be seen in 
the setting of 
recent lumbar puncture, or following administration of high 
fraction of 
supplemental oxygen; please correlate with any recent 
intervention.  Other 
diagnostic considerations include subtle leptomeningeal 
carcinomatosis.  The 
patient does not appear to have symptoms of infectious 
meningitis according to 
the ED and hospitalist notes. 

CT ABD PELVIS
1. 4.2 cm L1 vertebral body lytic lesion with soft tissue 
extension into the 
anterior and right lateral spinal canal.  Moderate spinal canal 
narrowing. 
2. Additional sclerotic and lytic lesions are noted along the 
vertebra and 
pelvis, concerning for bone metastasis. 

CT CHEST
1. Expansile lesion involving the L1 vertebral body, right 
pedicle and right 
lamina with soft tissue extension into the central spinal canal 
causing spinal 
canal narrowing. 
2. New expansile lesions of the left eighth and right seventh 
ribs with 
pathologic fractures. 
3. New 5 mm sclerotic foci in the sternum and punctate sclerotic 
foci in the 
T7 vertebral body. 
4. No evidence of pulmonary metastases or lymphadenopathy in the 
chest. 
5. Mild bibasilar atelectasis. 
6. Please see separate dictation for CT abdomen and pelvis 
performed on same 
day for description of subdiaphragmatic findings. 

___ BONE SCAN
1. Increased uptake consistent with metastatic disease at the 
left 
lateral eighth rib, posterior right seventh rib, and L1, as seen 
on the recent 
CT scan.  There is no increased uptake visualized at T7. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
ONCOLOGY COURSE ___
Ms. ___ is a ___ year old woman with hx of Stage IIB left 
breast cancer s/p radical mastectomy and adjuvant chemo/RT on 
hormone therapy for ___ yrs, who presents with acute severe low 
back pain and is found to have multiple new vertebral lesions
without radiologic or clinical evidence of cord compression 
concerning for metastatic malignancy.

ACTIVE ISSUES:
#New vertebral lesions
C6 vertebral body extending into central canal causing severe 
narrowing and near complete effacement of CSF. L1 extends 12 mm 
into spinal canal with mod-severe canal narrowing and crowding 
of cauda equina nerve roots No cord signal abnormality or 
definite radiographic evidence of compression. Neuro exam with 
good strength but with paresthesia of the right thigh, which is 
likely in the setting of moderate-severe stenosis and cauda 
equine crowding. Metastatic breast cancer is the most likely 
etiology, likely recurrent breast but MM and other solid tumors 
remain in
the differential diagnosis. CT chest notes L1 lesion, expansile 
lesions of left eighth and right seventh ribs, 5 mm sclerotic 
foci in the sternum, punctate T7 foci. Bone scan shows 
metastatic disease at the left lateral eighth rib, posterior 
right seventh rib, and L1. She received 10mg dexamethasone x1 
then 4mg BID with no change in neurologic exam. Neurosurgery was 
consulted and course is detailed below. Pain controlled with 
oral oxycodone and IV morphine. 

#Stage IIB breast cancer
#Concern for bony metastatic recurrence
Evidence of vertebral and rib metastases based on bone scan and 
CT scans. No further evidence of disease on CT chest abdomen and 
pelvis. Exemestane was continued. Radiation oncology was 
consulted and will plan to follow up as an outpatient. 
Neuro-oncology was consulted regarding abnormal MRI with concern 
for but not diagnostic for leptomeningeal disease. Neursurgery 
was consulted and underwent biopsy and management as below.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES
===================
[] Follow up with radiation oncology when pathology returns for 
consideration of radiation therapy in the lumbar lesions
[] Follow up with neuro-oncology recommendations/consideration 
for LP or further imaging given the potential for leptomeningeal 
disease in the brain MRI, though it was non-diagnostic

=========================================
Neurosurgical course ___

Patient underwent C6 corpectomy with C5-C7 ACDF on ___ 
with Dr. ___. The procedure was uncomplicated. EBL 150 cc. 
Patient was taken to the PACU and then transferred to the floor. 


Postoperatively, patients pain was well controlled with Tylenol 
and oxycodone as needed. She was on a decadron taper which was 
tapered off with the last dose scheduled for ___. She was 
started on a full liquid diet and allowed to advance her diet as 
tolerated to a regular diet starting POD1. Her home ulcerative 
colitis medications were ordered to start on POD1. Her JP drain 
had 10 cc of serosanguinous drainage on POD0 and 45 cc on POD1 
and was taken out on POD1. Her foley was removed the morning of 
POD1 and she subsequently voided without issue.

For activity, she was kept in a hard c-collar at all times with 
brief removal for care and hygiene. She does not need to wear a 
brace for her L1 lesion. She became moderately orthostatic when 
working with ___ on POD1 with HR elevation to 130 after climbing 
stairs. She otherwise remained hemodynamically stable. She 
worked with physical therapy again on POD2 who recommended 
discharge to home.

At the time of discharge, patient was voiding, tolerating a 
regular diet, and ambulating independently. She was 
neurologically intact with full strength and pain was well 
controlled on minimal medication. She was given appropriate 
prescriptions and instructions for followup, as well as return 
precautions.
