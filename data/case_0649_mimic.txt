FINDINGS: This exam is not tailored for supradiaphragmatic 
evaluation, note 
is made of microatelectasis in the dependent portions of the 
lungs. Heart 
size is normal. 
 
Patient is status post a TIPS procedure. The liver is homogenous 
in 
attenuation without discrete masses or lesions. The gallbladder 
is not 
distended and contains gallstones. No gallbladder wall edema or 
pericholecystic fluid identified. The pancreas and spleen are 
unremarkable.  
Kidneys are normal in size and excrete contrast symmetrically. 
There is 
redemonstration of bilateral renal cysts. There is no 
hydroureter. The right 
adrenal gland contains a stable 1-cm nodule. The right adrenal 
gland is 
unremarkable.  
  
The stomach, small bowel, and large bowel are not distended and 
demonstrate 
normal wall thickness. There is no free fluid or free air within 
the abdomen. 
No mesenteric, retroperitoneal, or portacaval lymphadenopathy is 
identified. 
 
The aorta demonstrates diffuse atherosclerotic disease with 
mural thrombus and 
irregularity. A narrowing is identified at the takeoff of the 
celiac and 
superior mesenteric artery, though patency is maintained. 
  
CT PELVIS: The appendix is visualized and is normal. There is no 
free fluid 
within the pelvis. The rectum and sigmoid colon are 
unremarkable. No 
pelvic or inguinal lymphadenopathy identified. There is a small 
right-sided 
fat-containing inguinal hernia. 
  
OSSEOUS STRUCTURES: There are no suspicious lytic or blastic 
lesions 
identified. Degenerative changes are noted in the lower lumbar 
spine with 
some disc space height loss, most notable in the L1-L2 and L2-L3 
disc spaces.  
Anterior osteophyte formation is identified. 
  
IMPRESSION: 
1. Patient is status post TIPS with a normal-appearing liver. 
2. Cholelithiasis without evidence of cholecystitis. 
3. Left adrenal 1-cm mass. Given year long stability and lack of 
suspicious 
features, this statistically represents an adenoma. If further 
investigation 
is desired, could be further evaluated with an adrenal MRI. 
4. Diffuse aortic atherosclerosis with mural thrombus and 
calcification 
narrowing though not occluding the ostium of the mesenteric 
vessels. 
  
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

Colonoscopy ___:
Findings:  
 Protruding Lesions A fungating non-bleeding mass of malignant 
appearance was found in the distal sigmoid colon. The mass 
caused a partial obstruction. The scope did NOT traversed the 
lesion. With a injector needle the area was tattooed.  Cold 
forceps biopsies were performed for histology at the distal 
sigmoid colon mass.

NOT evaluated.  
Impression: Mass in the distal sigmoid colon (biopsy)
Due to the size of the mass, the rest of the colon was NOT 
evaluated.
Otherwise normal colonoscopy to sigmoid colon 
Recommendations: 1. Follow up pathology results
2. Resume diet as tolerated
3. Will discuss with primary hepatolgist
4. Consult colorectal surgery
5. Consider CT abdomen and pelvis with contrast
6. Check a CEA level 

Sigmoid Mass Pathology:
SPECIMEN SUBMITTED: G I BIOPSY (1 JAR).

Procedure date     Tissue received     Report Date    Diagnosed 
by 
___ ___. ___ 
Previous biopsies:    ___  GI BX (1 JAR) 

DIAGNOSIS: 
Colon, 20 cm, biopsy:
Colonic adenocarcinoma, low grade.

CT CHEST ABDOMEN PELVIS ___:
LUNGS: Mild apical scarring and centrilobular emphysema is seen. 
There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion. The heart size is 
normal and there is no pericardial effusion. There are no 
suspicious nodules or masses seen within the lungs. The 
descending aorta is ectatic with a significant amount of soft 
plaque. The major airways are patent to their subsegmental 
levels. 
  
ABDOMEN: The liver enhances homogeneously without evidence for 
masses. There is no biliary ductal dilatation. A TIPS stent is 
present and patent. Note is made of cholelithiasis, but no 
cholecystitis. The spleen size is top normal but homogeneous. 
The pancreas is normal. The kidneys enhance homogeneously 
without evidence for hydronephrosis. A left renal cyst (3:66) 
and right renal cyst (3:61) are noted. There is a 1-cm left 
adrenal mass which is unchanged from prior study and 
statistically represents an adenoma. The right adrenal gland is 
normal. The stomach and small bowel are normal. The ascending 
colon appears collapsed and limits complete evaluation. 
  
PELVIS: The bladder, prostate, and seminal vesicles are normal. 
Within the 
sigmoid colon is an approximately 5-cm area of thickening 
concerning for 
malignancy and corresponding to lesion seen on colonoscopy. 
There is no 
pelvic or inguinal lymphadenopathy present. No free fluid is 
seen. Again 
noted is a small right side fat-containing inguinal hernia. 
  
BONES: There are no suspicious lytic or blastic lesions 
concerning for 
metastatic disease. There are stable degenerative changes about 
the lower 
lumbar spine with disc space narrowing at L2-L3. 
  
IMPRESSION: 
1. Approximately 5-cm sigmoid mass concerning for malignancy. 
There is no 
evidence for metastatic disease and no lymphadenopathy. 
2. Highly ectatic aorta with extensive atherosclerotic 
calcification and 
plaque formation. 
3. Status post TIPS which is widely patent. 
4. Cholelithiasis without cholecystitis. 
5. Unchanged 1-cm left adrenal nodule, statistically 
representing an adenoma. 
6. Collapsed ascending colon which cannot be completely 
evaluated on this 
study. If clinically indicated, a CT colonoscopy can be 
performed for better 
evaluation. 

TTE ___:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. No atrial septal defect is 
seen by 2D or color Doppler. The estimated right atrial pressure 
is ___ mmHg. There is mild symmetric left ventricular 
hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic 
function (LVEF>55%). Doppler parameters are indeterminate for 
left ventricular diastolic function. Right ventricular chamber 
size and free wall motion are normal. The ascending aorta is 
mildly dilated. The descending thoracic aorta is mildly dilated. 
The abdominal aorta is mildly dilated. There are three aortic 
valve leaflets. The aortic valve leaflets are moderately 
thickened. There is critical aortic valve stenosis (valve area 
<0.8cm2). Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve 
leaflets are mildly thickened. Physiologic mitral regurgitation 
is seen (within normal limits). The estimated pulmonary artery 
systolic pressure is normal. There is no pericardial effusion. 

IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy and 
cavity size with preserved global and regional biventricular 
systolic function. Mildly dilated ascending aorta, descending 
thoracic aorta, and abdominal aorta. Critical aortic stenosis by 
transvalvular velocity and gradients, but visually the aortic 
valve appears to be more pliable, and likely consistent with 
moderate to severe aortic stenosis. Normal pulmonary artery 
systolic pressure. 

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of ___, 
the severity of aortic stenosis has increased by transvalvular 
velocity and gradients from moderate to critical; however, 
visually the valve appears to be similarly pliable.  

___ KUB: 
There is residual contrast in the colon with increase in fecal 
material in the ascending and descending colon. There is no 
evidence of bowel obstruction. Moderate degenerative changes are 
in the lumbar spine. A TIPS stent is present.

___ Pathology: 
DIAGNOSIS: 
I.  Sigmoid colon, segmental colectomy (A-S, U-AD):
  1.  Invasive adenocarcinoma; see synoptic report.
  2.  Sixteen lymph nodes with no carcinoma identified ___ 
additional levels are examined on blocks N and U).
II.  Anastomotic donuts (T):
Colonic fragments with no carcinoma seen.

___ TEE Intraoperatively: No spontaneous echo contrast is 
seen in the left atrial appendage. Overall left ventricular 
systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50-55%). Right ventricular 
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. 
The descending thoracic aorta is mildly dilated. There are 
complex (>4mm) atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. The 
aortic valve leaflets are severely thickened/deformed. There is 
critical aortic valve stenosis (valve area <0.8cm2). Mild (1+) 
aortic regurgitation is seen. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is 
seen. There is no pericardial effusion.
At the end of the operation there were no changes. 

___ CXR: ___ catheter is in the main pulmonary 
artery. There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion. There is 
mild cardiomegaly. Aside from atelectasis in the left lower 
lobe, the lungs are grossly clear. Emphysema and scarring in the 
right upper lobe are better seen in prior CT from ___. 
There is pneumoperitoneum. There is a TIPS stent.

___ KUB: IMPRESSION: 1) Findings are consistent with a 
postoperative small bowel ileus. If concern for mechanical small 
bowel obstruction persists, a CT would provide better 
characterization.
2) Intraperitoneal free air compatible with recent surgery.

___ CXR: FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph, 
the patient has received a nasogastric tube. The tube shows 
normal course and the tip projects over the middle parts of the 
stomach. Normal size of the cardiac silhouette. No pleural 
effusions. No pneumothorax. The previously placed ___ 
catheter has been removed. The free intraperitoneal air, 
previously visible in the right upper quadrant, has completely 
resolved.

___ CT Abdomen: IMPRESSION:
1. Mildly dilated fluid-filled loops of ascending and descending 
colon
suggestive of focal ileus. Patent distal colon without clear 
transition point to suggest large bowel obstruction.
2. Minimally prominent loops of small bowel measuring up to 2.5 
cm, however, no signs of clear obstruction. Findings may also be 
secondary to
postoperative ileus.
3. Expected moderate pneumoperitoneum due to recent sigmoid 
colectomy.
4. Normal appearance of the surgical anastomosis. No evidence of
extraluminal leak or stenosis.
5. No organized fluid collection in the abdomen or pelvis to 
suggest abscess.
6. Standard position of TIPS shunt which appears grossly patent.
7. Stable bulky appearance of the bilateral adrenal glands, left 
greater than right.

___ KUB: IMPRESSION: Non-obstructive bowel gas pattern. Air 
seen throughout the non-dilated colon, extending to the rectum, 
could reflect mild colonic ileus.

Brief Hospital Course:
Primary Reason for Hospitalization:
___ y/o male with HIV, HCV, cirrhosis c/b ascites with recurrent 
varcieal bleeds s/p TIPS c/b encephalopathy, active 
endocarditis, mycotic aneurysm and severe AS who presented from 
___ with BRBPR and anemia, and found to be hyperkalemic 
with EKG changes. 

Active issues:

# Colon adenocarcinoma: Pt presented due to BRBPR and anemia on 
outpatient labs.  It was decided to proceed with inpatient 
colonoscopy since he continued to have BRBPR and there was 
concern about monitoring his fluid status during prep for 
colonoscopy given his comorbidities (particularly severe AS).  
Unfortunately colonoscopy on ___ showed a sigmoid mass, and 
pathology confirmed adenocarcinoma.  He was evaluated by the 
colorectal surgery service, who recommended resection.  Due to 
his severe aortic stenosis, he was also evaluated by the 
cardiology service, who felt that he could proceed with surgery 
with intraoperative TEE monitoring and did not require valve 
replacement prior to surgery.  

# Acute on chronic anemia: Pt presented with Hct 22, baseline 
Hct ~28.  Likely ___ colon cancer.  He received 1 unit pRBCs and 
his Hct appropriately increased.  On discharge his Hct was 30.1. 
 

#. Aortic Stenosis: ___ on TTE obtained ___ cm2. He was 
evaluated by cardiology service pre-operatively, who felt he 
could proceed with surgery with intraoperative cardiac 
monitoring.  He is being evaluated for possible AVR as outpt. 

#. Acute on CKD: Creat elevated to 1.4 on admission, thought 
likely pre-renal.  His creatinine returned to his baseline of 
1.1 without intervention.  
  
#. Hyperkalemia: Potassium was elevated on admission to 6.0 with 
EKG changes concerning for peaked T waves.  He received 
insulin/glucose/calcium and kayexolate and his potassium 
returned to normal.  Thought likely ___ high potassium content 
diet (pt frequently eats bananas, baked potatoes at home) and/or 
acute on chronic renal failure.  Felt unlikely to be related to 
losartan therapy since he had been on it for ___ years.  He was 
counseled about avoiding high potassium foods.
  
#. S. anginosus Bacteremia: During previous hospitalization, pt 
had blood cx ___ and ___ that grew Strep anginosus in 
setting of GI bleed.  He was initially treated with clindamycin 
but then switched to IV ceftriaxone after speciation became 
available.  He was continued on his home IV ceftriaxone on 
admission, and he remained afebrile with nl WBC.  He completed 
his course of ceftriaxone on ___ (was treated for 4 weeks to 
empirically treat endocarditis although no vegetation was seen 
on TTE during previous admission).  Blood cultures were repeated 
on ___ and were negative.    

Chronic issues:

#. Idiopathic Cirrhosis s/p TIPS: On admission pt's LFTs, T 
bili, and INR were normal.  He has h/o esophageal varices on no 
varices were visualized on EGD of ___ during previous 
hospitalization. He was continued on his home rifaximin, 
nadolol, sucralfate.

#. HIV: Stable. Last CD4 94 on ___, viral load 
undectectable.  He was continued on his home darunavir, 
ritonavir, lamivudine, and dapsone.

#. Gastric ulcers:  Diagnosed on EGD during previous 
hospitalization in ___.  He was continued on his home PPI and 
sucralfate.

Transitional issues:
- He maintained DNR/DNI code status (reversed for procedures and 
surgery).

The patient was transitioned to the care of the Colon and Rectal 
Surgery service on ___.  
The patient presented to pre-op on ___. Pt was 
evaluated by anaesthesia and taken to the operating room for 
open sigmoid colectomy w/primary anastomosis. Please see the 
operative note for details. Pt was monitored intraoperatively 
with a TEE and no changes in hemodynamics were noted. Pt was 
extubated, taken to the TSICU overnight for close cardiopumonary 
monitoring with arterial line and swanz ganz catheter.  Patient 
recovered well without incident and was transferred to floor on 
POD 1 after removal of Swanz and Arterial line.  
Post-operatively: 
Neuro: The patient was alert and oriented throughout his 
recovery; pain was initially managed with a diluadid PCA and IV 
tylenol; he was transitioned to intermittent dilaudid on POD 2.  
He was transitioned to oral pain medications on POD 5 but was 
put back on IV tylenol after having to place and NGT for 
vomiting.  He was again put on PO pain meds on POD 8 after diet 
was advanced and pain was well controlled.  
CV: The patient was closely monitored from a cardiovascular 
standpoint with a goal SBP above 120mmHg.  Patient recieved 
fluid boluses PRN as well as albumin to keep pressures in an 
acceptable range and his beta blocker was held postoperatively 
until his pressures and HR improved.  By POD 3 he had become 
cardiovacularly stable - vital signs were routinely monitored.
Pulmonary: The patient remained stable from a pulmonary 
standpoint; vital signs were routinely monitored. Good pulmonary 
toilet, early ambulation and incentive spirometry were 
encouraged throughout hospitalization. 
GI/GU/FEN: He was initially kept NPO and he was advanced to sips 
on POD 1 and clears on POD 2.  Patient continued to have 
problems with nausea and distension and his diet was backed down 
to NPO and then re-advanced after having several small BM's 
though no flatus.  On POD 5 he vomited 300cc, put back to sips, 
KUB showed air fluid levels,and 
an NGT was placed putting out 500cc of bilious fluid.  On POD 6 
a CT scan that day failed to show leak or ascites and confirmed 
an ileus.  On POD 7 HIV meds were crushed and placed down NGT 
without issue and clamping trials were started after he began to 
pass flatus and had low residuals.  On POD 8 NGT was d/c and he 
has advanced to sips without issue and a KUB was obtained after 
he stopped passing flatus and it showed colonic air - pt was 
given a suppository and began passing large amounts of flatus 
and had a BM which continued into POD 9 at which time he was 
advanced to a regular diet which was well tolerated.  A JP drain 
was discontinued on POD 4 and a stitch was placed which was 
removed before discharge.  C. diff was sent on POD 6 for liquid 
stools but were all negative.  Foley was dicontinued at midnight 
on POD 3 without incident.  PICC line was dinscontinued before 
discharge.  Patient's intake and output were closely monitored 
and electroyltes repleted as needed. 
ID: The patient's fever curves were closely watched for signs of 
infection, of which there were none. Blood, urine, and stool 
cultures were all negative.  
HEME: The patient's blood counts were closely watched for signs 
of bleeding post-operatively, of which there were none.  No 
post-operative transfusions were required and hematocrit was 30 
at discharge and stable without signs of GI bleed.  
Prophylaxis: The patient received subcutaneous heparin and ___ 
dyne boots were used during this stay; he was encouraged to get 
up and ambulate as early as possible.

At the time of discharge, the patient was doing well, afebrile 
with stable vital signs.  The patient was tolerating a regular 
diet, ambulating, voiding without assistance, and pain was well 
controlled.  The patient received discharge teaching and 
follow-up instructions with understanding verbalized and 
agreement with the discharge plan.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,

You were admitted to ___ because you were anemic.  You had a 
colonoscopy, which unfortunately showed a cancer in your colon.  
You were evaluated by the colorectal surgery service, who 
recommended surgical removal of the mass.  You received 1 unit 
of blood prior to surgery and your blood counts improved.

You were admitted to the hospital after an open Sigmoid 
Colectomy with Primary Anastamosis for surgical management of 
the mass obstructing your colon which was revealed to be colonic 
adenocarcinoma. You have recovered from this procedure well and 
you are now ready to return home. Samples from your colon were 
taken and this tissue was sent to the pathology department for 
analysis. As mentioned during you visit the results were that it 
was cancerous and you will need to continue to follow up with 
the Oncologists at ___. 

You have tolerated a regular diet, passing gas and your pain is 
controlled with pain medications by mouth. You may return home 
to finish your recovery.

We made no changes to your medications while you were in the 
hospital but we did add medications for pain and a stool 
softener.  Please continue taking your medications as prescribed 
by your outpatient providers.

Please monitor your bowel function closely. Some loose stool and 
passing of small amounts of dark, old appearing blood are 
explected however, if you notice that you are passing bright red 
blood with bowel movments or having loose stool without 
improvement please call the office or go to the emergency room 
if the symptoms are severe. If you are taking narcotic pain 
medications there is a risk that you will have some 
constipation. Please take an over the counter stool softener 
such as Colace, and if the symptoms does not improve call the 
office. If you have any of the following symptoms please call 
the office for advice or go to the emergency room if severe: 
increasing abdominal distension, increasing abdominal pain, 
nausea, vomiting, inability to tolerate food or liquids, 
prolonges loose stool, or constipation. 

You have a long vertical incision on your abdomen that was 
closed with staples.  These have been removed and covered with 
Steri-strips which should remain in place for ___ days.  This 
incision can be left open to air or covered with a dry sterile 
gauze dressing if the incision become irritated from clothing.  
Please monitor the incision for signs and symptoms of infection 
including: increasing redness at the incision, opening of the 
incision, increased pain at the incision line, draining of 
white/green/yellow/foul smelling drainage, or if you develop a 
fever. Please call the office if you develop these symptoms or 
go to the emergency room if the symptoms are severe.  You may 
shower, let the warm water run over the incision line and pat 
the area dry with a towel, do not rub. 

No heavy lifting for at least 6 weeks after surgery unless 
instructed otherwise by Dr. ___ Dr. ___. You may 
gradually increase your activity as tolerated.

RADIOLOGY:
___ CT HEAD - FINDINGS: There is no intracranial hemorrhage, 
mass effect, shift of midline structures or edema. Gray-white 
matter differentiation is normally preserved. The ventricles and 
cerebral sulci are normal in size and configuration. Basal 
cisterns are symmetric. There are no fractures. The visualized 
paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are normally pneumatized 
and aerated. There are calfications of the cavernous internal 
carotid arteries bilaterally. Two 
right frontal skin staples are noted.   
IMPRESSION: No intracranial hemorrhage or edema. No fracture. 
.
CT A&P ___ - INDICATION: ___ male with upper GI 
bleed, referred for evaluation of 
portal venous anatomy prior to TIPS. 
  
COMPARISON: No prior cross-sectional imaging is available for 
review. Prior 
ultrasound dated ___ and angiography from attempted TIPS 
on ___ 
were reviewed. 
  
TECHNIQUE: Multiphasic imaging of the abdomen was performed 
prior to and 
following the intravenous administration of 90 cc of Visipaque 
intravenous 
contrast. Multiplanar reformats were prepared and reviewed. 
  
FINDINGS: Visualized lung bases demonstrate no acute 
abnormality, including 
no consolidation or effusion. There are no pulmonary nodules or 
masses 
identified. The heart base is unremarkable, without pericardial 
effusion. 
There are aortic valvular calcifications. 
  
The liver is somewhat nodular in contour, with a cirrhotic 
appearance. There 
is moderate simple ascites (without evidence of hemoperitoneum) 
and 
splenomegaly with the spleen measuring up to 14 cm in long axis, 
compatible 
with portal hypertension. Thickening of the gastric folds may 
also reflect 
portal gastropathy. 
  
On arterially phased imaging, the perfusion of the liver is 
markedly 
heterogeneous. There are no arterially hyperenhancing lesions. 
On delayed 
imaging, there are persistent geographic, somewhat linear 
regions of 
hypoattenuation, compatible with the sequelae of recent failed 
TIPS. There 
are no additional focal liver lesions identified.  
  
The hepatic veins are patent. Hepatic arteries are patent. Note 
is made of a 
replaced right hepatic artery arising off the SMA.  
  
The superior mesenteric vein and proximal portal vein are widely 
patent with 
wall-to-wall contrast opacification. However, in the mid portal 
vein, 
extending to the portal bifurcation and into the right and left 
intrahepatic 
portal branches, there is non-occlusive thrombus identified. The 
intrahepatic 
portal branches, particularly on the right, are attenuated, 
which may reflect 
thrombus versus limited portal flow. 
  
There is cholelithiasis, without evidence of acute 
cholecystitis. The 
gallbladder wall is thin. The spleen is enlarged, without focal 
lesions. The 
pancreas is mildly atrophic, without pancreatic ductal dilation 
or focal 
pancreatic lesions. The adrenal glands appear normal. The 
kidneys contain 
multiple low-attenuation rounded lesions, too small to 
definitively 
characterize, but most likely benign cysts. Kidneys enhance 
symmetrically and 
demonstrate no hydronephrosis. 
  
The stomach demonstrates apparent fold thickening, which again 
may suggest 
portal gastropathy. Intra-abdominal loops of small bowel are 
unremarkable. 
There is diffuse colonic wall thickening and edema, though 
evaluation is 
limited by underdistention. While this may, in the proper 
clinical setting, 
reflects colitis, it is more likely indicative of portal 
hypertension given 
the associated findings above. 
  
There is no mesenteric or retroperitoneal adenopathy identified. 
The aorta 
demonstrates diffuse atherosclerotic disease, with mural 
thrombus and 
irregularity. The ostia of the mesenteric vessels, including the 
celiac and 
superior mesenteric artery, demonstrates moderate 
atherosclerotic narrowing, 
though these vessels still opacify normally. 
  
BONE WINDOWS: There is spondylosis in the visualized 
thoracolumbar spine, 
without suspicious lytic or sclerotic osseous lesion. 
  
IMPRESSION: 
1. Cirrhotic-appearing liver, with evidence of portal 
hypertension, including 
ascites, splenomegaly, and gastric/colonic wall edema. 
2. Non-occlusive thrombus within the mid portal vein extending 
into the 
intrahepatic right and left portal veins. The more distal 
intrahepatic portal 
venous branches are attenuated, which may reflect additional 
thrombosis. 
3. Patency of the hepatic arteries, with incidental note of 
replaced right 
hepatic artery arising off the superior mesenteric artery. 
4. Heterogeneous perfusion of the liver on arterial phase 
images, with 
geographic, somewhat linear regions of persistent 
hypoattenuation within the 
right lobe, reflecting sequelae of recent failed TIPS. 
5. Cholelithiasis without evidence of acute cholecystitis. 
6. Diffuse aortic atherosclerosis with mural thrombus, and 
calcification and 
narrowing of the ostium of the mesenteric vessels, as above. 
7. Aortic valvular calcifications. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
This ___ with HIV/AIDS on ___, HBV, cirrhosis c/b esophageal 
and gastric varices and recent presentation for variceal bleed 
s/p failed TIPS returns with hematemesis now s/p successful 
TIPS.
. 
* UGIB: Patient states his first ever UGIB was about 1 month 
ago. He had OSH EGD with confirmed varices. He presented to ED 
with recurrent hematemesis with HCT drop from recent baseline of 
28 to 18. Bleed was immediately concerning for a recurrent 
variceal bleed in this complicated man with known esophageal and 
gastric varices. TIPS was successfully perfomed, and patient was 
observed overnight in the MICU. Patient's Hct improved to 27 
after total of 2 units pRBCs. Patient was maintained on 
octreotide and protonix gtts. Protonix gtt changed to IV BID 
PPI, then transitioned to pantoprazole 40mg po BID. HCT remained 
stable throughout the remainder of his hospitalization. The 
patient was scheduled for repeat abdominal US in 1 week to 
assess TIPS patency. 
.
* Cirrhosis: Etiology is being worked up in the outpatient 
setting. Most likely hepatitis B related. Per records, Hep B 
serologies are consistent with cleared hepatitis B. He also had 
prior CMV viral inclusions on biopsies.Workup to date includes 
negative AMA, negative ANCA and negative Alpha 1 antitrypsin. 
Ferritin not indicative of hemachromatosis and recent 
ceruloplasmin labs still pending. HBV and HCV viral loads 
negative. 
.
* HIV/AIDS: Contacted patient's outpatient ID physician ___. 
___ to verify ___ regimen above. She states he has had 
recent undetectable viral load on current combination of 
medications. Unclear how patient contracted virus, possible 
sexual contact vs. tattoos. Denies h/o IVDU. He was continued 
outpatient ___ with Ritonavir 100mg daily, Darunavir 800mg 
daily, & Lamivudine 150mg was increased to BID. Also, continued 
on dapsone prophylaxis.

Brief Hospital Course:
Primary Reason for Admission: ___ yo M with h/o HIV (CD4 172 in 
___, VL undetectable ___, cirrhosis (unclear etiology) c/b 
ascites, variceal bleed s/p TIPS c/b encephalopathy, HTN, HLD, 
GERD, ___ esophagus, AoS ___ echo per OSH report EF 65%, 
aortic valve area 0.7) transferred from OSH for low hct, 
dyspnea.
.
Active Problems:
.
# GI bleed: At OSH, pt w/ melena and hct drop to ___ s/p 2 units 
pRBC.  On transfer to ___ TIPs by US appeared to be patent. He 
received protonix and octreotide gtt overnight, and underwent 
endoscopy in the AM that did not show varices but was evident 
for gastric ulcers s/p biopsies.  His hct remained stable in the 
___. He was discharged on protonix po and sucralfate.
.
# Bacteremia: On ___ pt began spiking fevers and was 
pan-cultured and started on Ceftriaxone and Vancomycin. 
Thereafter, he remained afebrile throughout his course. He grew 
GPCs in his blood that were speciated as Strep sensitive to 
Clindamycin. His Ceftriaxone/Vanc were d/c'ed and his was sent 
home with a 2 week course of Clindamycin with appropraite follow 
up. The primary team felt his bacteremia was ___ translocation 
in the setting of Cirrhosis and recent GIB. 
.  
# Cirrhosis: Unclear etiology, ultrasound on admission did not 
show hepatic lesions and showed patent TIPs.  He was continued 
on rifaximin. 
  
# ___: Cr on transfer 1.6, which was down from 2.1 at OSH though 
still elevated from baseline.  He was given a trial of albumin 
and Cr initially worsened. He then grew GPCs in his blood and 
was started on Vanc and IVF, at which time his ___ resolved. 
Renal was consulted in the interim and felt his ___ was 
pre-renal in the setting of sepsis and cirrhosis. At discharge, 
his Cr was 1.2. 
. 
# Aortic stenosis: Patient evaluated by cardiology at OSH, with 
stable, but severe AS that was likely contributing to his 
dyspnea.  Patient is considering percutaneous valve if continues 
to progress. On transfer he appeared volume depleted and was 
given albumin (see above). The option of AVR was discussed with 
the liver attending and recommendation was made for outpatient 
Hepatology f/u to asses whether he was well enough for surgery 
or percutaneous valve. He will see his Hepatologist this week, 
at which time surgery/perc valve can be discussed.   
. 
# Diarrhea: Patient had an episode of diarrhea at OSH, though no 
further episodes while in house. All stool studies were 
negative. 

# Dyspnea: His dyspnea improved on transfer and was felt to be 
multi-factorial: known severe aortic stenosis w/ preload 
dependence and anemia.  CXR was obtained and did not show 
evidence of infection. At the time of discahrge, he denied 
dyspnea. 
.
Chronic Problems:
.
# HIV: His antivirals epivir, norvir, darunavir and ppx 
(dapsone) were continued. CD4 count was obtained (see results). 
.  
# HLD: continued pravastatin  
 . 
# HTN: losartan held in the setting of bleed and ___ and was 
restarted s/p resolution of ___.   
.
Transitional Issues: He was discharged home with Hepatology 
follow up. He was instructed to see his PCP and ID physician 
within 1 week of discharge. Discussion of per AVR vs surgical 
AVR should be discussed with his ___ at his next 
appointment.

Pertinent Results:
___ CXR :
In comparison with study of ___, the right chest tube has been 
removed and there is no evidence of pneumothorax.  Little change 
in the 
appearance of the heart and lungs. 

___ Ba swallow :
No evidence of obstruction or other abnormalities
  

 
Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ was admitted to the hospital and taken to the 
Operating Room where he underwent a right VATS with RLL wedge 
resection x 2.  He tolerated the procedure well and returned to 
the PACU in stable condition.  Although his hemodynamics were 
stable, he required some Narcan as he was a bit oversedated.  
His narcotics were held and his pain was treated with Tylenol 
and Tramadol.  

He was transferred to the Surgical floor and maintained stable 
hemodynamics.  His chest tube had an intermittent air leak but 
it eventually resolved and his tube was removed on POD # 2.  His 
chest xray showed no pneumothorax but he complained of chest 
pain later that day.  Serial enzymes including Troponins were 
negative along with his EKG.  he also had some episodes of 
vomiting.  The vomiting resolved but his appetite was poor and 
he complained of solid food getting stuck, causing some mid 
chest fullness.  A barium swallow was done on ___ which 
showed no obstruction or other abnormalities.  He then was able 
to have soup without difficulty and actually had chicken fingers 
to perk up his appetite.  As there were no more episodes of 
dysphagia or vomiting he was discharged home on ___ and will 
follow up in the Thoracic Clinic in 2 weeks.
