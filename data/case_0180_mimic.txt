History of Present Illness:
Mr. ___ is a ___ y/o man with a PMH of metastatic 
colorectal adenocarcinoma (to duodenum and liver, s/p colectomy, 
L hepatic lobectomy, XRT to liver, and FOLFOX x4 cycles), R 
frontal lobe stroke (on enoxaparin), AFib/flutter s/p PPM, who 
presented after cardiac arrest.

He was recently admitted to ___ ___ with iron deficiency 
anemia and GI bleed and was found to have eroding mass ___ his 
duodenum, which was biopsy confirmed metastatic poorly 
differentiated carcinoma, morphologically similar to his 
metastatic colorectal adenocarcinoma. He was evaluated by 
surgery and radiation oncology and felt not to be a candidate 
for either, for which he was started on systemic chemotherapy 
with FOLFOX. He was switched from warfarin to enoxaparin for his 
stroke given his risk of bleeding. He completed his infusion of 
___ on ___. 

He then returned to ___ clinic on ___ for infusion of IV 
iron given his anemia to 8.0 g/dL. Approximately 5 minutes into 
the infusion of iron, he began to experience ___ abdominal pain 
and shortness of breath. He was given diphenhydramine, 
methylprednisolone, and morphine. He was planned for transfer to 
the ED for concern for perforation given his significant burden 
of disease, at which point he lost his pulse and ACLS was 
initiated and continued for 32 minutes. He received epinephrine 
x1 and electrical shocks x4 before ROSC was obtained. He was 
also given naloxone.

On arrival to the ED, the rhythms were consistent with 
ventricular fibrillation. There was no evidence of STEMI on 
post-arrest EKGs. He was not deemed to be a candidate for 
cardiac catheterization given his medical history significant 
for duodenal metastases from rectal cancer resulting ___ bleeding 
complications. He was loaded with 450 mg of amiodarone. Labs 
were notable for WBC 31.6, H/H 9.0/31.6, PLT 239, BUN/ Cr 
___, lactate 8.8, VBG 6.___, K+ 3.4. The etiology of his 
arrest was thought to be secondary to hypokalemia ___ the setting 
of profound acidosis. He was given sodium bicarbonate and 
initiated on norepinephrine. 

On arrival to the MICU, the patient was intubated and sedated.

IMAGING/STUDIES
===============
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST (___):
IMPRESSION:    
1.  No intracranial hemorrhage or fracture. 
2.  Paranasal sinus disease. 

ECHO (___):
GENERAL COMMENTS: Suboptimal image quality - poor apical views. 
Suboptimal image quality as the patient was difficult to 
position. Suboptimal image quality - body habitus. Suboptimal 
image quality - ventilator.   
Conclusions   
The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is moderate symmetric 
left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size 
is normal. There is moderate to severe global left ventricular 
hypokinesis (LVEF = 30 %). The right ventricular free wall 
thickness is normal. The right ventricular cavity is markedly 
dilated with severe global free wall hypokinesis. The aortic 
root is mildly dilated at the sinus level. The ascending aorta 
is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly 
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Trace aortic 
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve appears structurally 
normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is borderline 
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial 
effusion. 
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of ___, 
LV and RV function both significantly worse.   

CTA CHEST AND CT ABDOME (___):
IMPRESSION: 
1. No pulmonary embolism.  Pulmonary arteries are well seen 
through the 
subsegmental level. 
2. There are 2 foci of pneumomediastinum anterior to the heart 
which are 
likely due to rib fractures. 
3. There are multiple rib fractures including bilateral second 
ribs, left 
third rib, bilateral fourth ribs, and bilateral fifth ribs 
without significant displacement.  ___ addition there is a 
possible nondisplaced fracture of the upper sternal body (5:68). 

4. ___ to moderate bibasilar consolidation which is likely due 
to both 
atelectasis and aspiration, there is a filling defect within the 
right 
mainstem bronchus which is likely due to aspirated 
secretions/mucus. 
5. There is no free air within the abdomen.  There is a large 
infiltrative 
mass within the right upper quadrant of the abdomen which 
appears to arise 
from the liver which has central air likely due to infiltrative 
involvement of the second portion the duodenum. 
6. The mass also appears to involve the right kidney, central 
SMV, and 
pancreatic head.  The colon near the hepatic flexure is also 
likely involved.  The tumor abuts and flattens the IVC however 
it does not appear to be definitely invaded. 
7. There is an end colostomy at the left mid abdomen with a para 
stomal 
hernia.  There is dilation of the ascending, transverse, and 
descending colon which is also fluid-filled.  This is likely an 
adynamic ileus as no abrupt transition point is noted and the 
colon just proximal to the end colostomy is decompressed. 
8. Stomach is markedly dilated and filled with oral contrast.  
This is likely due to gastric outlet obstruction from duodenum 
involvement of the mass.  Decompression of the stomach through 
the indwelling enteric tube should be considered. 
  
EEG (___):
IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal continuous video EEG due to the 
presence of a slow and disorganized background, consistent with 
a moderate encephalopathy. There are abundant generalized 
broad-based sharp waves, initially occurring ___ a quasi periodic 
fashion, but they become persistently periodic reaching up to 2 
Hz by the morning of ___. No clinical correlate is seen with 
these discharges. These findings are indicative of diffusely 
increased cortical irritability and an increased propensity for 
seizures. Of note, plentiful myogenic artifact is again seen 
throughout the majority of the recording obscuring the frontal 
temporal regions bilaterally. There are no electrographic 
seizures ___ this recording. 

MRI MRA BRAIN ___ 
1. Punctate acute infarct ___ the left cerebellum.
2. Persistent occlusion of the V3 and proximal V4 segments of 
the left
vertebral artery with reconstitution of the distal V4 segment.  
No evidence
for new arterial occlusion, flow-limiting stenosis, or aneurysm.
3. Paranasal sinus disease, as described above.
 
CT C-SPINE W/O CONTRAST  ___
1. No acute fracture or acute malalignment.
2. Moderate multilevel degenerative changes most notable at 
C5-C6 with
multilevel mild spinal canal narrowing.

CT T-SPINE W/O CONTRAST  ___
1. Study is degraded by motion and by hardware streak artifact.
2. Within limits of study, no definite evidence of thoracic 
spine fracture.
3. Multilevel thoracic spine degenerative changes, as described.
4. Left greater than right consolidations again noted.
5. Partially visualized known right adrenal adenoma and 
diffusely thickened
left adrenal gland.

CT L-SPINE W/O CONTRAST  ___
1. No evidence of fracture.
2. Multiple probable bone islands as described, grossly 
unchanged compared to
___ prior exam.
3. Extensive multilevel degenerative changes of the lumbar spine 
as described,
most pronounced at L3-4 and L4-5 where there is at least mild 
spinal canal
narrowing.  If clinically indicated, consider dedicated lumbar 
spine MRI
further evaluation.

LIVER OR GALLBLADDER US (SINGLE ___
1. Mild central intrahepatic biliary dilatation with dilated 
common hepatic
duct.
2. Ill-defined mass again seen centrally within the liver and ___ 
the midline. 
This mass is difficult to visualize with ultrasound.  No 
peripheral hepatic
lesions are visualized.
3. 8 cm solid round mass partially visualized ___ the left upper 
quadrant
adjacent to the spleen which does not appear to have been 
present on the prior
CT of ___.  This mass cannot be further 
characterized with
ultrasound.

CT ABD & PELVIS WITH ___
1. New large right iliacus muscle hematoma.
2. Large right-sided abdominal mass invading the liver, right 
kidney,
pancreas, stomach/duodenum and the hepatic flexure of the colon.
3. Probable gastric outlet obstruction as well as a fistulous 
communication
between the duodenum and the patient's mass.
4. New separate liver metastasis.
 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ y/o man with a PMH of metastatic colorectal adenocarcinoma 
(to duodenum and liver, s/p colectomy, L hepatic lobectomy, XRT 
to liver, and FOLFOX x4 cycles), R frontal lobe stroke 
(previously on enoxaparin), AFib/flutter s/p PPM, who presented 
after cardiac arrest during iron infusion, s/p cooling protocol. 
Warmed and extubated successfully with residual neurologic 
deficits though without ischemic brain injury on imaging; 
hospital course c/b ongoing chronic GI bleed with 
transfusion-dependent anemia, new cerebellar stroke, HCAP s/p 
ceftaz, epileptiform discharges started on Depakote, multiple 
electrolyte abnormalities related to parastomal hernia and heavy 
ostomy output, cholangitis thought secondary to expanding mass, 
CAUTI, concern for PICC-line infection, candidemia, acute liver 
failure with hypoglycemia/thrombocytopenia/coagulopathy, and 
worsening oliguric renal failure. Hospital course was further 
complicated by ongoing difficulties defining goals of care, 
ethics consult, legal department involved ___ process of 
appointing guardian. Ultimately, Mr. ___ expired ___ from 
complications of metastatic rectal cancer, autopsy requested by 
his wife.

# GOALS OF CARE
# METASTATIC COLORECTAL CANCER
Patient had metastatic disease with multiple comorbidities, 
cardiac arrest with resulting depressed EF, anoxic brain injury 
on presentation. Initially there was consideration of further 
chemo, however this was not possible because of his mental 
status (not able to consent). Decision to place ICD lead was 
deferred. Ethics consulted given difficulties ___ contacting the 
family and medical decision making. His wife agreed to not 
pursue further chemotherapy, surgery, DNR/DNI, no ICU transfers. 
There was no official HCP on file prior to this incident and 
therefore impossible to obtain placement ___ rehab without 
appointing a guardian, which initially seemed liked it was 
possible and within goals of care. Process caused significant 
turmoil for patient's wife and family. Conversations were 
ongoing with the family but there was a process underway for an 
independent guardian. Ultimately his wife was appointed 
guardian. The topic of hospice was brought up but patient's wife 
wanted rehab if possible and was hoping for a miracle, looking 
forward to him possibly going back to work, despite 
conversations ___ which it was said that he would almost surely 
die ___ days to weeks from his disease and increasingly 
complicated comorbidities. Palliative care services were offered 
___ the context that they could help with symptom management but 
wife declined, stating she did not want another group of doctors 
involved for "symptoms." ___ medical problems made him not 
safe for rehab. Inpatient hospice was discussed but ultimately 
he was too unstable for transfer. ___ his last weeks, he 
developed acute liver failure with profound hypoglycemia, 
thrombocytopenia and coagulopathy, cholangitis, and fungemia 
from advancing mass and there were no options for definitive 
treatment. He required constant life support with IVF at high 
rates to prevent fatal hypoglycemia, electrolyte abnormalities 
and maintain blood pressure, relying on boluses as he was not a 
candidate for pressors/ICU transfer, however this was not 
sustainable due to increasingly complicated balancing of his 
various fluid needs and due to significant harm observed with 
increasingly fluid overload state which caused significant 
dyspnea and eventually inability to compensate for metabolic 
acidosis through tachypnea (which he had been doing previously), 
accompanied by rapidly worsening mental status. Ultimately, it 
was agreed between the medical team and the family to not cause 
the patient further harm and to hold IVF. He passed away within 
hours. For a problem-based summary, see below.

# CARDIAC ARREST
# PARTIAL NEUROLOGIC RECOVERY WITH RESIDUAL NEUROLOGIC DEFICITS 
Patient had a VT/Vfib cardiac arrest ___ infusion clinic while 
receiving an IV iron infusion. He underwent ___ minutes of CPR 
and was eventually intubated, sedated, and admitted to the ICU 
for cooling protocol. Regarding the etiology of his arrest, 
Electrophysiology was consulted and interrogated his pacer, 
which showed VT/Vfib. Unclear precipitatant but may have been 
related to his IV iron infusion. Imaging showed multiple rib fx 
with ___ areas of pneumomediastinum and flail chest. He was 
warmed and eventually extubated after complicated ICU course, 
and had partial recovery of his mental status, with ability to 
move all extremities, walk, speak ___ fluid sentences, and with 
orientation to self and hospital. He remainder persistently 
confused and not fully oriented to situation, and did not return 
to his baseline. MRI brain was obtained which showed new R 
cerebellar stroke but no overt evidence of anoxic brain injury. 
Overall, his mental status improved significantly ___ the first 
week after cardiac arrest but he recovered past that point 
minimally, if at all. He remained disoriented with waxing and 
waning levels of alertness, unable to participate ___ his care, 
and ___ his final days of life, was no longer oriented to self or 
speaking ___ full sentences, and had declining alertness. 

# Acute hypoxemic respiratory failure:  
# Pneumonia 
# Flail Chest 
# Pneumomediastinum
Febrile ___ the ICU with sputum culture growing GNRs, bibasilar 
consolidations on CT, multiple rib fractures (flail chest from 
chest compressions) with ___ areas of pneumomediastinum. s/p 
ceftazidime (___).  Extubated ___ and weaned to RA. 

# Hyperchloremic Non-gap Metabolic Acidosis with respiratory 
compensation
# Parastomal Hernia 
# High ostomy output
# Abdominal distension 
# Intermittent Hypernatremia
# Hypokalemia
Patient suffered continuous GI losses secondary to parastomal 
hernia which increased greatly ___ size with abdominal distension 
and englarging mass. Bicarb was steadily downtrending from ___ 
to nadir of 12 on ___, and electrolyte abnormalities were 
severe. He became dependent on multiple daily bicarb infusions 
and constant potassium repletion to maintain levels. His free 
water deficits were large and he required liters of D5 daily to 
prevent hypernatremia which peaked at 156. Ostomy output peaked 
at 3L daily, likely from increased bowel herniation after an 
issue with the noncustom abdominal binder. Ostomy team followed 
but was unable to reduce the hernia. Loperamide and tincture of 
opium were used to decrease output but were stopped multiple 
times due to concern for obstruction. C dif tested multiple 
times and was negative.

# Candidemia
Developed candidemia found on blood culture ___. Per ID, likely 
from known gastric outlet obstruction with fistula between 
duodenum and mass, vs. possible port-related infection. TPN had 
previously been discontinued. Ophtho consult revealed no eye 
involvement. He was not a candidate for removal of his port or 
other hardware and continued fluconazole for the remainder of 
his life. 

# Cholangitis
# Liver Failure
LFTs checked routinely for TPN, all elevated beginning ___, as 
well as uptrending INR, concerning for cholangitis. GGT, Dbili 
elevated. Primary concern would be acalculous cholecystitis, 
however per prior imaging, patient has a surgically absent 
gallbladder. Somewhat difficult to adequately assess patient's 
pain given verbal status, but intermittently appeared to have 
abdominal pain and distension. CT A/P with progression of mass, 
CBD dilation and obliteration of the ampulla, likely cause of 
cholangitis, as well as fistulous tract between mass and 
duodenum. Per GI and ___, palliative procedures were not an 
option. Started broad spectrum abx for cholangitis which was 
essentially palliative, narrowed to vancomycin, zosyn 
ultimately. Patient had worsening liver failure based on markers 
of synthetic liver dysfunction including hypoglycemia, 
hypoalbuminemia, thrombocytopenia, coagulopathy. He required 
constant D5 infusion and amps of D50 multiple times a day to 
prevent hypoglycemia, and developed a new ileacus hematoma 
possibly related to coagulopathy. 

# Oliguric Renal Failure
Patient's Creatinine baseline appeared to be ~1.1. Usually 
ranges from 1.1 to 1.5, initially suspected ATN related to 
hypotension vs prerenal from hypovolemia, however also received 
contrast for CT ___ so may have had component of CIN as well. 
Creatinine rose precipitously and urine output fell ___ 
concurrence with worsening liver failure and cholangitis, likely 
multi-organ failure from overall illness. Obstructive cause from 
tumor burden was possible as well. Fluid boluses did not improve 
urine output.

# Hematochezia
# Upper GI bleed
# Transfusion Dependent Anemia
# New large right iliacus muscle hematoma
History of chronic GI bleed from duodenal ulcer. Received pRBCs 
PRN, essentially transfusion dependent. CT ___ showed new large 
right iliacus muscle hematoma since ___, unclear how acute. 

# Thrombocytopenia
# Elevated LDH
New from ___. DIC labs previously negative. Haptoglobin <10 
previously however this could’ve be due to liver dysfunction. 
Reticulocyte count conveyed some element of bone marrow 
suppression. Thrombocytopenia worsened day by day, possibly DIC 
related to cancer though labs were reassuring. No overt signs of 
thrombosis and was not a candidate for anticoagulation given 
GIB.

# CAUTI
Patient had +UA concerning for UTI and had a chronic foley from 
prior urinary retention. Culture ___ growing E Coli 
pan-sensitive. Completed 10d course of ceftaz. 

# Cellulitis associated with PICC Line
Patient developed cellulitis with purulence around his PICC line 
on ___. The line was promptly removed. line tip culture was 
negative and patient did not develop signs of systemic infection 
after removal of the line. He was started on vancomycin 
initially but this was then transitioned to Keflex for a 7 day 
course (last day ___. A new PICC line was placed. RN noted 
purulence around entry site ___. IV nurse evaluated and 
concerned for infection, blood cultures drawn, PICC d/c'ed and 
tip cultured, and reaccessed his port, which had been deaccessed 
as it was not ___ use. TPN was held given no access and 
ultimately discontinued when patient became fungemic. Wound 
culture showed no significant growth but was difficult to 
interpret ___ the setting of multiple days of antibiotics prior 
to culture.

# Nutrition 
# Enteral access
# Gastric Outlet Obstruction
Patient initially had feeding tube but this was discontinued 
after high residuals were recorded. He was then started on TPN. 
Speech and Swallow evaluated him and cleared him for oral 
intake. He was slowly retrialed on oral intake and tolerating 
full liquids without evidence of obstruction; however, due to 
his mental status he was unable to meet his caloric needs so TPN 
was continued. GI was consulted regarding advanced endoscopic 
options to relieve his gastric outlet obstruction, but duodenal 
stenting and J-tube placement were considered too high risk. His 
wife requested he be given soft food as a comfort measure and 
accepted bleeding/aspiration risk.  TPN was held after potential 
line infection and discontinued upon development of fungemia.

# R frontal stroke and acute cerebellar stroke: 
R frontal lobe stroke 1 month PTA and new cerebellar lesion on 
MRI ___. Etiology likely related to his underlying Afib. New 
cerebellar lesion occurred while holding a/c for GI bleed so it 
was restarted at 1mg/kg. Ultimately lovenox and aspirin 
discontinued because of iliacus muscle hematoma.

# Ectopy
# Afib/Aflutter:
Patient was ___ A fib and was maintained on therapeutic 
anticoagulation for cerebellar stroke with lovenox 1mg/kg until 
it was held for GIB and ultimately discontinued (see above). 
Noted on telemetry to have irregular rhythm with occasional RBBB 
and paced beats. He also had occasional RVR requiring 
uptitration for his metoprolol. EP and cardiology were consulted 
and had no further recommendations regarding his rhythm control. 
Metoprolol was discontinued when he developed sepsis due to 
cholangitis, and he was no longer maintained on telemetry after 
goals of care discussion. 

#Pacemaker RV lead displacement: RV lead was displaced by chest 
compressions. EP evaluated and turned up its output and it was 
still capturing. Should be reevaluated ___ outpatient setting if 
within goals of care. 

#Seizures
Patient had epileptiform discharges on EEG ___ the ICU and was 
started on valproate per neurology.

#Fall: The patient fell on ___ as he was attempting to stand 
from a chair. He had negative Head and Spine CT. Pain controlled 
with Tylenol and lidocaine patch.

History of Present Illness:
___ y male with  A-fib/A-flutter s/p cardioversion
___, metastatic colorectal cancer to liver, papillary thyroid
cancer s/p lobectomy, grade 1 pancreatic NET, bipolar presenting
with change in mental status.

 Patient himself is awake and responds to commands. He is sleepy
(5 AM). He did not know where he was or why he is in the
hospital.

 His wife is concerned about the change in his mental status
which is new. History mstly given by wife and daughter. 
According
to them, patient was ambulating and was in normal mentation a
week ago, they feel things have changed ever since patient
underwent pacemaker placement. They are very concerned about
patient since patient does not show interest in any activities.
He seems to be drowsy most of the times and speaks very little.

     His wife reports that patient was able to care for himself
prior to previous hospitalization but now he is unable to do
anything on his own. This is a major change in his personality
and family is rightfully worried about this.

 I tried to talk to patient, but his responses are limited and
brief. He basically denied anything being wrong with him (also
reported that he has no known cardiac conditions or arrhythmias-
despite pacer a week ago)

 Family tired as they were in ER since 8PM yesterday and they 
had
to go home. Will need to re attempt to get more history 
tomorrow.
Wife requested neuro consult again.

IMAGING: 

___ CXR
Increase mild to moderate cardiomegaly and/or pericardial 
effusion.  No
evidence of cardiac decompensation or tamponade physiology.  Low 
lung volumes.

___ Head CT
No evidence of acute large territorial infarct.  The known right 
frontal lobe
infarct seen on MR from ___ppreciated 
on this exam.
No evidence of hemorrhagic transformation.

EEG
 This is an abnormal continuous ICU monitoring study because of
diffuse slowing of the background, indicative of mild to 
moderate
encephalopathy, which is non-specific with regard to etiology. 
Of note, on
single channel EKG an irregularly irregular rhythm. There are no
electrographic seizures, epileptiform discharges, or pushbutton 
events.
 
___ ECHO
The left atrium is normal in size. There is mild symmetric left 
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size. Overall left 
ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50-55%). There 
is considerable beat-to-beat variability of the left ventricular 
ejection fraction due to an irregular rhythm/premature beats. 
Right ventricular chamber size is normal with depressed free 
wall contractility. The diameters of aorta at the sinus, 
ascending and arch levels are normal. The aortic valve leaflets 
(3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. 
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets 
are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Trivial 
mitral regurgitation is seen. The estimated pulmonary artery 
systolic pressure is normal. There is no pericardial effusion. 

IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular systolic function 
with low normal global systolic function in the context of 
frequent ventricular ectopy. Depressed global right ventricular 
systolic function. No pericardial effusion. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ y male with hx Afib/flutter, metastatic colorectal cancer to 
liver, papillary thyroid cancer s/p lobectomy, grade 1 
pancreatic NET, bipolar disorder, recent admission to cardiology 
___ where cardioversion was performed and ultimately PPM 
was placed for bradycardia, course c/b likely embolic stroke, 
re-admitted ___ with encephalopathy and elevated lithium 
levels, hypercalcemia, urinary retention.

# Acute metabolic Encephalopathy.  Neurology and psychiatry 
consulted.  Did not appear consistent with a stroke syndrome and 
head CT reassuring.  EEG neg for sz.  Felt ultimately to be due 
to lithium toxicity, renal failure, hypercalcemia.  At the time 
of discharge, pt was near his baseline, aao x3, able to do days 
of the week backwards but still stated that he felt a little 
"foggy."

# Hx bradycardia, Atrial Fibrillation, s/p PAcemaker ___ now with ? of PAF with abberancy yesterday vs. NSVT.  
HVMAcardiology (___) indicated that most c/w VP for a tach.  
Dr. ___ increase in BB dose to 37.5 mg to try to 
suppress PVCs and PAF further, this done and tolerated well. EP 
interrogated pacemaker and inspected site without acute clinical 
concerns. Pt to f/u with cardiology as an outpt.

# Recent R frontal stroke: Stable without overt sequellae.  
Neurology consulted, did not recommend further brain imaging 
beyond head CT.  INR was supertherapeutic on admission and pts 
warfarin was titrated to therapeutic levels and pt was 
ultimately discharged on 4 mg daily with close f/u, especially 
given initiation of depacote.

# HFPEF - echo stable, asymptomatic.  Seen by ___ cardiology 
here.  Will follow as outpatient. 

___, CKD - improved with fluids.  Baseline Cr (likely 1.1) 
achieved.
     
# bipolar disorder: Given now two hospitalizations for lithium 
toxicity and fluctuating renal function, advancing age and 
medical comorbidity, lithium was held.  Psychiatry was consulted 
and recommended depakote which was started without incident.  Pt 
was scheduled with psychiatry follow up prior to discharge.

# Hypercalcemia - slight, likely contributing to encephalopathy 
on presentation, and likely due to lithium toxicity.  Improved 
with hydration and torsemide calciuresis, level at d/c had 
normalized.

# Urinary retention on presentation.  Required urinary catheter 
for 36 hours - foley removed, no issues with voiding since

# Iron deficiency anemia: stable at discharge.  ___ be due to 
slow bleed from known malignancy, however no e/o active 
bleeding.  Recommend outpt follow up and consideration of iron 
supplementation.

# elevated alk phos: mild and improving, would monitor as outpt 
and pursue additional w/u if persistently elevated.

# Metastatic colon cancer: pt was advised to schedule f/u with 
his oncologist

# Hypertension: BPs well controlled off meds while in the 
hospital, therefore they were not continued on discharge.  
Please check BPs as an outpt and add back antihypertensives as 
needed.

# Foot care: pts wife requesting podiatry for foot care while in 
the hospital.  Please arrange outpt podiatry f/u.

# Deconditioning: pt with weakness at time of dc but cleared by 
___ to go home with intermittent assistance.  He will have home 
___ and home safety eval.

Pt is stable for DC.  >30 min spent on dc related activities.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr ___,
You were admitted to the hospital with confusion, which we think 
was due to high lithium levels.  You improved with 
discontinuation of this medication.  You were switched to a new 
medication, Depakote, which you should take on discharge from 
the hospital.  It is very important that you follow up with Dr 
___ as well as Dr. ___ discharge.  Additionally, 
please follow up with your new psychiatrist who can monitor your 
psychiatric medications.  You should also follow up with your 
oncologist as previously scheduled.  Your blood pressure was 
well controlled without medications while you were in the 
hospital, therefore your amlodipine and lisinopril were stopped. 
 Please discuss with your doctor if and when these medications 
should be restarted.  Finally, please have your INR checked on 
___.  

You are still somewhat weak and we therefore recommend that you 
be seen by physical therapy at home, and we recommend that you 
have intermittent assistance from family as needed while at home 
and when leaving your home.  

Podiatry was unable to see you while you were in the hospital.  
Please talk with your PCP who can arrange this after discharge.

Brief Hospital Course:
On ___, patient underwent left hepatic lobectomy, resection 
of lesion in segment 5 and intraoperative ultrasound for 
metastatic rectal CA to liver. Surgeon was Dr. ___. 
Please refer to operative note for complete details. A ___ 
___ drain placed to the right abdomen along the cut surface of 
the liver. 

On postop day 1, he was heplocked and diet was advanced to 
clears. Pain was well controlled with an epidural. Epidural and 
foley were removed on postop day 2. 

Patient became agitated and confused on postop day 3 for which a 
code purple was called. Olanzapine and haldol were given for 
agitation. He was pan cultured. UA was positive and urine 
culture had GNR. (pan sensitive Klebsiella) IV Ceftriaxone was 
started. He was also tachycardic and EKG demonstrated Afib. His 
home dose of metoprolol was resumed. Altered mental status with 
confusion persisted. Calcium was noted to be 13.5. IV fluid was 
given and an endocrine consult obtained. 

Recommendations were to continue aggressive IV hydration, 
Pamidronate and calcitonin x1, and hold Lithium which could 
contribute to hypercalcemia. It was thought that he had primary 
hyperparathyroidism. PTH was elevated to 210. Aggessive IV 
hydration continued. Lithium level was 1.0. Mental status 
improved but he became very agitated on ___ and another Code 
Purple was called and Haldol w restraints were required. Mental 
status improved. 

Calcium decreased daily to 10 by ___. On ___, he appeared to 
be alert/oriented but with questioning, it was clear that he 
still had altered mental status and was irritable. Psychiatry 
was consulted and felt that he was delirious. Recommendations 
were given for prn Haldol. He was given 1mg of IV Haldol with 
improvement. Endocrine recommended holding lithium until level 
was less than 11. On ___, lithium level was 0.4 and lithium 
was resumed. Psychiatry recommended having patient follow up 
with PCP at ___ Dr. ___ has assumed Lithium 
prescribing, and to have lithium level checked next week. 

Endocrine noted nearly undetectable Vit D level on ___ and 
felt that could contribute to hypercalcemia. The plan was to 
slowly replete the Vitamin D with ___ IU/day. He remained in 
the hospital an additional day for Q 12 hour calcium monitoring. 
Discharge calcium was 9.4. He was given phos repletion and sent 
home with one week of phos neutral with planned appointment with 
his endocrinologist on ___. Concern for low calcium, signs 
reviewed with patient and he is to have ___ services at home 
that also received notation of need for monitoring for 
hypocalcemia at home.

Of note, urine culture isolated Klebsiella pneumonia >100,000 
colonies. Ceftriaxone was continued for 3 days.  

By postop day 6, he was tolerating a regular diet, ambulating 
with supervision and having BMs (via ostomy). Of note, stoma was 
markedly prolapsed. Abdomen was non-distended. Incision was 
intact with staples without redness/bleeding. JP drain output 
was non bilious. LFTs had initially increased postop, but 
improved over hospital course. JP drain was removed prior to 
discharge.
The wound nurse was consulted for the stoma prolapse. She was 
able to reduce to about 2 inches, and he was given supplies to 
help maintain the reduction. He continued to have stool output.

The plan was to f/u on ___ with outpatient Endocrinologist for 
management of hyperparathyroidism. He was instructed to seek 
medical attention for s/o hyperparathyroidism.

Mr. ___ is a ___ with hx Afib/flutter on Coumadin s/p 
cardioversion, metastatic colorectal cancer to liver s/p 
colectomy, papillary thyroid cancer s/p thyroid lobectomy, grade 
1 pancreatic NET, thoracic cancer, and recent R frontal embolic 
stroke two weeks ago, who presents from home with anemia below 
his baseline of ___. He was having routine bloodwork with PCP 
at ___ and noted h/h had downtrended 
to 6.8/22.7, and was referred to ED. While his blood was being 
drawn at the outside facility, he noticed some vision changes 
that he does not recall having before.

In the ED, initial VS were T 98.1 HR 62 BP 110/67 RR 15 O2 sat 
100% RA. No notable exam findings. Labs showed Hgb 5.9, Hct 
20.8, MCV 91, WBC 3.9, ___ 25.9, INR 2.4. After transfusion with 
1 unit PRBC, his Hgb was 6.6, Hct 21.9, WBC normalized to 5.3, 
and he was admitted to medicine for further management.  

On the floor, he is not in any distress. He states that he has 
been feeling well lately, notes no particular fatigue, 
lightheadedness, or chest pain. He states that he can normally 
walk over a block without getting short of breath. Recently, in

He is not aware of any known etiology of his anemia, but when 
asked what he thinks might have caused his anemia, he stated 
that he has recently started Depakote two weeks ago and wonders 
whether it could be contributory. 

Of note, he was hospitalized two weeks ago for encephalopathy 
due to lithium toxicity. He was also previously admitted in 
___ for bradycardia requiring pacemaker placement (after 
failed cardioversion on ___ from A-fib to NSR). This course 
was complicated by possible R embolic stroke, though he

cardioversion, metastatic colorectal cancer to liver s/p 
colectomy, papillary thyroid cancer s/p thyroid lobectomy, grade 
1 pancreatic NET, and recent right-sided frontal embolic stroke, 
who presents from home with anemia below his baseline of ___.

#Metastatic colorectal cancer s/p colectomy:
#Normocytic Anemia:
The patient presented with a Hb of 5.9 from a baseline of ___. 
The patient received 2U pRBCs. Stool was initially guaiac 
positive, then resulted negative. Iron studies showed iron 
deficiency. CT abdomen showed no signs of retroperitoneal bleed, 
but large exophytic liver mass with concern for erosion into 
bowel. Hematology-Oncology was consulted given concern for 
bleeding from active malignancy. GI was consulted and performed 
endoscopy/colonoscopy revealing mass eroding into the duodenum 
which was likely source of bleeding. Biopsies were taken and 
pathology should be followed-up in clinic. Radiation oncology 
and hepatobilliary surgery were consulted and intervention was 
deferred due to operative risk and risk of radiation necrosis. 
The patient should follow-up with oncology for further 
treatment. He received 1U pRBCs ___ and he should have 
repeat CBC drawn on ___. He has a functional tunneled port.

#Atrial Fibrillation s/p PPM:
The patient remained hemodynamically stable with heart rates 
under control. His Coumadin was stopped and he was put on a 
heparin drip for his GI procedures. He was then continued on 
anticoagulation with lovenox. Cardiology was consulted as the 
patient was anxious about his pacemaker, and team decision was 
that lovenox would be the best anticoagulation strategy going 
forward. He should have repeat CBC as above for ongoing 
bleeding. 

#HFpEF:
EF 50-55% in ___. Remained euvolemic during hostpialization. 
Torsemide was held given continued bleeding.

#Bipolar: 
Continued Depakote. Valproate level 28. No evidence of mood 
dysregulation. Follow-up in clinic with adjustment of Depakote 
dose as appropriate. 

#Metastatic colorectal cancer to liver s/p colectomy
#Papillary thyroid cancer s/p thyroid lobectomy
#Grade 1 pancreatic NET
The patient should follow-up with oncology for management of 
metastatic colon cancer as above. He should see genetics in the 
outpatient setting for workup of possible Multiple Endocrine 
Neoplasia. Home levothyroxine was continued.

#Recent R frontal stroke: 
Stable without overt sequellae. Given ongoing H/H drop requiring 
pRBC transfusion, decision was made to use lovenox monotherapy. 
He should have repeat CBC as above for ongoing bleeding. 

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
- GI biopsies were taken and pathology should be followed-up in 
clinic
- Follow-up with oncology for further treatment.
- Discharged on lovenox monotherapy (Coumadin discontinued as 
above).
- Outpatient labs: repeat CBC on ___. Fax to PCP and 
oncology. Would recommend consideration of RBC transfusion for 
Hb<7.
- Torsemide was held given continued bleeding.
- Valproate level 28. Follow-up in clinic with adjustment of 
Depakote dose as appropriate.
- Recommend genetics in the outpatient setting for workup of 
possible Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia.
- Tunneled port will need to be flushed every ___ weeks

IMAGING

MRI Pelvis ___

Interval decrease in size of previous large mid/lower rectal 
tumor now 
extending beyond the mesorectal fascia on the right, abutting 
the 
circumferential resection margin with new involvement of the 
right levator ani 
muscle.  Mesorectal lymph nodes have decreased in size, all 
measuring less 
than or equal to 5 mm. 
  
Overall imaging stage:  T4b N1.  Please refer to the PET/CT 
performed on 15 

CT Chest ___

1.  7 mm right lower lobe nodule, stable since ___.  This 
is concerning 
for metastatic disease. 
2.  Hypodense nodule in or just posterior to the remnant left 
lobe of thyroid. 
3.  Moderate cardiomegaly. 
4.  Moderate hiatal hernia. 
  
CT A/P ___

1. Rectal mass appears grossly unchanged in size. Increased 
attenuation of the 
seminal vesicles on the right, unclear if this is due to rectal 
mass invasion 
or streak artifact from adjacent hip prosthesis. 
2. Decreased size of perirectal lymph nodes. 
3. Segment 6 hepatic lesion is increased in size compared to 
prior MRI, which 
may be accentuated by difference in modality, although still 
concerning for 
metastatic disease. 
4. Additional infiltrating lesion surrounding the left central 
intrahepatic 
bile ducts with proximal biliary dilatation is again seen. 
5. Heterogeneous pancreatic lesion in the head/uncinate (vs 
multiple adjacent 
low-density lesions) is grossly unchanged, concerning for 
metastatic disease. 
There is a persistently enlarged retroperitoneal lymph node 
adjacent to the 
pancreatic head. 
6. Mild nonspecific circumferential bladder wall thickening. 

___ regarding assessment for metastase 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ underwent a laparoscopic abdominoperineal resection 
and placement of fiducials on ___ for surgical treatment of 
his rectal cancer. He tolerated the procedure well and was 
transferred to the PACU in stable conditon. Please see the op 
note for technical details. Immediately postop, his pain was 
controlled with a dPCA and he was started on a diet of sips. He 
was also placed on perineal precautions and given an air 
matress. By POD#2, he was tolerating a diet of clears so he was 
placed on oral pain medications. By POD#3, he was tolerating a 
regular diet and ambulating. However, due to continued problems 
with incontinence his foley was kept in for his entire 
hospitalization. By POD #4, his pain was controlled on PO pain 
meds, his ostomy was working, he was ambulating and tolerating a 
regualr diet so he was discharged home with services for his new 
ostomy and his foley catheter.

***MICU Course ___
___ with ___ s/p cardioversion ___, metastatic 
colorectal cancer to liver, papillary thyroid cancer s/p 
lobectomy, grade 1 pancreatic NET, bipolar d/o now presenting 
with neurologic findings and bradycardia.
#Bradycardia:
Unclear etiology. Per cardiology he may have ___ 
bradycardia. He also has underlying RBBB and LAFB raising 
possibility of conduction disease. No symptoms and initial 
troponin negative reassuring against MI. He received atropine 
and dopamine gtt in the ED. Given acute urine retention, may 
also be related to increased vagal tone. Elevated lithium levels 
may also cause bradyarrhythmia.  He was initiated on dopamine 
which provided improvement in HR's.  He was then trialed off 
dopamine and had sustained rates in the ___.  EP was consulted 
and recommended 24 hours off dopamine to eval HR.  He did take 
metoprolol morning of ___.
#Neurologic deficits:
He had question of new neurologic findings, though in retrospect 
these may have been intermittent. Per neurology his language and 
left sided weakness deficits could be due to multifocal embolic 
strokes. He does have history of multiple neoplasms.  Neurology 
consulted and recommended imaging studies for evaluation. 
#Afib: on Coumadin, pt INR supratherapeutic on admission so AC 
held.

CCU COURSE:
___ with ___ s/p cardioversion ___, metastatic 
colorectal cancer to liver, HFpEF and bipolar d/o now presenting 
with bradycardia I/s/o conduction disease and possible change in 
mental status, admitted to CCU for monitoring of bradycardia x 
24 hours after discontinuation of dopamine gtt. Now s/p ___ 
pacemaker placement with improvement of bradycardia. 

# Bradycardia: 
The patient presented with bradycardia of unclear etiology; 
could be ___ bradycardia vs. conduction disease 
given underlying RBBB and LAFB. No anginal symptoms and

subsequently stable. Pacemaker was placed. Beta blockade was 
held given bradycardia, then restarted on discharge. The patient 
was discharged for a ___ course of Keflex.

# R Frontal stroke:
# Neurologic deficits: 
No focal symptoms on CCU admission, possibly transient ischemia 
i/s/o bradycardia. MRI showing acute R frontal stroke, but 
neurology of opinion that this does not explain clinical 
picture. The patient should continue anticoagulation 
indefinitely for secondary stroke. LDL was 74. Would recommend 
treatment including statin to optimize LDL<100. A1C was 4.7. The 
patient should ___ in the stroke clinic in ___ months.

# ___: S/P cardioversion ___. Now in NSR with rare bursts 
of PAF. Metoprolol resumed on discharge. Warfarin was held, then
