___ 11:14AM   PLT COUNT-___ with hx 2 csections, who presented to ___ with 3 weeks of 
intermittent RUQ pain. RUQ US revealed cholelithiasis and sludge 
without other evidence of acute
cholecystitis. LFTS and WBC were normal.  The patient was kept 
NPO, started on IVF for hydration and received IV antibiotics.  
She was consented for laparoscopic cholecystectomy for 
symptomatic Cholelithiasis. On HD2, the patient was taken to the 
operating room and she underwent laparoscopic cholecystectomy, 
which went well without complication (reader referred to the 
Operative Note for details). After a brief, uneventful stay in 
the PACU, the patient arrived on the floor on IV fluids, and 
acetaminophen, tramadol and oxycodone for pain control.  The 
patient was hemodynamically stable.

Pain was well controlled. Diet was progressively advanced as 
tolerated to a regular diet with good tolerability. The patient 
voided without problem. During this hospitalization, the patient 
ambulated early and frequently, was adherent with respiratory 
toilet and incentive spirometry, and actively participated in 
the plan of care. The patient received subcutaneous heparin and 
venodyne boots were used during this stay.

At the time of discharge, the patient was doing well, afebrile 
with stable vital signs. The patient was tolerating a regular 
diet, ambulating, voiding without assistance, and pain was well 
controlled.  The patient was discharged home without services. 
The patient received discharge teaching and follow-up 
instructions with understanding verbalized and agreement with 
the discharge plan.

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted to the hospital with abdominal pain.  You had 
an ultrasound which showed gallstones within your gallbladder 
which were thought to contribute to your episodes of pain.  You 
were taken to the operating room and were found to have acute 
inflammation of your gallbladder.  Your gallbladder was removed 
laparoscopically and this procedure went well.  You are now 
tolerating a regular diet and are ready to be discharged home to 
continue your recovery.

Please follow the discharge instructions below:

Please follow up in the Acute Care Surgery clinic at the 
appointment listed below.
 
ACTIVITY:
 
o Do not drive until you have stopped taking pain medicine and 
feel you could respond in an emergency.
o You may climb stairs. 
o  You may go outside, but avoid traveling long distances until 
you see your surgeon at your next visit.
o  Don't lift more than ___ lbs for 4 weeks. (This is about 
the weight of a briefcase or a bag of groceries.) This applies 
to lifting children, but they may sit on your lap.
o You may start some light exercise when you feel comfortable.
o You will need to stay out of bathtubs or swimming pools for a 
time while your incision is healing. Ask your doctor when you 
can resume tub baths or swimming.
 
HOW YOU MAY FEEL: 
o  You may feel weak or "washed out" for a couple of weeks. You 
might want to nap often. Simple tasks may exhaust you.
o  You may have a sore throat because of a tube that was in your 
throat during surgery.
o  You might have trouble concentrating or difficulty sleeping. 
You might feel somewhat depressed.
o  You could have a poor appetite for a while. Food may seem 
unappealing.
o  All of these feelings and reactions are normal and should go 
away in a short time.  If they do not, tell your surgeon.
 
YOUR INCISION:
o Tomorrow you may shower and remove the gauzes over your 
incisions. Under these dressing you have small plastic bandages 
called steri-strips. Do not remove steri-strips for 2 weeks. 
(These are the thin paper strips that might be on your 
incision.) But if they fall off before that that's okay).
o Your incisions may be slightly red around the stitches. This 
is normal.
o You may gently wash away dried material around your incision.
o Avoid direct sun exposure to the incision area.
o Do not use any ointments on the incision unless you were told 
otherwise.
o You may see a small amount of clear or light red fluid 
staining your dressing or clothes. If the staining is severe, 
please call your surgeon.
o You may shower. As noted above, ask your doctor when you may 
resume tub baths or swimming.
 
YOUR BOWELS:
o Constipation is a common side effect of narcotic pain 
medications. If needed, you may take a stool softener (such as 
Colace, one capsule) or gentle laxative (such as milk of 
magnesia, 1 tbs) twice a day. You can get both of these 
medicines without a prescription.
o If you go 48 hours without a bowel movement, or have pain 
moving the bowels, call your surgeon. 
 
PAIN MANAGEMENT:
o It is normal to feel some discomfort/pain following abdominal 
surgery. This pain is often described as "soreness". 
o Your pain should get better day by day. If you find the pain 
is getting worse instead of better, please contact your surgeon.
o You will receive a prescription for pain medicine to take by 
mouth. It is important to take this medicine as directed. o Do 
not take it more frequently than prescribed. Do not take more 
medicine at one time than prescribed.
o Your pain medicine will work better if you take it before your 
pain gets too severe.
o Talk with your surgeon about how long you will need to take 
prescription pain medicine. Please don't take any other pain 
medicine, including non-prescription pain medicine, unless your 
surgeon has said its okay.
o If you are experiencing no pain, it is okay to skip a dose of 
pain medicine.

cough or when you are doing your deep breathing exercises.
