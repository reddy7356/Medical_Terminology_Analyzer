red blood with bowel your please seek medical attention. If you

If you are taking narcotic pain medications there is a risk that

time and you may experience urgency or small amounts of 
incontinence however this should improve. If you do not show 
improvement in these symptoms within ___ days please call the

advice. If you have any of the following symptoms please call 
the office for advice or go to the emergency room if severe: 
increasing abdominal distension, increasing abdominal pain, 
nausea, vomiting, inability to tolerate food or liquids, 
prolonged loose stool, or constipation.  
 
You have a small wound where the old ileostomy once was. This 
should be covered with a dry sterile gauze dressing. The wound 
no longer requires packing with gauze packing strip. Please 
monitor the incision for signs and symptoms of infection 
including: increasing redness at the incision, opening of the 
incision, increased pain at the incision line, draining of 
white/green/yellow/foul smelling drainage, or if you develop a 
fever. Please call the office if you develop these symptoms or 
go to the emergency room if the symptoms are severe. You may 
shower, let the warm water run over the wound line and pat the 
area dry with a towel, do not rub. Please apply a new gauze 
dressing after showering.  
 
No heavy lifting for at least 6 weeks after surgery unless

INTERPRETATION: ___ yo man with HL and h/o colorectal cancer and

atypical chest
discomfort associated with chemotherapy that has occurred over 
the past
month. The patient completed 7.5 minutes of ___ protocol
representing an average exercise tolerance; ~ ___ METS. The 
exercise
test was stopped due to fatigue. At peak exercise the patient 
reported
an abrupt-onset ___ "band-like pain" surrounding his upper and 
lower
abdominal nearly identical to the discomfort that occurs with
chemotherapy in both intensity and duration. This discomfort 
resolved
quickly post-exercise and was absent by 2 minutes of recovery. 
No
significant ST segment changes were noted during the procedure. 
The
rhythm was sinus with no ectopy noted. The hemodynamic response 
to
exercise was appropriate.
 
IMPRESSION: Average exercise tolerance. Atypical symptoms 
(identical to
those reported while undergoing chemotherapy) in the absence of 
ischemic
ST segment changes. Appropriate hemodynamic response to 
exercise.
 
Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ is a ___ year old gentleman with a history of 
rectal cancer on chemotherapy who had an episode of upper 
abdominal pain and right lower quadrant chest pain in a band 
like distribution during chemotherapy. 

Given concern for vasospasm vs. ACS, he was admitted to ___ 
for further workup. Troponins were negative x3 and there were no 
EKG changes. He underwent an exercise stress test for risk 
stratification. He experienced recurrence of abdominal pain 
during the stress test, though there were no EKG changes. Given 
low suspicion for ACS and the risk/benefit profile of pursuing 
more invasive interventions, a cardiac catheterization was not 
pursued. 

He is scheduled for an outpatient coronary CT to evaluate for 
coronary calcifications. This was communicated to his 
Oncologist.

ACTIVE ISSUES:

# Chest pain: Pt presents with chest pain in the setting of ___ 
infusion without concerning EKG findings or troponin elevation 
to suggest ACS. No history of CAD with normal stress test in 
___, however some concern for ___ induced coronary vasospasm.

did result in reproduction of patient's pain at peak exercise. 
Patient will undergo further workup, beginning with a CTA of the 
coronary arteries as an outpatient. 
 
# Colorectal cancer: Had just started Cycle #2 of modified 
FOLFOX when patient experienced symptoms. Per primary 
oncologist, Dr. ___ his coronary arteries are clear, a
