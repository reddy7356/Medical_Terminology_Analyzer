Brief Hospital Course:
  
#. Pain: Patient has a history of multiple pain crisis and is on 
on chronic pain meds. She presented with 1 day of pain after 
reportedly running out of her long acting narcotics on the day 
prior to admission. Initially her pain was thought to be due to 
sickle cell crisis as she had a history consistent with this, 
with a component of running out of pain medication. She was 
given IVF and restarted on he home pain regimen. On HD 2 her 
pain was under much better control and it was discovered that 
the patient had just been discharged, 2 days prior, for pain 
crisis. It was concluded that the reason for her pain was the 
lack of long acting pain medications and she was discharge with 
a prescription to receive these.    
 
#. Fever: Patient reported fevers at home up to 101. No signs of 
infection were found as WBC 6.3, Tmax 99.5, nl CXR and UA (-). 
She remained afebrile throughout admission. This may have been 
due to ongoing viral infection (see below).

#. Lip lession: Patient was found to have a lip lession on 
admission. This was thought to be due to herpes simplex virus. 
She was started on acyclovir and given a prescription to finish 
a 5 day course of this medication.

RADIOLOGY REPORTS:
CHEST X-RAY 2 VIEWS: ___
FINDINGS: Lung volumes are diminished. No edema is noted. Subtle 
increased 
density noted in retrocardiac left lower lobe. A right internal 
jugular approach Port-A-Cath is again present in stable course 
and position. Mediastinum is otherwise unremarkable. The cardiac 
silhouette is borderline enlarged but stable. No effusion or 
pneumothorax is noted. The visualized osseous structures are 
unremarkable. 
  
IMPRESSION: Low lung volumes with bronchovascular crowding. Left 
lower lobe opacity may reflect atelectasis although an early 
developing pneumonia is not excluded. Port-A-Cath stable. 

Left Upper Extremity Doppler U/S: No evidence of DVT
 
Brief Hospital Course:
ASSESSMENT:
___ y.o. Female with h.o. SCD, Borderline PD, P.E. on Coumadin, 
?conversion d.o. admitted with SOB, chest pain thought to be ___ 
sickle cell disease versus supratentorial, active suicidal 
ideation.

##. Chest Tightness: Ms. ___ was admitted to ___ after 
leaving the ___ Unit against medical advice. The 
cause of her chest pain was unclear given her history of sickle 
cell disease as well as conversion disorder. An EKG showed 
normal sinus rhythm with no acute ST changes. Sickle cell labs 
did not show an elevated total bilirubin however her LDH was 
mildly elevated. Given her sickle cell history and mildly 
elevated LDH she was treated for sickle cell crisis with 
intravenous fluid, hydroxyurea. She was also given a one unit 
blood transfusion for a low Hct of 19 (her admission Hct was 21 
likely from her recent history of hemorrhaging following the 
therapeutic abortion). She was initially treated with IV 
Dilaudid 1mg diluted in 50cc of normal saline run over 30 
minutes every 3 hours. She was then transitioned to her previous 
PO regimen of Dilaudid. There were several times when Ms. ___ 
stated she was in pain however her pain was easily resolved with 
distraction. Given her history od hiding and cheeking her pills 
her Dilaudid medication was given crushed. The patient had also 
admitted endorsing saving her pain medications so she could take 
them all together in an attempt at suicide. It is also possible 
that her chest pain was due to her history of hyperanalgesia and 
conversion disorder, however given her medical history this 
author felt it would be difficult to truly rule out a sickle 
cell crisis. She did not present with any acute chest syndrome 
symptoms.

##. ?Pneumonia: On admission Ms. ___ stated that she had 
fevers and several days of green sputum which mirrors to the 
exact word her previous presentations every year since ___. A 
Chest xray was obtained in the ED which showed some lower lobe 
opacification which was likely atelectasis however an early 
infiltrate could not be excluded. Her subjective symptoms are 
difficult to interpret given her conversion disorder history. 
She presented with no leukocytosis and her pulmonary exam was 
clear to auscultation. However given the opacification for which 
an infection could not be ruled out, her reported symptoms and 
her susceptibility to Mycoplasma and Legionella from her sickle 
cell disease this author thought it prudent to treat her. She 
completed a 5 day course of Levofloxacin.

##. Aggressive behaviour/Suicidal Ideation: Psychiatry were 
consulted upon patient admission as pt was noted to be very 
tearful and requested psychiatry see her. Initially she told 
psychiatry that she had issues with feeling angry and wanting to 
be aggressive. She was thus moved to a private room with 1:1 
sitter and was started on Risperidone 2mg BID. She also endorsed 
some auditory hallucinations of her father and grandmother 
telling her it would be better for her to die. On her third day 
of hospitalization she then endorsed first passive suicidal 
ideation stating she felt like she should just die; and then 
active suicidal ideation. She was considering jumping out the 
window, she asked the nurses to take away the plastic bin liners 
as she felt like suffocating herself with them. Psychiatry 
continued to follow the patient in house, the sitter was also 
continued and all bin liners were removed from her room. She is 
going to be transferred back to the ___ on a ___. 

## History of pulmonary embolism: Patient on admission was noted 
to be mildly subtherapeutic on her Coumadin with an INR of 1.9. 
She does have a history of cheeking her Coumadin medication, per 
the patients family members the ___ had been held 
previously as she had some hemorrhaging following a therapeutic 
abortion. Whilst in the hospital she received 1 day of bridiging 
with Lovenox until her INR was above 2.0. She was discharged on 
her usual dose of 5mg Coumadin, with her goal INR needing to be 
ranging from 2 to 3. 

## Anemia: Upon admission Ms. ___ was noted to have a Hct of 
25 which trended down to 21 and 19. Per her sister she was noted 
to have a recent history of bleeding following a therapeutic 
abortion. In the ED her guaiacs were negative showing no blood 
in her stool, the decrease in her Hct was likely due to 
hemodilution as she was given fluid for her sickle cell crisis. 
She received one unit of red blood cells with a subsequent Hct 
of 26 which remained stable prior to discharge.

## Seizure disorder: She was also noted to have a subtherapeutic 
Dilantin level of 0.9, she states her dilantin was recently 
increased from BID to TID. I suspect she may not be adherent to 
this medication given the high dose of Dilantin 200mg TID. She 
was reloaded with Dilantin and continued on Dilantin 200mg TID; 
prior to discharge her Dilantin dose was reduced to 200mg BID. 
She will need to have a Dilantin checked on ___ and 
___ to ensure she is maintained at a goal level of 10 to 
20. Would recommend then continuing to check daily Dilantin 
levels until she is stabilized with a level between 10 and 20.

## Asthma: She was continued on her home regimen of fluticasone, 
albuterol MDI as needed.

questioned. 

Bilateral hips xray:
IMPRESSION: 
No evidence of acute process involving the bilateral hips or 
pelvis. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
# Left leg pain: Patient received IV Vancomycin and ceftriaxone 
on arrival for treatment of a mild cellulitis in a patient with 
sickle cell disease.  Her exam was unconcerning, however, for 
significant infection either at the left leg or neck.  Work-up 
was otherwise non-revealing and showed no evidence of pneumonia, 
abdominal infection, acute chest or other concerns.  She was 
transitioned to PO doxycycline and she was afebrile for the 
entirety of her hospital stay.  Plan on discharge was for a 
short 7-day course of doxycycline to cover the cellulitis.  The 
presumption was that having been given broad spectrum 
antibiotics on arrival, her exam was not entirely reliable.  As 
a result, it was felt that a short course of antibiotics would 
be the most reasonable option although her exam was nearly 
entirely benign at the time of discharge.  Rehospitalization for 
this issue would be necessary if the leg becomes significantly 
more erythematous, swollen, fluctuant, painful or fevers >101.5 
occur; otherwise, this can be monitored as an outpatient.  The 
mild phlebitis at the neck appeared to have been apporpriately 
treated with the previous 5 day course of clindamycin.
.
# Dehydration: the patient was rehydrated, and PO intake was 
encouraged
.
# Fever: Afebrile on discharge
.
# Soft stool: Per patient, not diarrhea, but if she were to 
develop diarrhea/watery stools, would be concerned about 
possible C. Diff infection, given she was on a recent course of 
clindamycin. No clinical evidence for this type of infection at 
this point.  Stool studies for C. Diff could confirm this 
diagnosis, and treatment would consist of oral metronidazole and 
cessation of any antibiotics as soon as possible.
.
# Suicidal ideation: Psychiatry saw the patient and felt that 
she would be best to return to her group home for outpatient 
psychiatric care.
.
# Pain control: Patient was on her home pain regimen for the 24 
hours prior to discharge, and this was adequate.
.
# Seizure: no evidence of seizure on this admission, continued 
on home phenytoin.  Continue to monitor levels regularly.
.
# Anticoagulation; INR 2.2, so 5mg coumadin continued; INR 
checks difficult to do due to patient cooperation. Please f/u 
INR on discharge.
.
# Sickle Cell: Given clear chest x-ray and 100% oxygen 
saturation on room air, and no evidence on physical exam, acute 
chest pain crisis was ruled out.

pain medications, she was able to ambulate without difficulty, 
tolerating oral intake and considered medically stable for 
discharge. 

 
Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted to ___ with pain, likely secondary to a 
sickle cell crisis.  We think that your sickle cell crisis was 
likely induced by a viral infection that caused you to take in 
less fluids, making you dehydrated and precipitated your sickle 
cell crisis.  We treated your pain  crisis initially with IV 
pain medications, and once the pain was well controlled we 
transitioned you to oral pain medications.  Also, you had 
complained of increased pain in your right groin, for which we 
did an ultrasound that showed no DVT but an enlarge lymph node.  
We also found that the levels of your seizure medications were 
low, so we repleted the levels and increased your dose of 
phenytoin. 

Changes made to your medication regimen: 
1. Phenytoin dose increased to 250mg twice a day 
2. We discontinued your lovenox since your INR was in the 
correct range for your coumadin
3.  We added a short course of dilaudid ___ every 6 hours as 
needed for breakthrough pain 
4. As per ___ clinic your coumadin dose has changed, take 
5mg tonight and alternate with 7.5mg every other day until you 
have gotten your INR checked and follow up with ___ clinic. 
 

Please call your doctor or return to the hospital if you 
experience fever or chills, chest pain, shortness of breath, 
pain similar to your sickle cell crises, are unable to take your 
seizure medications or any other concerning symptoms.

Imaging:

CXR
No significant change from prior study or evidence of acute 
intrathoracic 
process. 

Ultrasound of Neck
Soft tissue edema involving the right (?left) soft tissues of 
the neck without evidence of focal fluid collection suggestive 
of abscess. No pathologically enlarged lymph nodes identified. 

CT Neck
IMPRESSION: 
1. Multiple scattered symmetric cervical lymph nodes, the 
largest of which is located within the submandibular region with 
prominent symmetric 1.5 cm in transverse diameter submandibular 
lymph nodes. 
2. No discrete mass identified. 
3. No abnormal fluid collection that will be concerning for 
abscess. 
NOTE ADDED AT ATTENDING REVIEW: The soft tissue noted above on 
image 25 of 
series 2 are the submandibular glands, not lymph nodes. As such, 
the glands
are within normal size, and therefore not indicative of an 
abnormality. 
There is no evidence of enlarged lymph nodes. However, it is 
true that 
sensitivity for adenopathy is reduced without intravenous 
contrast. If there is ongoing concern for adenopathy or other 
evidence of infection, and MR of the neck may be helpful.  

 
Brief Hospital Course:
NECK CELLULITIS: On presentation, the patient was febrile and 
tachycardic, and there was initial concern for a deep neck 
infection. Further imaging and physical exam showed this not to 
be the case. Rather, she has a small area of cellulitis on her 
neck. She was empirically treated with vancomycin and 
clindamycin in the ED, but this was changed to oral clindamycin.

Because of recent sick contacts, complaint of sore throat, and 
monocytosis, a monospot was sent; it was negative. CMV IgG is 
positive, IgM is negative. EBV serologies are pending.

IMPRESSION:   
1. Stable right lower lobe emboli, compared to ___. 
No new 
filling defect to suggest acute emboli. 
  
2. Unchanged lung parenchyma scarring. 
  
3. Multiple stable prominent mesenteric lymph nodes mostly 
clustered around 
right lower quadrant in the pericecal region, also seen in ___. 

  
4. Atrophic shrunken spleen and hyperdense liver consistent with 
sickle cell 
disease. 
  
5. Right ovarian cyst measuring more than 3 cm. Followup 
ultrasound in six 
weeks to document resolution. 
  
6. Stable mild intra and extra hepatic biliary duct dilatation 
due to 
cholecystectomy. 

Chest X-ray (___)- 
FINDINGS: 
PICC terminates in the superior vena cava. The heart is mildly 
enlarged.  
Lungs are clear. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unremarkable. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
# Chest, arm pain: Patient has a history of this pain.  Current 
situation is consistent with previous pain crises.  There was no 
evidence of acute chest or PE on physical exam (pt is breathing 
comfortably on room air, no signs of respiratory distress).  The 
patient was continously hydrated with NS while inpatient.  She 
was monitored regularly for signs of fluid overload.  Her home 
pain medications of dilaudid 4mg and MS contin 60mg q8hrs were 
continued as an in-patient.  Patient only complained about pain 
when asked and regularly would not require doses for >12hrs. She 
was often demanding when it came to her medication regimen with 
the nurses.  ___ MS contin was switched to morphine ___ at an 
equivalent dose ( but she was discharged on MS contin given that 
is her home regimen).  In addition, all pain medications were 
crushed given that the patient was caught cheeking some 
medications during this admission.  Pain remained under control 
throughout her stay here.   
  
# Pulmonary embolus in ___- Patient has 
history of PE and DVT, including recently diagnosed PE at ___ in 
___.  Given that, she has been on coumadin as an 
outpatient and is followed at ___ clinic.  She has a 
history of being non-compliant with her coumadin.  Her INR on 
admission was 3.7 so her coumadin was initially held.  After 2 
days, INR dropped to 1.3 so coumadin was restarted at home dose 
of 5mg.  Her INR intially trended up (to 1.6) but then began 
trending down to 1.1.  Her dose was increased to 7.5mg daily.  
Despite this, INR kept trending down so the nurses began

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted to the hospital for chest pain.  Upon 
examination, it was determined that this pain was consistent 
with your previous pain crises due to your sickle cell disease.  
While here we gave you constant IV fluids, which you tolerated 
well.  In addition, you received your home regimen of pain 
medications.  Your coumadin was initially held because your INR 
was 3.7 on admission.  We monitored your INR closely and 
restarted your coumadin when it was safe.  While your INR was 
sub-therapeutic, you were started on a heparin drip for 
anti-coagulation.  We had a CT scan performed which did not show 
any new pulmonary embolus.  In addition, your EKG and cardiac 
enzymes did not show any signs of a heart attack.  Your INR 
became therapeutic so your heparin drip was stopped.  You 
tolerated your regular diet well and were able to ambulate 
without difficulty.  Upon discharge, you were stable with no 
complaints.

The following changes were made to your medications:
1.  Your folic acid was increased to 3mg by mouth day
2.  Please resume the rest of your home medications as they are 
prescribed by your primary care physician

Brief Hospital Course:
This is a ___ year old woman with sickle cell disease, PE and CVA 
(on chronic coumadin)and severe borderline personality disorder 
presenting with diffuse pain for the past ___ days. 
Acute issues:

1. Sickle cell crisis, with tachycardia and borderline 
hypoxemia:  On presentation the patient had a modestly elevated 
LDH and a somewhat lower Hct than baseline without any discrete 
local findings.  This was felt likely to be due to sickle cell 
crisis.  Presumed etiology was dehydration (given also with 
sinus tach and signs of dehydration) possibly exacerbated by a 
viral or other illness.  She was treated with fluids and oxygen 
and LDH fell steadily.  Fluids were stopped 24 hrs before 
discharge and she was encouraged to take PO foods with 
stability.  Hct stabilized and LDH in range of her best values 
here (mid ___.  She also had transient tachycardia and 
hypoxemia, as well as atypical chest pain, with no evidence of 
chest crisis.   

2. Diffuse Pain The patient reported diffuse pain on 
presentation presumed due to sickling in the context of 
dehydration.  This stabilized and improved slightly though 
continued to be significant, but patient does have chronic pain 
as noted by her long term opiate therapy. She had no signs of 
discrete arthritis or lesions.  She was initially treated on IV 
hydromorphone and reported severe pain but was quite somnolent.  
Therefore, she was treated back to oral hydromorphone regimen 
and pain manageable at time of discharge.  Her hydroxyurea was 
continued throughout admission.  Oral hydromorphone was 
increased relative to home doses for 1 week after discharge.  

3. Low grade fever: Pt had a low grade fever in the hospital but 
CXR without infiltrate and no clear localizing source of 
infection.  Blood cultures remained negative.  The patient had 
started a course of azithromycin prior to admission for ? 
pneumonia at that outside hospital and this was continued.  
Course was finished on ___ as this was at least day five 
of azithromycin treatment and the patient was discharged with 
her course completed.  If was felt far more likely patient 
actually had a viral infection but antibiotic course completed 
given vulnerability to infection in sickle cell patients with 
azithromycin. 

4. Abdominal Pain: The patient presented with abdominal pain in 
the context of her diffuse pain.  She was mildly tender but had 
no nausea or vomiting, was able to tolerate food, and initially 
refused RUQ U/S.  As she improved and this seemed to trend with 
her general pain picture as well as the fact LFT's improved RUQ 
was deferred.

5. Severe borderline personality disorder: Per previous psych 
notes pt with long history of severe affective instability, 
chronic compulsion to self harm, and occasional violent or 
aggressive outbursts.  Patient has been living in medical/mental 
health group home (___) recently but they did not know 
where she had gone when she eloped from ___.  On night of ___ 
patient called ___ to report thoughts of self harm (but 
had not reported this to anyone in the hospital).   ___ 
called our nursing station and nocturnist was informed who went 
and spoke to the patient who denied any desire to self harm but 
reports that she has thoughts of self harm when she is in pain 
or distress (consistent to what reported in psychiatry note of 
___.  She similarly denied any acute desire or plan to 
harm herself to her primary MD the following morning.  She was 
not felt to be actively suicidal.  Her behavioral and emotional 
lability actually seemed under relatively good control during 
this hospitalization.  Prior to discharge conversation was had 
with the staff of her group home who indicated she was close to 
her baseline.

Chronic issues:

1. History of PE/ CVA: She had no acute neurological changes.  
PE was entertained as a diagnosis of PE but thought extremely 
unlikely for reasons noted in discussion of that problem.  She 
was continued on coumadin and INR was therapeutic throughout her 
hospitalization.  INR 3.0 on admission, 3.3 on discharge.

2. Chronic stable asthma: No signs of acute reactive airway 
disease worsening.  She was continued on fluticasone.  

3.  GERD: She was continued on home omeprazole

4. Seizure disorder: She was continued on her home phenytoin for 
seizure disorder.

Brief Hospital Course:
1. Sickle cell disease/pain crisis
The patient presented with diffuse body pain, including all of 
her joints and her chest, most markedly.  Workup for acute chest 
syndrome was negative on 3 occasions (see above CXR reports).  
The patient was not transfused as she mainted her HCT >21.  
Hemolysis labs showed she was hemolyzing (retic count ~15, 
haptoglobin <20) with sickle cells evident on the peripheral 
smear.  She was aggressively hydrated with 200 cc/hour to 
150cc/hour for ___ days; her pain was initially controlled on IV 
dilaudid but she was switched to oral dilaudid with adequate 
pain control approximately 4 days prior to discharge.  Pain was 
also controlled with tylenol and ibuprofen.  Antiemetics were 
provided for nausea, folic acid was continued, and supplemental 
oxygen was provided.  However, her O2 sat was >93% for the 
majority of her hospitalization.  Her pain improved and 24 hours 
prior to discharge she required a decreased amount of dilaudid 
(6 mg) compared to 8 mg IV per 24 hour period when she was 
initially admitted. 
.
Per ___ hematologists, Dr. ___ Dr. ___ 
does definitely have sickle cell anemia.  One electrophoresis 
was completed at ___ ___ showed a falsely elevated 
HgbA (53.1%) after transfusion and she was incorrectly thought 
to have sickle cell trait.  A repeat electrophoresis at ___ 
confirmed sickle cell disease. The last electrophoresis at 
___ (___) showed HgbA 9%, HgbA2 2.5%, HgbF 33.9%, HgS 
54.6%, which was compatible with SS homozygote. Per her primary 
hermatologist, her last crisis was 2.5 months ago.  The patient 
had been off hydrea as an outpatient as last HgF was 33.9% at 
___ on ___ and it was unclear if patient would benefit 
from further elevation of HbF to ___ serum hemoglobin level.  A 
hemoglobin F level was pending upon discharge.  The patient may 
benefit from  restarting hydroxyurea if the hemoglobin F level 
is decreased.  The ___ laboratory may be reached at 
___ to followup this result.
.
2. Left-sided hemiparesis (improving).
CVA rule out on ___ a code stroke was called and all imaging 
was negative for CVA.  Neurology consults, psychiatry 
consultants, and the primary team felt that the presentation was 
consistent with the patient's long h/o malingering.  Unlikely 
that L-sided hemiparesis represents ___ paralysis as it has 
persisted now >24 hours.  Also on physical exam, when examining 
L-sided weakness patient protects face when hand dropped over 
face, i.e. hand does not fall in gravity-dependent fashion. 
Therefore, it is felt that the hemiparesis likely has some 
psychiatric overlay.   Munchausen's has been documented by the 
patient's psychiatrist (Dr. ___ at ___) per 
Dr. ___ (___) her internist at ___ 
___.  Per psych eval this hospitalization, 
malingering vs. factitous d/o was thought to be the underlying 
etiology of her presentation.  The neuro exam was monitored 
closely with left-sided weakness improving daily.
.
3. Possible coagulase negative staphylococcus bacteremia with 
indwelling venous catheter
The patient had positive blood cultures (coagulase negative 
staph) from her port-a-cath, first at ___ (1 
culture from port-a-cath on ___.  For ___ 
cultures, bacteria sensitive to chlorampenicol, gentamicin, 
TMP-SMX, Tetracycline, and vancomycin. Repeat blood cultures 
from line at ___ on ___ growing Coagulase negative 
staphylococcus bacteremia on ___ and ___.  Per primary 
internist, patient has had port-a-cath for ___ years d/t 
frequent pain crises and poor access.  A course of vancomycin 
for 14 days was recommended.  She will complete the IV 
antibiotics on ___.  The plan was to treat the patient 
through the line infection (i.e. not remove port-a-cath) and 
monitor survellience blood cultures as the patient had no signs 
of a systemic infection and will need access given her current 
pain crises.  The ___ laboratory may be reached at 
___ to followup the pending blood cultures (see micro 
results above).  Note that a second blood culture (drawn from 
the port-a-cath) has grown coag neg staph as well - however the 
sensitivity profile suggests an alternate organism than 
initially isolated, thus likely to represent a contaminated 
blood culture sample.
.
4. Elevated LFTs: Elevated LFTs were possibly secondary to 
medications (eg dilantin) and trended down throughout the 
patient's hospitalization. Repeat HCV ab negative here.  Per OMR 
pt had negative HCV antibody ___ despite pt reporting h/o HCV.  
LFTs
should be followed closely and worked up as an outpatient.  Her 
LFT abnormalities were discussed with her primary internist at 
___.
.
5. Depression/Suicidality/Psychosis: Pt contracted for safety 
and denied SI/HI on this admission.  She has been hospitalized 
and ___ for depression/SI.  Risperadol per 
psych recs was begun for AH. 
.
6. PE: Pt has history of PE ___, she was discharged ___ on 
lovenox, not currently taking at psych facility. Per primary 
team at ___ scan was equivocol at ___ when PE was 
diagnosed. Subcutaneous heparin was continued throughout the 
patient's stay.
.
7. Asthma: Continue albuterol and fluticasone
.
8. Seizure disorder: Continue phenytoin, check level.
.
9.  FEN/Lytes: Regular diet, repleted lytes prn. IVF as above.

Brief Hospital Course:
This is a ___ year old patient with SS disease, multiple PEs on 
coumadin and hep C who presents with her typical sickle cell 
pain and with a subtherapeutic INR.  Despite these medical 
conditions, the most significant problem that the patient is 
battling is her mental illness which poses the greatest risk to 
her life.

1. SUICIDAL/Borderline personality discorder/PTSD: Psychiatry 
very involved with this patient's care including disposition 
planning.  The patient has a longstanding affective instability 
and inability to maintain herself safely in
the community.  She needs inpatient long term admission to 
intermediate care.  Dr. ___, ___ area medical director 
has made arrangements for her to go to the ___.  The 
patient threatened to "do something stupid" if she is 
transferred ___ to the ___.  She has a history of serious 
explosive and self-destructive behavior. The patient was 
discharged from the hospital to intermediate care at ___ 
___.  She is under ___.

During this admission, she had a 1:1 sitter given chronic 
suicidality and personality disorder with threats of burning the 
hospital and harming herself. Celexa and Remeron were continued.

A multidisciplinary meeting took place with Social Work, Case 
Management, Psychiatry, and Medicine teams to discuss how to 
manage future presentations to the ED.  Medicine team was asked 
to draft a "Flag" to be placed in the OMR for working the 
patient up in the ED to avoid unnecessary repeated medical 
admissions. This was to include input from Hematology and Pain 
services.  Pain service was not able to give input this 
admission because the patient was discharged prior to their 
evaluation.  Given the nature of the patient's complaints that 
usually involve Chest Pain in the setting of having sickle cell 
disease it will continue to be a challenge to quickly rule out 
an acute chest syndrome.  This should be readdressed if the 
patient is readmitted again to the hospital.
 
2. Whole body pain on Chronic pain: Recently ruled out for flu 
with DFA and viral cutlure. The patient was not febrile, had no 
abnormal vital signs, and no localizing signs of infection or 
other disease process. CXR did not reveal any acute process and 
UA was negative.  The patient may have hyperalgesia from chronic 
opiate use.

Please note that when asked what dose of medications she was 
prescribed, she reported all doses at double the dose that she 
was just recently prescribed from her recent discharge just days 
prior to this admission.  During this hospital admission she was 
ordered for her prior regimen of Morphine SR 30mg PO TID and 
Dilaudid 4mg PO Q4hrs for breakthrough, and Gabapentin. 
Benadryl/hydroxyzine and Sarna prn pruritis. For future 
admissions, pain consult should be considered.

3. Chest pain: There was no evidence for acute coronary syndrome 
or acute chest syndrome.  EKG and cardiac enzymes were negative. 
 There was no evidence of hemolysis and hematocrit remained 
stable.  Heparin (initially unfractionated, then changed to 
Lovenox) and Coumadin were started for chronic pulmonary 
embolism.

4. Chronic pulmonary embolism:  Pt has been known to cheek her 
medications or hide her pills.  Per psychiatry recommendations, 
her coumadin was ordered to be crushed and placed in food and 
she was to be observed while she took the coumadin.  INR was 
trending upward after this intervention.  The INR will be 
followed upon discharge and coumadin dose adjusted for a goal of 
___. Lovenox should be continued until INR>2.0.

5. Tachycardia: Patient had normal vital signs except when she 
became agitated when talking to psychiatry---at these times she 
had sinus tachycardia up to 120 BPM.

6. Sickle cell disease: Continue home dose of hydroxyurea and 
folate. She has a macrocytic anemia that is secondarely to 
reticulocytosis. She has normal folate and B12 levels. Her 
hematocrit was stable and remained at her baseline: 24. She will 
need to continue hydroxyurea and regular outpatient follow up 
with hematology.
  
7. Seizure disorder: Stable. Continue dilantin.  
 
8. Asthma: Stable, continue albuterol/flovent prn

disorder
3. Chronic pulmonary embolus with sub-therapeutic INR.

Secondary diagnosis:
1. Sickle cell disease
 
Discharge Condition:
Stable, tolerating PO, ambulatory, chronically suicidal
 
Discharge Instructions:
You were seen a the ___ for whole body pain and self-reported 
fever. You had EKG done that showed no changes and cardiac 
enzymes that were negative. You had no abnormalities on 
telemetry. You also had a chest xray that did not show signs of 
fluid overload or infection. Your Coumadin level (INR) was low 
upon admission, which may mean that you were not taken it 
correctly, the dose you have is low or changes in your diet as 
well as interactions with new medications. For this reason you 
required Lovenox for a few days.

You were ruled out for the flu on ___ with a negative nasal 
swab and you were afebrile during that admission. We called 
___, who did not report any measured temperature and during 
your stay here you were afebrile without any signs of infection. 
Your WBC were within normal range.

We also checked your blood level, which was at its baseline. 
Your folic acid and vitamin B12 levels are within normal limits 
and you need to continue those for your hemoglobin disorder. You 
did not have any signs of active sickle cell crisis.

You told us you were with the double of medications that we 
discharged you last week. We corroborated your list with 
___ and put you in your home regimen (see attached), which 
worked for your pain. The most likely explanation is withdrawal 
for the medications you were getting. You will need to slowly 
___ them down.

Given your chronic suicidality and chronic opioid use you were 
evaluated by our psychiatry group who recommended a structured 
environment for your protection.

Given that you have history of not taking your medications and 
hide them in multiple places we crushed all your medications, 
including your Coumadin.

History of Present Illness:
The patient is a ___ year-old woman with a history of sickle-cell 
disease, PE ___ year ago on Coumadin, borderline personality 
disorder and ? of possible seizure disorder who presents with 
left sided numbness and weakness.  According to the patient, 
this started roughly 2 days ago when she noticed intermittent 
left arm numbness.  She reports that the numbness would start at

with no ___, encompassing the entire leg all at once.  She 
reported these symptoms to the nurse, and was sent from her room 
in the ___ to their Urgent care clinic.  There she was also 
noted to have no movement of her left arm or leg (though it was 
unclear when this started, as the patient only complains of 
numbness on that side) so she was referred to ___ for further 
evaluation.  
.
Dr. ___ ___ who has 
been caring for the patient this past week reported that for the 
past week she has had a series of rather non-specific 
complaints.  Initially she mentioned a mild cough, however CXR 
and sputum sample were reported to be normal.  Later she

___ MR HEAD W/O CONTRAST FINDINGS: 
There is no acute infarct identified on diffusion images. There 
is no mass effect, midline shift, or hydrocephalus seen. The 
ventricles and cerebral sulci are normal in size. There is 
slight prominence of the 
cerebellar folia seen particularly at the inferior aspect of 
both cerebellar hemispheres, which are unchanged from previous 
study and indicate mild cerebellar atrophy. There is diffuse low 
signal in the bony structures including clivus, which is 
unchanged from prior study and could be related to patient's 
sickle cell disease given the clinical history on the prior 
study. 
IMPRESSION: No evidence of acute infarct. Mild cerebellar 
atrophy. Low signal within the bony structures could be related 
to sickle cell disease.
.
___ CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST FINDINGS: 
Non-contrast head CT was performed. There is no intra-axial or 
extra-axial hemorrhage, edema, shift of normally midline 
structures, or hydrocephalus. No evidence of acute major 
vascular territorial infarction. The included osseous structures 
appear intact. 
IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial process. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
Left Sided Numbness and Weakness: Neurology evaluated the 
patient and found that the patient's constellation of symptoms 
was non-physiologic, and found evidence of a factitious exam 
with provocation.  Their assessment was that the patient's 
symptoms were factitious. An MRI was obtained which did not show 
any evidence of an ischemic event. During the hospitalization, 
she was observed to spontaneously move her left side in greeting 
a favorite sitter, and this morning raised her left hand to me 
when making a point about wanting IM pain meds, despite her 
assertions that she is unable to move her left arm.

Psychiatry was consulted, and they agreed that the patient's 
neurologic complaints were of psychiatric etiology, and may 
represent a combination of conversion disorder, factitious 
disorder, and malingering.  They felt that her depression and 
suicidality were stable, but with very concerning features and 
they recommended a 24 hour sitter for the duration of the 
hospitalization. 
.
?Chest Pain: EKG was checked in the ED and is unchanged, they 
felt that CTA was not indicated as the patient was not 
tachycardic and not desaturating.  CXR was checked and showed no 
infection.  Per history this is similar to her prior sickle 
crises.  Per prior note a "flag" was supposed to be formulated 
about this complaint as the patient does this on a regular basis 
and it is often factitious.  There is a safety alert that 
indicates the same.  She was hydrated with ___.  We 
continued her home pain regimen, and did not escalate as we were 
concerned that she may opiate induced hyperalgesia vs a 
psychiatric etiology of her complaints.
.
Sickle Cell Disease:  It remains somewhat unclear if the patient 
is actively sickling, though given her history of falsifying her 
symptoms, it is hard to parse out what pain is organic and what 
pain is supratentorial.  We maintained hydration and continued 
her home regimen.  We have asked that her CBC be checked at the 
accepting facility in followup.
.
Psychiatric history: Psychiatry was consulted and felt initially 
that she had increased suicidality, however one of our psych 
residents who knows her well felt that she is at baseline. 
Sitter was maintained throughout the hospitalization.  Her care 
was discussed with her providers at the ___ (including Dr. 
___, who know her very well, and it was agreed that it 
was in the patient's best interest for her to be transferred to 
the ___, as continuity of care is particularly important 
for this patient.  Her home remerron and celexa were continued.

.
EKG: Sinus at 95, normal acis and intervals. S1Q3T3 present as 
before from ___. TWI V1-V5 also not new.  
.  
CXR ___ PA and lateral: compared to ___. Heart size 
is unchanged. Configuration suggests a mild prominence of the 
left ventricular contour and a double contour in the right heart 
shadow matches a prominent left atrial contour in posterior 
direction on the lateral view. Thus, at least moderate left 
atrial enlargement is present. A pulmonary vasculature has not 
undergone any significant interval change and is not congested 
presently. Lateral and posterior pleural sinuses are free and no 
acute infiltrates can be seen. No pneumothorax in the apical 
area. Thus chest appearance is unaltered since the preceding 
study of ___. When comparison is extended to a PA and lateral 
chest examination of ___, the heart shadow was slightly larger 
at that time and the pulmonary vasculature appeared slightly 
more prominent. These subtle variations suggest the possibility 
of acute cardiac problems of less acute level. All the EKG 
changes ? recommend cardiology consultation in this case with 
known sickle cell syndrome.
.  
___ Bilateral lower extremity doppler: no DVT
.
___ MRI/MRA Head:
FINDINGS: The sulci are prominent for the patient's age of ___ 
years. The 
ventricular system is normal in size and configuration without 
evidence of 
mass effect or shift of the normally midline structures. There 
is no evidence of restricted diffusion to suggest acute 
ischemia. There is an increase in flow voids overlying the 
cortex bilaterally which may represent prominent collaterals. 
The cerebral parenchyma demonstrates normal signal intensity on 
all imaging sequences. There is mucosal thickening of a few 
bilateral ethmoid air cells. 
  
The vertebral arteries are codominant. The internal carotid, 
anterior, 
middle, and posterior cerebral arteries are unremarkable. The 
anterior and 
posterior communicating arteries are visualized. There is no 
evidence of 
occlusion, stenosis, aneurysm, or arteriovenous malformation. 
  
The clivus demonstrates heterogenous bone marrow signal which 
may be secondary to underlying sickle cell disease. 
  
IMPRESSION: 
  
1. Mild diffuse volume loss for the patient's age of ___ years. 
  
2. Prominent leptomeningeal collaterals of undetermined 
significance. 
  
3. Otherwise, unremarkable MRI/MRA of the brain. 
.
Per Radiology (verbal communication): PICC line appropriately 
placed for use.
  

 
Brief Hospital Course:
In the ED, initial VS: 99.7 104 124/77 20 100RA. Her hematocrit 
was above her baseline at 27 but she did have a markedly 
elevated LDH. She was given dilaudid and benadryl (for itching 
associated with dilaudid). It was difficult to obtain IV access 
(pt has past history of several port-a-caths, last removed due 
to bacteremia). She eventually had a 22g IV placed. The ED 
wanted a CTA to eval for PE, but pt was unable to to get this 
due to inadequate IV access. She was given a dose lovenox as 
well as 1L IVF. A psych consult was called in the ED for SI. Pt 
is well known to their service and will frequently endorse SI 
during acute pain crises. They recommended a 1:1 sitter. At the 
time of transfer her VS: 99 115/60 95 19 98% RA. 
.
# Chest pain: Pt reported this was similar to prior pain crisis. 
She did not appear to be having acute chest crisis. No further 
imaging for PE was performed as it would not change management. 
Pt was given agressive IV hydration and pain control with home 
MS contin, IV dilaudid q3h PRN and IV benadryl for pruritis. She 
was continued on folic acid and hydroxyurea. Her pain regimen 
was adjusted over the course of her inpatient admission, but in 
the end continuation of her previous (pre-hospital) regimen of 
MS contin, and PRN PO dilaudid was the most effective.
.  
# PE -Pt with recurrent PEs, last dx ___. Started bridge to 
coumadin for last PE but coumadin decreased in setting of recent 
hospitalization for menorrhagia. INR was subtherapeutic at 
admission. Pt was bridged to coumadin with lovenox and INR at 
discharge was 2.3. On discharge she will take one more day of 
lovenox and then her bridge will be complete and she will 
continue on solely coumadin, with INR adjustment through the ___ 
___ clinic.
.
# Left sided weakness - pt c/o worsening L sided weakness. She 
has h/o R mini CVA with residual L weakness but stated it 
increased. Neuro was consulted to evaluate for stroke (full note 
in OMR). Although there was low suspicion for stroke, given pt's 
high risk and eqivocal exam, MRI/MRA was performed. This study 
was unremarkable for stroke.
.  
# Seizure d/o - Phenytoin level was subtherapeutic at admission; 
pt was continued on phenytoin.

# Borderline personality d/o - Suicidal ideation - Pt has h/o 
self injurious behavior and reported feeling that she "feels 
like dying" when in pain. When asked if she wanted to kill
