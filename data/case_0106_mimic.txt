Brief Hospital Course:
BRIEF HOSPITAL COURSE:
=====================
Ms. ___ is a ___ with h/o PE, stroke, dysphagia, vascular 
dementia, GERD, and chronic musculoskeletal chest pain presents 
with subacute hallucinations found to have urinary tract 
infection. Seen by psychiatry who believes the hallucinations 
are delirium from urinary tract infection exacerbating her 
baseline of dementia. 

ACUTE ISSUES: 
============= 
# Altered mental status
# UTI: 
Patient presents with worsening of altered mental status, 
dysuria and found to have UA concerning for UTI with culture 
growing pansensitive CITROBACTER KOSERI. She was treated with 3 
days of CTX which was narrowed to Bactrim for 2 additional days. 
Her mental status is further discussed below. 

# Worsening vascular dementia with psychotic features 
# Hx Stroke 
# Cognitive decline: 
Patient with worsening memory loss, along with hallucinations 
and paranoia with insomnia. She had been seen by Cognitive 
Neurology in the past and had trialed donepezil without 
improvement. Lexapro was also tried for concern for 
pseudodementia from depression without improvement. Metabolic 
causes of dementia were ruled out with negative RPR, B12, TSH, 
and HIV. Some concern for ___ Body Dementia given 
hallucinations and bradykinesia but no other parkinsonian 
features. She was seen by psychiatry who believes the 
hallucinations were consistent with delirium iso UTI on top of a 
baseline of dementia. The recommendations were to optimize her 
sleep wake cycle and was discharge on PO trazodone. She was care 
connected with Geriatrics to establish primary care given 
dementia. Her family currently feels safe taking care of her at 
home with her son and daughter in law.

Patient with evidence of wasting and also endorses significant 
weight loss although note that weights have been pretty 
consistent in the 170s over the last ___ years. She was seen by 
nutrition who recommended current diet with ensure x3. Continued 
multivitamin with minerals

# Bilateral ___ edema: 
Son endorses that patient has had increased lower extremity 
edema. No DVT on US. BNP, Albumin and TSH all unremarkable. 
Could be peripheral edema in setting of immobility or venous 
stasis 

CHRONIC ISSUES: 
=============== 
# PE: 
Per report, patient fell ill in ___ on arriving to the 
___ and was dx with a "clot in the lung and an old brain stroke". 
She was maintained on warfarin but then was lost to follow-up. 
Unclear if PE was provoked (may have been flight from ___ 
and MRI shows old stroke in left caudate nucleus. Given 
progressive cognitive decline and frailty on exam (difficulty 
with ambulation), risk of fall likely greater than risk of 
repeat PE. Coumadin discontinued ___, son in agreement. 
Son was counseled on warning signs of DVT/PE. 

# Cataract: 
S/p b/l surgery. Outpatient follow up with ophtho 

# GERD: 
Continued omeprazole 20 mg daily 

# Chronic musculoskeletal chest pain: 
Patient with multi-year hx of chest/back/shoulder/abd pain that 
is not associated with activity and is worse with palpation. 
Depression as contributor. Continued Tylenol prn 

# Dysphagia: 
Has had longstanding dysphagia (occurs predominantly while 
swallowing food. She does have occasional regurgitation) and 
underwent laryngoscopy in ___ which was thought to be 
consistent with GERD vs. Laryngopharyngeal reflux. She also has 
had a history of stroke but unclear what neurologic workup was 
done so unclear if she had residual dysphagia after stroke. She 
had been tolerating her pills and diet while inpatient. 

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
=====================

progressive dementia; case management might be reaching out as 
outpatient regarding ___ vs elder care services

[] Follow up with new Geriatrics PCP
[] Follow up with Cognitive Neurology (continuing to hold 
donepezil and Lexapro)
