minimal bleeding and
a significant amount of pus in the soft tissue. OR cultures grew 
Group B strep.  

She was transferred to ___ for concern for poor wound 
healing.  Vascular surgery was consulted.  ABI and duplex of the 
right lower extremities were performed and showed severe 
calcification with non compressible vessels concerning for 
tibial occlusive disease on the right. The right great toe 
pressure is 31 mm Hg.  

On ___, she underwent successful balloon angioplasty of the 
right anterior tibial artery.  Her right pedal pulses were 
palpable post procedure. On ___, her toe amputation was closed 
at the bedside. She will remain on augmentin for 10 days on 
discharge for the staph postivie wound culture from the 
operating room sample from the outside hospital. 

Her hospitalization was complicated by poor glycemic control. 
___ was consulted on ___ and adjusted pt's insulin
