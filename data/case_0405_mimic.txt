Brief Hospital Course:
Psychiatric:
Ms. ___ on presentation was frustrated and reported cognitive 
clouding and concern about having so many people looking at her. 
She did not have pressured speech or disorganized thought 
process and had no AVH or overt delusions. She was initially 
started on risperidone 1 mg PO on her first night, but in the 
morning she had low BP and was orthostatic, and had a syncopal 
episode described in more detail below, so risperidone was 
discontinued.

When she was medically stabilized, lamotrigine was increased to 
175 mg, and as she had not appeared manic or psychotic on the 
unit, her Adderall was restarted. She reported feeling much 
better, thinking more clearly, less anxious about the future, 
and more able to consider the stressors that led to her 
decompensation. She was eager to start seeing a therapist again, 
in addition to her current psychiatrist and medical NP.

Medical:
As noted above, on the day after admission, Ms. ___ became 
hypotensive to the ___ and then had a brief syncopal episode 
with slight urinary incontinence and arm jerking, no head 
trauma. Medicine was consulted, and felt orthostatic hypotension 
was the cause of the syncope, itself caused by dehydration. She 
was able to rehydrate enough to become asymptomatic with PO 
fluids alone. On the day of discharge, she was orthostatic by 
pulse but maintained normal blood pressure (105/74) on standing. 
She had no more dizziness. She ultimately revealed that although 
she had not been engaging in activing eating disorder behaviors, 
she had been eating and drinking poorly prior to coming to the 
hospital and in the emergency room due to her poor mood.
