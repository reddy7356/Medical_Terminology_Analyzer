Pertinent Results:
___ CT
Rapid progression of diffuse consolidation, most prominent in
LLL, RLL and lingula. This suggests acute infection superimposed
on a chronic process (hilar lymph nodes suggests sarcoid).
Alternatively, a continuing occupational exposure could be
considered. 

___ CXR
There is interval increase in the bilateral linear and nodular
opacities throughout both lungs. There is no pleural effusion or
pneumothorax. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged. 
1. No pneumothorax. 
2. Significant interval increase in the diffuse reticular 
nodular
opacities seen throughout both lungs. 

___ CXR
There is no pneumothorax. Linear and nodular opacities with the 
lower lobe predominance have improved in extent, compared to the
prior radiograph. No large pleural effusion is present. 
Pulmonary
vascularity is not increased.

Brief Hospital Course:
Patient is a ___ yo man with a history of asthma who presented 
with progressive hypoxia.  Ddx included idiopathic lung disease, 
pneumonia, PE.  Pulmonary embolism seemed unlikely given that 
the patient is on DVT prophylaxis and had been having these 
progressive CT changes.

HYPOXIA
He underwent diagnostic VATS on ___ which he tolerated well 
with minimal EBL. Chest tube was removed on the morning of 
___.  Intial pathology read was consistant with Hamman-Rich 
syndrome.  He was started solumedrol 250 mg q6 on ___.
On the floor he required ___ NC to keep his sats >93%. On the 
morning of MICU transfer (___) he was rolling to his side to use 
a bedside urinal and had increased hypoxia with O2sats ~85%. He 
was placed on a NRB with improvement in his sats and subjective 
feeling of dyspnea. A repeat CXR was done. He received an 
empiric dose of lasix (20 mg IV x1) with adequate urine output. 
He had transient improvement in oxygenation and was transferred 
to the MICU on NRB. 
In the MICU his oxygen saturation was supported ___ % facemask 
with waxing and waning requirement.  Pressure support 
ventilation was not required.
Combivent nebs given Q6 PRN.

POSSIBLE INFECTION
Given then patient's tenuous residual lung function and acute 
decompensation, he was also started on emperic pneumonia 
treatment with Vanc/Levo on ___.  Cultures were negative for 
AFB, PCP, ___, bacteria.  His vanc was discontinued on 
___ and restarted on ___.  He was placed on prophylactic 
Bactrim while on high dose steroids.
  
TRANSFER TO ___
When path returned as consistent with AIP, we discussed his case 
with the transplant service at our sister ___, ___ 
___, as well as with their critical care team.  We arranged 
for urgent transfer for expedited evaluation for possible 
transplantation, since we felt that this provided the best 
balance of risks and benefits.
