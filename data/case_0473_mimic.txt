History of Present Illness:
___ with DM2, ESRD on HD, CAD, CHF, who presented to ___

Discharge labs:
None

Micro:
None relevant

Path:
___ Gastrointestinal mucosal biopsies, two:
1. Gastric polyp:
- Fragments consistent with gastric hyperplastic polyp with 
focal erosion.
- Additional levels are examined.
2. "Edematous fold, duodenum":
- Duodenal mucosa with focal chronic mildly active duodenitis.
- No deeper/submucosal tissue present for evaluation. Additional 
levels are examined.

___ Liver, targeted needle core biopsy (___):
- Neuroendocrine carcinoma (grade 3) involving the liver, see 
note.
- Lymphovascular invasion is present
- Adjacent liver parenchyma with marked cholestasis, bile 
ductular proliferation and mixed
inflammatory infiltrate.
Note: The tumor cells are immunoreactive for pan-cytokeratin, 
synaptophysin, CD56 and focally
positive for villin and CDX2. Tumor cells are negative for CK7, 
CK20, PSA and TTF-1. The tumor
shows increased mitotic rate ___ HPF). These results were 
conveyed via telephone to Dr. ___ by Dr. ___ on ___.

Imaging:

From ___
--------------------
___ ERCP 
1. Dilated ducts
2. No evidenceof masses or stricture
Plan: follow LFTs, remove stent in ___ weeks, consider liver bx

___ CT A/P:
1. Persistent multiple hypoenhancing lesions in the R and L 
hepatic lobes. Findings could represent persistent multiple 
metastatic tumors or dysplastic nodules in hepatic cirrhosis.
2. Persistent unchanged marked splenomegaly with multiple 
hypoenhancing lesions. Differential diagnosis can include 
multiple metastatic tumors from unknown primary, infiltration 
with malignant lymphoma or leukemia, or multiple septic emboli.
3. Persistent unchanged s/p CCY, dilated common hepatic duct, 
but interval placement of plastic common bile duct.
4. The current examination with oral constrast shows a possible 
filling defect in upper descending duodenum posterior wall. Even 
though findings could represent redundant mucosa, duodenal tumor 
cannot be excluded. Correlation with endoscopy findings during 
ERCP is recommended.
5. No intestinal or colonic obstruction or abdominal 
inflammation or pneumoperitoneum is seen.
6. Persistent unchanged markedly atrophic kidneys with probably 
multiple renal cortical cysts.
7. No pelvic mass, lesions, abscess, or LAD is seen.

___ CT CHEST
1. Fan shaped right middle lobe atelectasis and tiny focal 
anterior medial left lingular lobe atelectasis are seen.
2. No focal lung mass lesion or mediastinal LAD is seen.
3. No thoracic aortic aneurysm or dissection is seen.

Brief Hospital Course:
___ with DM, ESRD on HD, CAD, CHF, who presented to ___ 
___ with 4 months of worsening abdominal pain, weight loss, 
and jaundice, and found to have multiple hepatic lesions on CT 
A/P concerning for malignancy. He underwent ERCP at ___ in 
___ with stent placement. Bilirubin continued to rise post 
procedurally. Repeat CT A/P was then done, which confirmed 
proper stent placement and noted continued presence of 
multifocal lesions in the liver, as well as duodenal wall 
thickening. On ___ pt underwent ___ guided liver biopsy. He was 
transferred to ___ for duodenal wall biopsy and to workup for 
a primary malignancy. Of note, GI was consulted at ___, who 
delayed inpatient colonoscopy pending the above biopsy results. 

At ___, pt underwent Endoscopy with US and biopsy of the 
duodenum showing duodenitis. Liver biopsy from ___ came 
back on ___, showing neuroendocrine carcinoma. Pt was 
presented at Tumor Board Conference on ___. Hepatology, 
Oncology, pathology, and radiology all agreed that the patient 
was a poor candidate for further intervention given his multiple 
comorbidities, the aggressive nature of the carcinoma, and the 
stage. Multiple discussion with the patient and his sons 
revealed that the patient values his independence and 
cognitition and would not want to prolong a life of 
hospitalization and illness. Palliative care was consulted, and 
the patient was transitioned to ___ focused care.

Of note, many preadmission medications were stopped. Celexa was 
continued for depression and omperazole for any pain related to 
gastritis/duodenitis. Rifaximin and lactulose were started to 
improve hepatic encephalopathy, which was within pt's goals of 
care. He received oral dilaudid for abdominal pain throughout 
the hospitalization with good effect, and on the day of 
discharge was transitioned to oxycodone elixir for ease of 
administration. He appeared comfortable on day of discharge.
