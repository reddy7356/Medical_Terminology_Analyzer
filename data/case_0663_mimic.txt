___ ECHOCARDIOGRAPHY REPORT

___       ___ MRN:   ___       TTE (Complete) 
Done ___ at 1:06:05 ___      FINAL

The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall 
thickness, cavity size, and global systolic function are normal 
(LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall 
motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Tissue Doppler 
imaging suggests a normal left ventricular filling pressure 
(PCWP<12mmHg). The number of aortic valve leaflets cannot be 
determined. There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic 
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve appears structurally 
normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. The estimated 
pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There is no 
pericardial effusion. 

IMPRESSION: Normal left ventricular cavity size and wall 
thickness with preserved global and regional left ventricular 
systolic function. No clinically significant valvular 
regurgitation or stenosis. Normal pulmonary artery systolic 
pressure. 

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of ___, 
the right ventricle was previously dilated and hypertrophied 
with borderline normal systolic function; due to technical 
limitations the right ventricle was not well visualized on the 
current study and could not be compared. 

RIGHT INGUINAL LYMPH NODE
-Biopsy consistent with T-Cell lymphoma
 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ y/o F w/ h/o CVA, aspiration, schizoaffective disorder and 
hypothyroidism p/w 7 days of lethargy and report of fever at ___ 
home placed on 7 days of Levofloxacin for reportedly positive 
U/A w/ ?slight infiltrate on CXR at ___ home transfered to ___ 
for further management in setting of lack of clinical 
improvement now has condition consistent with aggressive T-cell 
lymphoma.

# T-cell lymphoma / Fever and malaise: on arrival objective temp 
of 101.0 reported in ED at ___ w/ hx of low grade temps of 
nursing home. Infectious and thrombotic  source for fevers was 
evaluated with completely negative workup (no UTI, pneumonia, 
diarrhea, wounds). Diffuse Lymphadenopathy found on CT imaging 
which was suspicious for lymphoma and was biopsied in setting of 
high calcium and LDH. The Hematology-Oncology Team at ___ 
relayed to our primary team that the pathology is consistent 
with an aggressive T-cell lymphoma that would unlikely respond 
to chemotherapy. In discussions with the family and health care 
proxy, the decision was made for comfort measures care and for 
hospice to be involved back at the nursing home. Her persistent 
fevers have revealed no infectious source and thus are being 
attributed to her cancer. 

# CVA: basal ganglia ___, s/p G tube for nutrition. Continued 
tube feeds. Continued aspirin and plavix until comfort care in 
stopping unncessary medications. 

# Hypothyroidism: continued levothyroxine initially until

MICROBIOLOGY:
___: Urine culture: mixed bacterial flora with fecal 
contamination
___: Urine culture: no growth
.
IMAGING:
___ Chest x-ray PA/lat
FINDINGS: Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained. 
There are 
relatively low lung volumes and bibasilar atelectasis. No 
discrete focal 
consolidation is seen. There is no large pleural effusion or 
pneumothorax.  Prominence of the pulmonary arteries suggests 
possible pulmonary arterial hypertension. The cardiac silhouette 
is stable. 
.
___ Portable Abdomen, Gastrograffin study
FINDINGS: Single portable supine view of the abdomen shows the 
G-tube to be in the proper position. Contrast is seen entering 
through the tube into the body and pylorus of the stomach. There 
is a nonspecific bowel gas pattern with no evidence of ileus or 
obstruction. No intraperitoneal air is seen.  The imaged lung 
bases are unremarkable. Degenerative changes about the lower 
lumbar spine are present. 
IMPRESSION: Appropriate position of G-tube. 
 
Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ is an ___ year old lady, with a history of stroke, 
aspiration, schizoaffective disorder and hypothyroidism, 
admitted from ___ for evaluation of possible 
aspiration pneumonia, found to have a UTI.  Hospital course 
complicated by ___ and transient hypoxia.
.
.
ACTIVE ISSUES:
# UTI: UA positive with WBCs and large ___, accompanied by 
leukocytosis to 16 with left shift.  Patient was started on 
ceftriaxone for treatment of UTI, and her Foley catheter was 
changed.  Her leukocytosis subsequently resolved.  As her urine 
culture is still pending, she will continue on empiric oral 
treatment with ciprofloxacin for a course of seven days.
.
# ___: Creatinine was initially elevated to 1.5 from baseline 
1.0, and resolved to 1.1 with IVF at the time of discharge.  
FENa was consistent with prerenal azotemia, likely from poor PO 
intake in the setting of UTI.  Foley was changed and was 
functioning well.  
.  
# Hypoxia: Patient transiently desatted to 88% at nighttime, 
requiring supplemental O2.  Etiologies include undiagnosed sleep 
apnea given body habitus, atelectasis, pneumonia, pleural 
effusion and PE.  CXR was unremarkable.  This is most likely a 
combination of possibly sleep apnea with a component of 
atelectasis.  Patient was given an incentive spirometer, 
encouraged to get out of bed to chair and weaned off of 
supplemental oxygen.  She was asymptomatic.
.
.
CHRONIC ISSUES:
# Enteral nutrition: G tube site clean, with gastrograffin study 
showing G tube in place.  Continued TFs with some modification: 
Isosource 1.5 @ 75 cc/hr, cycled every 12 hours, as her home 
regimen was overfeeding.
.  
# Hypothyroidism: continued home dose levothyroxine 
.  
# Schizoaffective disorder: continued home lithium
.
# Past CVA: Continued aspirin and clopidogrel
.  
.
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
1.) At the time of discharge, urine culture was still pending.  
Final result returned with no growth.
2.) Please change TFs to Isosource 1.5 @ 75 cc/hr, cycled every 
12 hours, as her home regimen was overfeeding.
3.) Patient is confirmed DNR/DNI.

tripped and fell and wasn't able to get up. She was found in a 
prone position by an aide. Upon arrival in the ED she was 
reportedly dysarthric and neurology was consulted due to concern 
for stroke. She was also noted to have ___ upper extremity 
strength. CT head and ___ were initially negative for any 
acute process. EKG showed no ischmic changes, however trop 
returned 0.68 with a CK of 3362. She was admitted to ___ for 
NSTEMI on a heparin gtt.  
.  
On the floor she continued to have dysarthric speech. MRI of her 
brain was ordered which did show bilateral subacute ischemic 
changes in both basal ganglia and body of the caudate nucleus on 
the right with no hemorrhagic changes. CK's trended upwards, 
concerning for rhabdo and her Cr on admission was elevated, but 
has since trended downwards with IVF. Cardiology felt that her 
troponin leak was likely due to demand ischemia. Her heparin gtt 
was stopped shortly after admission. Neurology consult team has 
been following.  
.  
Ortho ___ had also been consulted due to the fall and she has 
had CT of her ___ which ___ significant canal stenosis 
which could predispose to cord trauma even after minor injury so 
a MRI of ___ was done to rule out acute cord injury which 
was limited due to motion artifact. Ortho ___ did subsequently 
clear her cervical ___ in the am of ___ and her collar was 
removed.  
.  
She was noted to have paradoxical breathing which initially 
improved after her cervical collar was removed, which 
subsequently worsened. With a respiratory rate is in the mid 
30___ and 95% oxygen saturation on a face mask, she was found to 
have a WBC 20K and repeat CXR showed right-sided opacity 
concerning for possible aspiration PNA.  She was started on 
vanc, cefepime, and flagyl prior to transfer to the medical ICU. 
 
.  
On arrival to the MICU she continued to have paradoxical 
breathing and was very lethargic. She was subsequently 
stabilized, and transferred back to the medical floor for 
continued management.

Imaging: 
TTE ___:
The left atrium is normal in size. No atrial septal defect is 
seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thickness, 
cavity size and regional/global systolic function are normal 
(LVEF 70%). The right ventricular free wall is hypertrophied. 
The right ventricular cavity is dilated with borderline normal 
free wall function. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly 
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic 
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly 
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Trivial mitral 
regurgitation is seen. There is no pericardial effusion.  
. 
CT head ___:
Bilateral basal ganglial infarcts ( acute - subacute and a few 
chronic alcunar infarcts) without evidence of hemorrhagic 
transformation or hydrocephalus or significant mass effect. Pl. 
see prior MR for additional 
details.  
.
CXR ___:
Bilateral enlargement of the hila is redemonstrated. There is 
also upper zone redistribution. These findings may represent a 
combination of pulmonary arteriovenous hypertension but no 
pulmonary edema is seen. The left lower lobe opacity appears to 
be unchanged since the prior study and might represent a 
combination of atelectasis, aspiration or infection. Upper lungs 
are clear. 
.
CT head without contrast ___: 
IMPRESSION: No evidence for acute intracranial process.
.
CXR ___:
IMPRESSION: No evidence for acute cardiopulmonary process. Left 
upper lung opacity versus bony sclerotic focus could be further 
evaluated with non-urgent chest CT. 
.
CT ___ ___:
IMPRESSION: No fracture or malalignment noted. There is 
significant canal stenosis at C5-C6 due to an eccentric disc 
osteophyte complex which predisposes to cord injury even from 
minor trauma. Given apparent neurologic deficit, consider MRI 
for further evaluation to assess for cord injury, not assessed 
by CT. 
.
MRI Cervical ___ ___:
Limited examination due to motion artifact. Multilevel 
degenerative changes with most significant change at C5-6 level. 
Apparent signal abnormality within the cord may be real or 
artifactual. Repeat examination is advised once the patient is 
able to tolerate the exam or with conscious sedation. The change 
from wet read and findings/recommendations were communicated to 
Dr. ___ by Dr. ___ at 9:30 a.m. on ___. 
.
MRI head ___:
Bilateral subacute ischemic changes involving the basal ganglia 
bilaterally with extension into the body of the caudate nucleus 
on the right with no evidence of hemorrhagic transformation. 
There is no evidence of mass effect or hydrocephalus. 
.
CXR ___:
The NG tube tip is in the stomach. The ET tube tip is most 
likely 5 cm above the carina. There is worsening of the left 
lower lobe atelectasis. The enlargement of both pulmonary 
arteries is unchanged. The upper lungs are essentially clear.
.
ECHO ___:
The left atrium is normal in size. No atrial septal defect is 
seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thickness, 
cavity size and regional/global systolic function are normal 
(LVEF 70%). The right ventricular free wall is hypertrophied. 
The right ventricular cavity is dilated with borderline normal 
free wall function. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly 
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic 
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly 
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Trivial mitral 
regurgitation is seen. There is no pericardial effusion.  
.
CT Head ___:
IMPRESSION: Bilateral basal ganglial infarcts ( acute - subacute 
and a few 
chronic alcunar infarcts) without evidence of hemorrhagic 
transformation or hydrocephalus or significant mass effect. Pl. 
see prior MR for additional details.  

 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ year-old female with schizoaffective disorder, history of 
stroke, and hypothyroidism who was admitted on ___ with an 
NSTEMI and an acute stroke s/p hypercarbic respiratory failure 
secondary to aspiration PNA, who improved but had subsequent 
difficulties swallowing and PEG tube placement.  During the 
subsequent hospital course, the patient underwent speech therapy 
and continued to improve to the point of tolerating increasing 
PO trials prior to discharge to rehab.
.
# Stroke: The patient was found to have subacute strokes in her 
basal ganglia and caudate and had weakness and dsyarthria 
present on admission, which corresponded to her neurologic 
deficits. She was initially unable to cooperative fully with a 
neuro exam, but did have hyperreflexic reflexes on exam here.  
Neurology was consulted and recommended aspirin and plavix, 
which was held briefly around the time of her PEG placement.  An 
NG tube was attempted to be placed, but patient did not tolerate 
exam.  She failed speech and swallow multiple times.  A PEG tube 
was placed for tube feeding after serial discussions with the 
patient and family. Later in her hospital course, prior to 
discharge, a video swallow study was conducted, showing that she 
had regained some swallowing function and so pureed solids were 
started in addition to tube feeds. The patient will need serial 
speech and swallow evaluations at her rehab center to monitor 
her improvement and determine when, if at all, the PEG tube can 
be removed.
.  
# Hypercarbic respiratory failure: Thought to be secondary to 
aspiration pneumonia.  She finished a full 8 day course of 
vancomycin/cefepime/flagyl.  Respiratory status was stable once 
extubated.
.
# Spinal Stenosis: Patient had trauma CT on admission remarkable 
for severe spinal stenosis with some cord compression. ___ 
surgery was consulted and felt no acute need for surgery or 
steroids however when her condition improves will likely need 
surgery.  Initially had a hard collar in place, but after 
discussion with Ortho ___, felt that collar could be removed.  
Patient will need follow-up with Dr. ___ in Ortho ___ in 2 
weeks.
.
# Trop leak/Demand ischemia: The patient was initially admitted 
to cardiology and felt to have demand ischemia in the setting of 
recent fall and stroke. She was inititally treated with a 
heparin gtt which was stopped shortly after admissison as the 
cardiologists felt it was demand ischemia in setting of 
infection. Her enzymes trended down and no ECG changes were 
noted.  TTE on ___ showed normal systolic function with no wall 
motion abnormalities.
. 
# Acute kidney injury: Elevated Cr on presentation, but trended 
down with IVF. Likely secondary to prerenal intravascular 
depleption. 
.
# Urinary Retention: The patient was found to have urinary 
retention after extubation. She failed several voiding trials 
and so a foley was placed. The patient should have serial 
voiding trials at rehab to determine when the foley can be 
removed. 
.
# Nutrition: As noted, the patient underwent PEG placement. She 
was maintained on TPN pre-procedurally, while the patient and 
family considered placement of a PEG tube and while the patient 
deferred a dobhoff feeding tube.  The day prior to discharge, 
the patient was able to start PO trials after her video swallow 
study, and the goal was to gradually increase PO intake by 
transitioning to night-time feedings at rehab.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,

It was a pleasure taking care of you during your 
hospitalization.  You were admitted after being found down at 
home.  After further work-up, it was determined that you had a 
stroke.  A CT scan of your neck also showed cervical spinal 
stenosis, or a narrowing of the spinal canal in your neck.  It 
was also thought that you were having a heart attack, however 
this ultimately was not felt to be true.  

Unfortunately, you had an aspiration event and were sent to the 
ICU where you were intubated.  You completed a course of 
antibiotics for an aspiration pneumonia and were able to be 
extubated without difficulty.  You failed several speech and 
swallow exams and needed a PEG tube placed to be able to use 
your GI tract.  This was placed by ___. You started slowly 
re-developing the ability to swallow and take some food by 
mouth. We hope that you will continue to improve your swallowing 
to the point that we be able to remove the PEG tube. 
.
You also developed urinary retention here in the hospital, and 
are being discharged with a foley. Your rehab center should 
continue to do voiding trials. We hope you will improve and we 
will be able to remove the foley.
.
We made the following changes to your medications:
STARTED Plavix
STARTED Senna
.
Please go to all of the appointments scheduled below.
