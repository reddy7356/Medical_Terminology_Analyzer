STUDIES:
=========
___ Renal U/S: Normal renal ultrasound. Normal renal Doppler.
___ Echo: The left atrium is normal in size. No atrial septal 
defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. Mild symmetric left 
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size, and global 
systolic function (biplane LVEF = 73 %). Right ventricular 
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The diameters of 
aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels are normal. The 
aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good 
leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic 
regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are structurally 
normal. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Trivial mitral 
regurgitation is seen. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure 
could not be determined. There is no pericardial effusion. 
IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with 
preserved biventricular cavity size and global/regional systolic 
function.
 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ w/ PMH of HTN and cerebral ___ transferred from ___ 
___ for hypertensive emergency, BPs 190s/100s. 

#Hypertensive emergency: Trop 0.08 was at ___, trended 
down. UA w/ mild protein and glucose may represent end organ 
damage as well given normal UA ___. Atrius records show that

started in the ED without significant effect on the patient's 
blood pressure. Captopril and labetalol were started, and the 
patient's pressures were 140s/90s monitored for 24 hours. Her 
captopril was converted to lisinopril at discharge. A workup for 
secondary hypertension was started. Renal ultrasound with 
doppler was normal. Echo showed moderate LVH but was otherwise 
unremarkable. Urine metanephrines and renin/aldosterone were 
sent off and will need to be followed up as an outpatient. She 
will follow up with her PCP.

#Fever: single fever to 101.6, afebrile thereafter. No 
leukocytosis. UCx negative. BCx no growth at discharge.

checked on ___ and ___. Likely due to nausea/vomiting. Resolved 
w/ repletion.

#Nausea/vomiting: Chronic, being worked up by outpatient GI w/ 
upper GI follow through. Gave ativan prn. Will continue w/u as 
outpatient.

as outpatient.
