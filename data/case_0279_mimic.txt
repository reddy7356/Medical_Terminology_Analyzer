injury.  The clinical suspicion for ___ disease is noted.
If ___ disease is clinically excluded the NAS Score is 4 of 
8.
The tissue will be sent for quantitative copper studies and 
results will be reported as an addendum.
 
Brief Hospital Course:
The patient is a ___ y/o gentleman with a PMH of Crohn's disease 
transferred from OSH for management of suspected cirrhosis and 
presumed hepatic hydrothorax.  
.  
# Suspected Hepatic Hydrothorax: Not treated with antibiotics, 
believed to be non-infectious and was instead due to liver 
disease. Cytology and infectious labs negative from pleural 
fluid. Chest tube had been placed on OSH, was removed on ___ by 
interventionl pulmonary team. After that, with continued 
diuresis through lasix and spironolactone and close monitoring 
of volume status, patient's respiratory status was stable and he 
was comfortably breathing on room air. On physical exam, the 
presence of the effusion was obvious, but patient's SpO2 on room 
air remained excellent and he was able to ambulate without 
discomfort. Diuresis with lasix and spironolactone will continue 
to be key to effusion control.
.  
# Liver Disease: Cirrhosis on MRCP. Believe most likely etiology 
is of fatty liver disease (patient at one point weighed > 500 
pounds) leading to inflammation and subsequent cirrhosis.
Other questionable diagnosis is ___ disease, because 
patient with low ceruloplasmin (twice, repeated test). However, 
normal 24-hour urine copper and without ___ rings 
on ophthalmology exam, and without family history, so those 
point away from the diagnosis. Liver biopsy copper studies 
pending.
Viral hepatitis studies negative for B and C. Patient does admit 
to moderate EtOH use with tylenol x ___ years, but doesn't appear 
to be adequate amount. Underlying history of Crohn's disease may 
have been suspicious for an autoimmune etiology including PSC - 
not seen on MRCP, and also without markers for autoimmune 
hepatitis. Studies not consistent with hemochromatosis. 
Interesting that synthetic function poor with INR elevated on 
admission to 3.0 and albumin 1.7; but LFT's wnl 
(AST/ALT/LDH/AP/Bili). Abdominal u/s: minimal ascites, no 
suspicious focal liver lesions, full patency of the hepatic 
vasculature. MRCP: cirrhosis.
Treated with lasix and spironolactone for diuresis given 
peripheral edema, pleural effusion, ascites.
To work-up etiology, patient had MRCP, liver biopsy, EGD (see 
results).
.  
# Plaques seen on EGD: abnormal mucosa in the esophagus seen on 
EGD, biopsy obtained, asymptomatic.
.
# ?Gastroparesis: concern based on EGD. asympomatic. plan for 
outpatient hepatology and GI f/u.
.
# Anemia: stable. not folate or B12 deficient. ferritin wnl. 
perhaps d/t crohn's or chronic disease or liver disease. not 
hemochromatosis. With portal hypertensive gastropathy on EGD, 
but without varices or evidence for GI bleed. Hct stable.
.  
# Dirty u/a with signs of blood and infection (many RBC and 
WBC), but this was right after Foley removal: asymptomatic, 
repeat u/a clean of blood or urine, and urine culture negative. 
Issue resolved.  
.  
# Crohn's Disease: Pt reports past ex-lap but no history of SB 
resection. Not on medications and no recent medical follow-up. 
Initial concern for ulcerative colitis and perhaps PSC, but no 
PSC on MRCP.
.  
# Hyperglycemia: Has not required sliding scale insulin and 
hemoglobin A1c 4.7. Hyperglycemia at OSH likely ___ medications. 
Discontinued insulin sliding scale, issue resolved.
.  
# FEN: low Na diet - teaching and emphasized to patient
.  
# Access: PICC right arm, discontinued on day of discharge

Discharge Condition:
Mental Status: Clear and coherent. 
Level of Consciousness: Alert and interactive. 
Activity Status: Ambulatory - Independent. 

 
Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,
 
You were admitted to the hospital with a diagnosis of liver 
cirrhosis and an accumulation of fluid around your lung, a 
condition called hepatic hydrothorax. You had a chest tube 
placed (and then removed) which drained the hydrothorax, but 
some fluid is still present. This will be treated with "water 
pills" (diuretics) that will help you to urinate out the excess 
fluid.
 
.
 
We performed an extensive workup of your liver cirrhosis, 
including a liver biopsy. The results from this are still 
pending. The workup was not entirely conclusive for any one 
particular cause of liver cirrhosis, but some of your labwork 
pointed towards a diagnosis called ___ disease, an abnormal 
accumulation of copper in the body. It could also be due to your 
history of obesity, which can cause liver damage and cirrhosis. 
Your new outpatient gastroenterologist can follow up on this 
workup with you, and if further results (eg, from the liver 
biopsy) do point towards ___ disease, they can initiate 
treatment as well.
 
.
 
You also had an upper endoscopy, which did not show any varices 
(dilated veins in the esophagus that can sometimes bleed). It 
did show some lesions which were biopsed, and these results are 
still pending at this time.
 
.
 
You will be taking 2 new medications, the water pills mentioned 
above:
 
START furosemide (Lasix) 20mg daily
 
START spironolactone (Aldactone) 50mg daily
 
.
 
Please take these medications every day, as prescribed. Please 
adhere to a low sodium diet, less than 2 grams per day, to 
prevent extra water retention. Please monitor your weight 
carefully, and contact your doctor if it is persistently 
increasing despite the water pills.

.
CT abd: 1. No suspicious hepatic lesions identified. Known 
underlying fatty 
infiltration of the liver with sequelae of portal hypertension 
noted including 
recanalized paraumbilical vein. Third spacing involving the 
gallbladder wall 
with mild amount of intra-abdominal ascites and mesenteric 
induration and mild 
cecal/ascending colonic edema, all likely secondary to 
underlying portal 
hypertension. 
  
2. Scattered enlarged mesenteric lymph nodes, presumably 
reactive. Mild 
dilatation and air-fluid levels of the small bowel suggestive of 
mild ileus. 
  
3. Moderate right simple pleural effusion. New infectious or 
inflammatory 
centrilobular and ___ opacities within the left lower 
lobe with mild 
bronchiectasis and bronchial wall thickening. 
  
4. Conventional arterial anatomy. Accessory right hepatic vein 
draining into 
the IVC. 
.
Echo: The left atrium is mildly dilated. The right atrial 
pressure is indeterminate. Left ventricular wall thickness, 
cavity size and regional/global systolic function are normal 
(LVEF >55%). Doppler parameters are most consistent with normal 
left ventricular diastolic function. Right ventricular chamber 
size and free wall motion are normal. The diameters of aorta at 
the sinus, ascending and arch levels are normal. The aortic 
valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet 
excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve appears 
structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is 
mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no 
pericardial effusion. 

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of ___, the 
detected pulmonary artery systolic pressure is lower.  
.
Left upper ext U/s: No DVT in left upper extremity.
.
CXR: As compared to the previous radiograph, there is unchanged 
position 
of a left PICC line and a nasogastric tube. Unchanged presence 
of a right 
pleural effusion. However, the extent of the effusion has 
decreased in the 
interval. 
.
RUQ U/S:
1. Limited study due to large amount of bowel gas obscuring 
portions of the 
left hepatic lobe and the pancreas. 
2. Where visualized, no focal liver lesion is seen. 
3. Left portal vein not visualized due to bowel gas, otherwise 
hepatic 
vasculature is patent. In particular, main and right portal 
veins are patent 
with normal hepatopetal flow. 
4. Evidence of portal hypertension, with splenomegaly and small 
ascites.  
5. Right pleural effusion. 
.
CT head: No evidence of acute intracranial process.
 
Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ is a ___ year old man with a history of ESLD ___ NASH, 
transferred here for acutely decompensated encephalopathy with 
intubation for airway protection.
.  
# Encephalopathy - likely ___ decreased bowel movements from 
ileus. CT head negative for bleed at OSH. Ileus likely caused by 
electrolyte abnormalities from 2 months of preceding diarrhea 
and pt had bowel surgeries in the past for Crohn's disease with 
small bowel/colonic anastomoses. CT scan showed bowel edema 
which may be ___ ascites and can cause malabsorption. Pt has 
been oriented and non-encephalopathic since extubation. Having 
several bowel movements on lactulose. Rifaximin was started as 
well. Will continue these as outpt.
.
# Ileus - as above, likely from electrolyte abnormalities from 
chronic diarrhea. No evidence of complete SBO at OSH, 
erythromycin was started then discontinued to help move bowels. 
Lactulose and rifaximin will be continued as outpt. Diet was 
successfully advanced and pt was able to tolerate full diet 
prior to discharge. 
.
#ESLD/Cirrhosis - cirrhosis ___ NASH diagnosed on biopsy in 
___, c/b ascites, recurrent R hydrothorax and encephalopathy. 
Unable to do diagnostic para because there was not enough fluid. 
Pt began to undergo liver transplant work-up on this admission. 
We continued Lactulose, rifaximin. Ultrasound of liver showed no 
signs of thrombosis or flow impedance. CT scan did not show 
suspicious liver lesions. Echo and PFTs were done as part of 
transplant work-up. Increased lasix dose and spirinolactone to 
manage peripheral edema. Has recurrent R side hydrothorax which 
was drained once on initial presentation in ___. Stable on CXR 
and not drained on this admission given pt's good respiratory 
status. Will follow up with Dr. ___ the remained of 
pre-transplant evaluation.
.
# Aspiration - intubated at OSH for aspiration ___ vomiting 
feculent material from ileus. CXR showed signs of aspiration 
pneumonitis, pt completed a 7-day course of vanc/zosyn. Prior to 
discharge had no oxygen requirement and was afebrile. All 
cultures were negative (of note, pt had one culture at OSH that 
grew Propionobacterium, which was likely a contaminant).
.
# Anemia - HCT around ___ throughout admission. Received 2U 
RBCs on ___. No evidence of active bleeding, no blood in stool, 
likely chronic. No evidence of hemolysis. Will follow this up as 
outpt. Encouraged pt to take home iron supplement.
