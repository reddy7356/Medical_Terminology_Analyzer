History of Present Illness:
___ yo w/ hx of hepatitis C (neg VL), psoriatic arthritis, DM, 
HTN, depression, hx of etoh abuse ___ sober) and CKD stage III 
(per notes), who presented to the ED with c/o of b/l flank pain. 
 

Pt. reports that over the past few months he has felt more 
fatiuge that usual.  He has lost 12lbs during that time but 
states that it was intentional.  Over the past week, he 
developed bilateral flank pain, dull, gradual, w/o radiation.  
He was seen at ___ on ___ where he was admitted, was treated 
for pain and discharged home (per pt.).  He apparently had CT 
abdomen that may have shown a liver mass.  Since leaving ___, he 
continued to feel malaised, developed SOB on exertion and while 
laying flat, had had decreased PO intake and feeling of being 
generally weak.  He noted loose stools over the past 4 days.  He 
reports that his roommate noted that his abdomen is larger, 
however, he has not noted this himself.  After being at home in 
above state,  
.
In the ED, initial vs were: T97.1F P83 BP115/86 R28 96%O2 sat.  
He underwent an abdominal US, which showed an echogenic liver 
without discrete mass on US and MPV, LPV and RPV thrombosis with 
small amount of ascites. With NG lavage, was noted to have a 
small amount of red blood in NS fluid after removal of ~1L of 
meds and food.  Rectal exam was notable for BRBPR/hemorrhoids.  
Heparin gtt was held given concern for GIB and Protonix gtt was 
started.  He received 15g of kyaxylate PO for hyperkalemia, 
which was suctioned w/ NG lavage.  Paracentesis revealed 900 
WBCs w/ 51% PMNs and ~ 14.5K RBCs.  He was given Zosyn IV for 
suspected SBP.  His tachypnea persisted, as did o2 requirement, 
thus was transferred to MICU.  
. 
On the floor, VS were 95.5F, 116/63, 87, 18, 94% on NRB. He was 
diaphoretic and taking rapid, shallow breaths.  He felt mildly 
SOB, but had no other complaints.

Brief Hospital Course:
___ year old with a history of hepatitis C (neg viral load), 
psoriatic arthritis, Diabetes Mellitus, hypertension, 
depression, history of etoh abuse ___ years sober) and chronic 
kidney disease stage III, who presented to the ED with 
complaints of bilateral flank pain.  He was found to have portal 
vein thrombosis, bloody nasogastric lavage, bright red blood per 
rectum, tachypnea and repiratory distress. 
.
# Portal Vein Thrombosis (main, left, right):  Given the 
patient's history of a lung mass on CT at an outside hospital, 
malignancy was initially of great concern although 
hypercoaguable diseases, pancreatitis, and cirrhosis were also 
considered.  
The patient was started on a heparin drip on HD 2 after an 
endoscopy confirmed no active bleeding.    A hypercoaguability 
panel was deferred to a later date as the patient was already 
started on heparin. A hepatitis panel and PSA were negative or 
within normal limits.  An HCV viral load was pending at the time 
of death.  A CEA was elevated concerning for malignancy. 
.
# Acute Renal Failure / Chronic Kidney. The patient's acute 
renal failure was likely oliguric ATN with a FeNa of 1.7,  The 
etiology may have been due to pre-renal ATN from intravascular 
depletion and underperfusion of the kidney.  The patient was 
initially given an albumin load and started on a lasix drip.  
The lasix drip was switched to lasix boluses becuase the 
patient's BUN was increasing.  Initially the patient's 
creatinine stabilized but did not decrease as would have been 
expected in ATN.  The patient was in metabolic acidosis, with 
elevated K+.  The patient was given kayexalate, bicarbonate and 
lasix with some improvement in his potassium.  Extensive 
discussions with the patient revealed that he did not wish for 
invasive interventions, hemodialysis, to improve metabolic 
status.  Afternoon labs on HD3 revealed elevated potassium and 
worsening creatinine.  The patient was given an 80mg bolus of 
lasix with low urine output. The patient persistently refused 
kayexalate. An EKG demonstrated no change, no evidence of high 
k+.  
.
# Metablic Acidosis, Respiratory acidosis: The patient presented 
with uncompensated mild lactic acidosis with concommitant 
respiratory acidosis. The patient's metabolic acidosis initially 
improved with albumin and lasix.  On HD 3, afternoon labs 
revealed worsening renal function.  The patient did not respond 
with adequate urine output to an 80 mg lasix bolus.  The patient 
developed agitation in the afternoon which was thought to be 
secondary to receiving ativan and morphine for a CT scan as the 
onset coincided.  The patient was given his celexa in the 
evening and was noted to calm down.  He was called by nursing 
becuase of episodes of diaphoresis and agitation upon awakening 
that disappeared upon sleeping.  An EKG revealed no evidence of 
acute MI or elevated k+. The patient was evaluated, vital signs 
were normal, (RR, HR and BP within normal limits) and stable and 
the patient was afebrile and continued to refuse medical care.  
In the evening it was decided to draw blood cultures, change his 
foley, send a urine culture and check his electrolytes.  At this 
time, the patient developed deep breathing and worsening 
diaphoresis.  Repeat labs and an ABG revealed marked lactic 
acidosis with a pH of 7.1. The patient developed hypotension to 
systolic ___ and became transiently unresponsive.  5L of normal 
saline were administered with levophed for pressure support.  
Bicarbonate and Narcan were also given and antibiotic therapy 
was extended to vancomycin and cefepime.  Pressures returned and 
the patient was initially stabiliized and levophed was weaned 
off.  Kayexalate per rectum was administered to the patient, 
stimulating another bradycardic hypotensive event.  The patient 
was supported maximally with levophed and phenylephrine drips.  
Bicarbonate was again administered. A central line was placed in 
the right femoral artery for central access. The patient 
developed bradycardia and ventricular fibrillation before 
passing.  Per the patient's wishes he was not intubated.
.
# Malignancy: A CT from ___ showed potential 15mm 
lesion in R lobe of liver; 10mm lesion in L lobe of liver. The 
patient presented with a normal AFP (1.4) but high levels of CEA 
(228), concerning for colon CA, cholangio CA, pancreatic CA, 
gastric CA, lung CA, medullary thyroid.  However, CEA can also 
be raised in cirrhosis or pancreatitis.  A CT chest abdomen and 
pelvis was performed without contrast (the patient has renal 
failure) on HD 3 to evaluate interval change of prior masses and 
evaluation of possible new masses.  Preliminary read of the CT 
showed masses in the liver, lungs and mediastinum.  Palliative 
care and the patient's ___ Diabetes doctor were consulted to 
discuss the patient's stated wish to not pursue invasive 
treatment measures.  The patient expressed wishes to not have 
dialysis, chemotherapy or non-curative surgery.
.
# Hypoxemia.  The patient’s hypoxemia is likely multifactorial: 
likely a combination of volume overload, pulmonary vascular 
shunting from liver thrombi, restrictive due to increased 
intraabdominal pressure w/ ascites, restrictive due to obesity, 
underlying pulmonary disease from chronic smoking. As hypoxia 
worsened over the patient's first night, there was concern for a 
PE, given patient's hypercoagulable condition.  The patient was 
being treated for portal venous thrombosis with heparin drip, 
which is the treatment for PE.  A TTE revealed no evidence of 
transpulmonary shunting or PFO or ASD.  There was mild left 
vetricular hypertrophy, a bicuspid valve and moderate pulmonary 
hypertension noted.
.
# Spontaneous Bowel Perforation: A diagnostic paracentesis was 
postive for SBP although the patient demonstrated no clinical 
signs of encephalopathy or fever.  The patient was started on 
ceftriaxone and an albumin challenge for HD 1 and 3. 
.
#. Diabetes: PO diabetic drugs were held.  Blood sugars were 
covered Humulin 15U HS
and insulin sliding scale.
.
# Anxiety / pain: The patient's anxiety and pain were treated 
with IV morphine and ativan.  The patients gabapentin and buspar 
were started when the patient was cleared for diet
.
# HTN.  The patient's antihypertensive medications were held as 
he was normotensive on admission.
.
# Bloody NG lavage at end of procedure. Etiology unclear, at 
first there was concern for varcieal bleeding. The patient was 
initially treated with IV ppi and octreotide.  Endoscopy 
revealed no variceal bleeding and octreotide was discontined and 
ppi was changed to PO.
.
# Bright Red Blood per Rectum:   Likely due to external 
hemorrhoids. Hcts were monitored.

Pertinent Results:
CT CHEST:
CTA CHEST: There is no pulmonary embolism. There is no acute 
aortic 
pathology. However, 1 cm above the sinotubular ridge, the 
ascending thoracic aorta measures 4.2 cm. At the level of the 
main pulmonary artery, the descending aorta measures 3.1 cm, and 
at the level of the diaphragmatic hiatus, the aorta measures 2.5 
cm. There is no dissection. There is marked coronary artery 
vascular calcification and calcification of the aortic valve. 
There is no pericardial effusion. There are 9-mm cardiophrenic 
nodes. 
  
There is a small-to-moderate size right pleural effusion 
measuring simple 
density ___ Hounsfield units). There is adjacent compressive 
atelectasis. There is a 2.5 x 1.9-cm nodule at the right base 
containing coarse calcifications and soft tissue density most 
consistent with a hamartoma. There is atelectasis at the left 
base. 13 x 12 mm pulmonary nodule at the right apex (3:10). 
There is no axillary, hilar, or mediastinal lymphadenopathy. 
  
This study is not tailored for subdiaphragmatic evaluation. 
Given these 
limitations, the partially visualized upper abdominal organs 
appear grossly unremarkable apart from calcifications of the 
splenic artery. 
  
BONE WINDOWS: There are no suspicious sclerotic or lytic 
lesions. There are acute right-sided sixth, seventh and eighth 
rib fractures. There is an acute left ninth rib fracture. There 
are multiple chronic bilateral rib fractures. 
  
IMPRESSION: 
1. No pulmonary embolism. 
2. Acute right-sided sixth, seventh and eighth rib fractures and 
left ninth rib fractures with multiple chronic bilateral rib 
fractures. 
3. 13-mm nodule at the right apex. The patient will require 
three-month 
interval chest CT to assess for change. Benign-appearing 
hamartoma at the 
right base also noted. 
4. Mild dilation of the thoracic aorta as described. 
5. Coronary artery vascular calcifications.  
6. Right pleural effusion with compressive atelectasis. 

ECHO:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is moderate symmetric 
left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is 
moderately dilated. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal 
wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Overall left 
ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). There is no 
left ventricular outflow obstruction at rest or with Valsalva. 
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. 
The aortic root is moderately dilated at the sinus level. The 
ascending aorta is moderately dilated. The number of aortic 
valve leaflets cannot be determined, but appear to be bicuspid. 
The aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened. There is 
mild aortic valve stenosis (valve area 1.5 cm2). Mild to 
moderate (___) aortic regurgitation is seen. The aortic 
regurgitation jet is eccentric. The mitral valve leaflets are 
mildly thickened. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. The 
estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There is 
no pericardial effusion. 

IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Moderate concentric 
hypertrophy with preserved biventricular global systolic 
function. Dilated left ventricular cavity. Possible bicuspid 
aortic valve with mild aortic stenosis and mild to moderate 
eccentric aortic regurgitation. Moderately dilated aorta. No 
structural cause of syncope identified.

Patient also on 5 antihypertenzive medications including 
Labetalol.  Given syncope likely related to cough and vasovagal 
discontinued beta blocker to allow for compensatory heart rate 
response. Additionally, logn discussion was had with patient 
abotu smoking cessation as inciting event is coughing which 
patient states is caused by his smoking.  Patient to discuss 
with PCP.

Echo showed concerntric LVH with normal EF and no cause for 
syncope.  Abdominal ultrasound was done and read is still 
pending at time of discharge.  Wet read from radiology showed no 
ascites. Patient also found to have small-moderate effusion on 
CT, surgery was consulted and determined drainage was not 
necessary.  Patient to have repeat CXR in 1 week when he follows 
up with his PCP to ensure decrease in effusion.  Rib fractures 
also seen on CT. Patient discharged with several days of pain 
medications. ___ with 2 sets.  EKG and tele with out

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted with recurrent fainting when you cough.  It is 
likely that your blood pressure drops when you cough and causes 
you to faint.  You were also on a medication that lowers heart 
rate which may contribute to fainting.  This medication was 
stopped.  

You had an ultrasound of your heart that showed evidence of long 
standing high blood pressure, but nothing that would cause 
fainting. 

You had an abominal ultrasound that showed no fluid in your 
abdomen, though the final read of this is still pending.  If it 
abnormal, you will be contacted.

You had several rib fractures that were seen on CT scan and on 
your chest x-ray.  Additionally, you had some fluid around your 
right lung that is likely related to your rib fractures.  You 
need to have a follow up chest x-ray next week to ensure that 
this fluid collection is resolving.  Your primary care doctor is 
aware of the need for this chest x-ray.

The following medication changes were made:
- STOPPED:  Labetalol, please stop taking this medication.
- ADDED:  Percocet 1 tab every 4 hours as needed for pain.  DO 
NOT take any additional Tylenol with this.  Additionally, do not 
drink alcohol or drive while on this medication as it can cause 
drowsiness.

No other medication changes were made.  You should continue all 
your other home medications as directed.

Your smoking is likely worsening your cough.  You were provided 
smoking cessation counseling.  You should speak with your 
primary care doctor to discuss this further.

If you have dizziness, lightheadedness, fainting, shortness of 
breath, chest pain, high fever, severe abdominal pain or any 
other concerning symptom, please seek medical care immediately.

It was a pleasure meeting you and participating in your care.
