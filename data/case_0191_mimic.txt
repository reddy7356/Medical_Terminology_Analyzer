IMAGING
=========================================
CT A/P ___:  
 1.  There is extravasation of enteric contrast into the right 
side of the large abdominal fluid and gas collection indicative 
of a bowel perforation. Although not well defined, the leak 
appears most likely from adjacent small bowel and less likely 
from adjacent ascending colon or cecum.  A pigtail catheter is 
coiled ___ the dependent portion of this fluid collection. 
 2.  Large pelvic mass concerning for ovarian or uterine 
malignancy with peritoneal carcinomatosis, distant 
lymphadenopathy, hepatic lesions, and osseous sclerotic foci 
compatible with diffuse metastases. 
 3.  Cholelithiasis, diverticulosis, and bilateral simple renal 
cysts. 
   
CT A/P ___:
1. Right-sided pigtail within a large rim enhancing loculated 
intra-abdominal fluid-gas collection, known to be draining 
purulent fluid. 
2. Enlarged, heterogeneous pelvic mass, likely uterine or 
adnexal, with central low-density areas possibly representing 
necrosis, with loculated intra-abdominal ascites and diffuse 
peritoneal carcinomatosis.  Possible tumor erosion and 
perforation through the right uterine fundal wall. 
3. Enlarged mesenteric, retroperitoneal, and pelvic lymph nodes, 
extensive omental caking, hepatic masses, and diffuse osseous 
sclerotic foci compatible with widespread metastases. 
4. The constellation of findings are suggestive of a gynecologic 
malignancy.  A recent omental biopsy is pending. 

___: Final pathology  
Morphology and immunoprofile are compatible with a gynecological 
primary site (ovary, fallopian tube, or endometrium), favor high 
grade serous carcinoma.

 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ w/out significant PMHx admitted w/ severe abdominal pain and 
found to have stage IV high-grade serous ovarian cancer 
(metastatic to the liver, bone, and peritoneum) c/b bowel 
microperforation (s/p drain placement) and B. fragiles 
bacteremia (on vanc/flagyl/aztreonam), who was initiated on 
carboplatin (without paclitaxel) on ___, which she tolerated 
well.

#High grade serous mullerian tumor
Pt has newly diagnosed stage IV serous ovarian cancer with mets 
to the liver, bone and peritoneum.  Tumor markers included: 
CA-125 at OSH (over 700), ___ (147;
nl ___. There were extensive discussion with her primary 
oncologists, gynecology/oncology, and colorectal surgery 
regarding management, and whether to pursue upfront surgery, 
which poses risks of further perforation and damage to an 
already friable bowel versus upfront chemotherapy.  Per the 
surgery services, it seems the bowel perforation is not likely 
amenable to surgical repair without significant risk and 
morbidity.  Therefore, chemotherapy was pursued.  For high grade 
serous mullerian tumor, treatment traditionally consists of 
double agent carboplatin and paclitaxel.  However, this carries 
the risk of neutropenia, and her bowel perforation puts her at 
increased risk for systemic infection.  Therefore, after 
extensive discussion with the patient and her primary 
oncologist, the patient proceeded with single agent carboplatin 
(___), which she has tolerated without adverse effect.  
Carboplatin was dose reduced by 33%. Also started on neupogen on 
___ to prevent neutropenia ___ setting of intraabdominal 
infection. Planning to continue neupogen to complete a 10-day 
course (last day ___. She has outpatient GYN Onc follow up w/ 
Dr. ___ Oncology followup w/ Dr. ___. Plan is to 
continue chemotherapy for now, w/ possible upcoming debulking 
and bowel repair operation. Pt is to continue antibiotics until 
that operation.

#Bowel microperforation/tumor enteric fistula/Secondary 
peritonitis
On admission, patient underwent ___ guided paracentesis draininag 
1L of purulent/feculent material, concerning for a tumor enteric 
fistula versus bowel perforation. Following drainage of 
approximately 1 liter of purulent/feculent ascites, a drain was 
left ___ place.  She underwent two upsizing procedures ___ and 
___ to address both reduction ___ drainage and leakage around 
the drainage site, respectively. Follow-up CT imaging ___ and 
___ with both oral and rectal contrast demonstrated concern 
for a bowel perforation, likely ___ the small bowel. A 
significant amount of intraperitoneal fluid was also noted on 
imaging. Colorectal surgery was consulted ___ light of the bowel 
perforation to assess the need and safety for surgery to perform 
either a diversion or resection and ostomy. Given the patient's 
stable status and ___ light of her metastatic disease, surgery 
was not recommend. To manage her bowel perforation, she was made 
NPO with PPN on ___ and TPN initiated on ___ and she was 
placed on an antibiotic course (see below). During admission, 
she remained afebrile, with minimal abdominal pain, but with 
continued abdominal drainage of fluid (~300-600cc/day).

#Secondary peritonitis & B.fragilis bacteremia: 
Paracentesis culture showed many organisms all sensitive to 
levofloxacin, and patient found to have B. fragilis bacteremia 
as well. For infections, pt was initially on 
vanc/flagyl/aztreonam IV then switched to PO flagyl/levofloxacin 
___ (which she will continue indefinitely).

#Nutrition: 
PPN was started on ___ w/ transition to TPN ___ after ___ 
placed. Cycled down to 18 hours by discharge. She was not cycled 
to 12 hours because of episodes of hypoglycemia during the day. 
She was advanced to juice, which she tolerated well and improved 
her BGS. 

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES
1. Pt scheduled for f/u w/ Dr. ___ Gynecology ___ 
and w/ Dr. ___ Oncology
2. Pt to continue TPN at night. She should be continued at 18 
hours for now, since she experienced episodes of hypoglycemia 
during the day with cycling down her TPN. Pt needs close 
monitoring of her BGS every 4 hours.
3. Pt to continue having juice as tolerating. Could consider 
re-imaging ___ 3 weeks and consider advancing diet at that time.
4. Pt needs close monitoring of the drain output. Once the drain 
output is less than 10cc/day for 3 days ___ a row, she may have 
the drain removed by Interventional Radiology. 
5. Pt needs to have drain flushed forward with 5 cc towards the 
body and 5 cc towards the bag with sterile saline TID. 
6. If catheter stops draining suddenly: Check that the stopcock 
is open. Remove dressing carefully and inspect to make sure that 
there is no kink ___ the catheter. Inspect to be sure that there 
is no debris blocking the catheter. If there is, then firmly 
flush 5 cc of sterile saline into the catheter.
7. Consider allergy consult for penicillin desensitization as 
outpatient
8. Patient will have weekly lab draws on ___ for TPN 
management at ___ (please see TPN order for fax number)

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,

You were admitted to the Oncology service at ___ 
___ given your new diagnosis of ovarian 
cancer and your recent severe abdominal pain. You underwent 
multiple procedures while admitted to the hospital, including a 
paracentesis and a biopsy of the omentum. You were found to have 
an infection ___ your abdomen likely from a small hole ___ your 
bowels. You had a procedure done to place a drain ___ this 
infection to allow the fluid to drain. You were also started on 
broad spectrum IV antibiotics and transitioned to oral 
antibiotics. After discussion with oncology, gyn oncology and 
colorectal surgery, it was decided to start treatment with 
chemotherapy. You were also started on a medication called 
neupogen/filgrastim to prevent your blood counts from going too 
low with the chemotherapy and allow your immune system to 
continue fighting your infection. Due to the hole ___ your 
bowels, you were unable to eat solid food. You were started on 
nutrition ___ your IV and you will continue this at home. 

You will follow up with GYN oncology as well as medical oncology 
after discharge to determine the best next steps (see below 
"recommended follow-up" section for further details).

Sincerely,

Your ___ team
