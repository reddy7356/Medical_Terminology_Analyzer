No mass/thrombus is seen in the left atrium or left atrial 
appendage. The interatrial septum is aneurysmal. A patent 
foramen ovale is present. A left-to-right shunt across the 
interatrial septum is seen at rest. There is mild symmetric left 
ventricular hypertrophy. Overall left ventricular systolic 
function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size 
and free wall motion are normal. There is intimal thickening and 
focal calcifications in the descending thoracic aorta. No 
thoracic aortic dissection is seen. The aortic valve leaflets 
(3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and 
no aortic stenosis. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The 
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is focal 
posterior mitral annular calcification. Mild (1+) mitral 
regurgitation is seen.
POST-CPB: There is mild symmetric LVH with normal global 
systolic function, estimated EF = 55%. There is mild AI, mild 
MR, mild TR, unchanged from pre-op. There is now evidence by 
color Doppler of bi-directional flow through the PFO. There is 
no evidence of dissection.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,

 It was a pleasure taking care of you during your 
hospitalization.  You were treated for atypical right sided 
chest pain.  The cardiac surgeons saw you in the emergency room 
and did not think this was a problem with your CABG.  We checked 
an EKG and enzymes and they showed no damage to your heart.  We 
thought this pain was musculoskeletal.  We treated this with 
pain medication.  You also had a gout flare that was treated 
with colchicine.  

We made the following changes to your medications:
Added
Gabapentin 200mg by mouth three times daily

Brief Hospital Course:
HOSPITAL COURSE
___ old female w HTN, HLD, DM, CAD w 3VD scheduled for 
CABGx3, chronic pain syndromes, who presented w bilateral hand 
cramping, was ruled out for ACS with neg EKG and CE x3, was not 
found to have any concerning underlying etiologies and was 
discharged with instructions to return on ___ for her 
CABG
.
ACTIVE
# Cramping: In a patient w cardiac risk factors and known 3VD, 
ACS was considered in the setting of her 1d hand/arm cramping.  
However, given the atypical nature of her symptoms (bilateral 
arms, L leg, no chest pain), as well as her unchanged EKG and CE 
negx1, it was thought to be an unlikely cause.  Metabolic 
process was considered, but the lack of electrolyte 
abnormalities, glucose abnormalities, and symptoms w exertion, 
made this less likely.  No midline pain, recent trauma, or 
dermatomal pattern of symptoms made radiculopathy less likely.  
CK was nl so myositis was less likely.  The patient was ruled 
out for ACS with CE negx3.  She was continued on Zocor, 
Amlodipine, Aspirin, Imdur, BB.
