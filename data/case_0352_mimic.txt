Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ is a ___ y/o female known to the neurosurgery service 
with a known large right arachnoid cyst. She was recently 
admitted with a new onset seizure and discharged on Keppra. She 
returns to the ED on ___ with one day of left upper extremity 
numbness, clumsiness or weakness. She underwent a head CT which 
showed the right parietal cyst, stable in size. There was no 
intracranial hemorrhage noted on imaging. The neurology team was 
consulted and do not believe her symptoms are the result of 
seizure activity. They recommended continuing the Keppra at her 
current dose. 

On ___, the patient continued to have left upper extremity 
weakness on examination. It was determined she would undergo 
placement of a cystoperitoneal shunt in the operating room the 
following day. She underwent a pre-operative work-up in 
anticipation for the surgery. She was made NPO after midnight. 
The risks and benefits of the surgery were discussed and the 
patient consented to the procedure. 

On ___, the patient was taken to the OR with Dr. ___ 
placement of a right cystoperitoneal shunt.  Her operative 
course was uncomplicated; she was extubated and transferred to 
PACU in stable condition.  Post-op CT showed expected post-op 
changes with a moderate amount of pneumocephalus, decrease in 
size of the cyst,  decrease in the amount of midline shift and 
right lateral ventricle effacement. Her neurologic exam 
post-operatively was stable. The patient was transferred to the 
step-down unit for close neurological monitoring.

On ___, the patient is clinically improved and her head CT 
shows decrease in the size of the cyst and no new findings.  She 
has been ambulating independently and will be discharged home.  
She will follow up with Dr ___ in ___ weeks with a repeat 
Head CT.

•You may shower at this time but keep your incision dry.
•It is best to keep your incision open to air but it is ok to 
cover it when outside. 
•Call your surgeon if there are any signs of infection like 
redness, fever, or drainage. 

Activity
•We recommend that you avoid heavy lifting, running, climbing,

Medications
•***Please do NOT take any blood thinning medication (Aspirin, 
Ibuprofen, Plavix, Coumadin) until cleared by the neurosurgeon. 
•***You have been discharged on Keppra (Levetiracetam). This 
medication helps to prevent seizures. Please continue this 
medication as indicated on your discharge instruction. It is 
important that you take this medication consistently and on 
time.
