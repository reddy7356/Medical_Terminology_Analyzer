Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ is a ___ who presents as a transfer from an OSH 
(___) with a non-contrast CT scan showing a splenic 
hematoma. She reports she was in her usual state of health until 
day of admission when she felt acute onset left sided abdominal 
pain. She denies falling or any traumatic injury. 

Upon transfer to ___, patient noted to have an episode of 
hypotension in the range
of 97/58 along with tachycardia with a HR of 114. Received 2 
units of RBCs for hematocrit of 22.5. 

On day after transfer the patient was taken to the ___ suite Pre 
embolization arteriogram of the celiac artery demonstrates areas 
of active extravasation within the spleen as well as compression 
of the normal, enhancing splenic tissue by a large subcapsular 
hematoma as demonstrated on prior CT abdomen and pelvis from ___. 
Post embolization arteriogram demonstrates complete occlusion of 
the splenic 
artery after deployment of a 12 mm Amplatzer plug within the 
proximal splenic 
artery. 

On the day following the embolization, the hematocrit was again 
noted to have fallen to 20.6. She received an additional 2 units 
of RBCs with post hematocrit of 28% and then this remained 
stable.

Additionally during this time the patient had acute kidney 
injury, with creatinine rise to 2.1. Creatinine on admission to 
___ was reported to be 2.0. A renal consult was 
obtained. An ultrasound of the native kidneys showed the right 
kidney measuring 8.9 cm. The left kidney measures 9.2 cm. There 
is no hydronephrosis, stones, or masses bilaterally.  Normal 
cortical echogenicity 
and corticomedullary differentiation are seen bilaterally. Urine 
output was around 700 cc daily. 
Of note, the patient appeared volume overloaded, with c/o 
shortness of breath, edema of both hands and feet and an oxygen 
requirement with bilateral crackles on exam. She received IV 
Lasix due to these symptoms.

Abdominal pain had improved following the embolization, but with 
the events surrounding the required coiling, and anticipated 
surgery for the as yet undiagnosed gall bladder mass, Dr. 
___ was planning for surgery on ___. An echo was 
obtained prior to her surgery, LVEF  was 65%. 

On ___ the patient was taken to the OR with Dr. ___ 
___, as in the days following the embolization, she continued 
to have abdominal pain and fevers.  CT scan demonstrated a 
splenic abscess and therefore the decision was made to proceed 
with splenectomy, and since her upcoming surgical plan included 
gallbladder excision and possible liver resection if Pathology 
had concerns for a gallbladder carcinoma, this was the surgical 
plan. 
At the time of surgery, it was noted upon entering the abdomen 
that there was hemoperitoneum. Approximately one liter of old 
clot was ultimately removed during the procedure. Once the lap 
chole was performed, the location of the proposed mass
seen on imaging was identified as a submucosal area that was 
mostly cystic and filled with bile.  No true mass was identified 
and there was no concern for malignancy. Therefore , Dr ___ 
___ not to proceed with a liver resection. The splenectomy was 
then able to be performed still laparascopically. After the 
completion of all these interventions she was transferred to the 
PACU in stable condition. There was a delayed extubation for 
apnea, and she received one liter of IV fluid immediately post 
op for low urine output. On POD 1, IV Lasix was tried with 
increased urine output. ___ Unasyn was discontinued.

On POD 2, Meningococcal & pneumoccoccal vaccines were given. 
dressings were taken down and the incisions were clean, dry and 
intact. She was able to void when the Foley catheter was 
removed.

On POD 3 she received the HiB & PPSV23 vaccinations and 
carvedilol was started for blood pressures in the 160's and 
slight tachycardia. 

Creatinine was 2.0 on admission, with creatinine elevation noted 
prior to this admission , more precisely on ___ when her 
Cr was at 1.5 mg/dl from a baseline of 0.7. The creatinine 
started to rise, and she was placed on a Low K diet, and a renal 
consult was called. The acute kidney injury was most likely ATN 
secondary to bleeding and then with the initial post op 
hypotension. Daily creatinine was trended 
with discharge creatinine of 2.8. Urine output has been around 
900 cc daily. Outpatient follow up with a nephrologist is highly 
recommended.

On POD 7 the patient received one additional unit of RBCs for 
Hct of 28%, hoping to help with kidney perfusion. Hematocrit has 
varied from ___ since transfusion

The patient has been slow to increase diet following surgery 
once she was cleared to eat. Followed by nutrition, she has been 
encouraged to take in at least three supplement drinks daily, 
with attention to increasing oral intake and ___ 
has provided a summary sheet which will be included.

Seen by ___, the patient was deemed a suitable candidate for a 
skilled nursing facility to regain strength and mobility as well 
as attention to her nutrition issues, getting daily weights.

JP drain was removed prior to discharge. The drainage had always 
been serosanguinous without any bile. Incisions are clean dry 
and intact.
