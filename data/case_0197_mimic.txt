IMAGING/STUDIES:
================
Chest X-Ray PA and Lateral ___
FINDINGS: 
Atrio biventricular defibrillator leads are in standard position 
and unchanged in appearance.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette 
and hilar contours are normal.  The pleural surfaces are clear 
without effusion or pneumothorax.   
  
IMPRESSION:   
No evidence of pneumonia or acute cardiopulmonary process. 

Cardiac Catheterization ___
Findings
ESTIMATED blood loss: <30 cc
Hemodynamics (see above): Low normal systemic arterial BP. Upper
normal left-sided filling pressure.  
Coronary angiography:  right dominant
LMCA:  Patent
LAD:  Mild diffuse luminal irregularities. The mid vessel at the
diag origin is markedly tortuous and ___. 20% ulcerated
(versus calcified) plaque in the proximal LAD at the takeoff of
the D1. The D1 is a small branch. The D2 is a large tortuous
bifurcating branch. Several views obtained to lay out the LAD-D2
bifurcation. There is 40-50% tapering just beyond the origin of
the diag and 50% at the LAD. TIMI 3 flow noted throughout.
LCX:  Large system gives two large bifurcating OM branches.
___ proximal to the OM1 origin. TIMI 3 flow. 
RCA:  20% ostial. The rest of the vessel has mild luminal
irregularities without significant lesions. Somewhat sluggish
flow suggestive of microvascular dysfunction. 

Assessment & Recommendations
1.Moderate CAD and probably microvascular dysfunction.
2.Ulcerated plaque in the proximal LAD. Cold be a nidus for 
spasm. 
___ Rx including dual antiplatelets, statins and 
spasmolytics.
4.Consider outpatient stress test if symptoms recur to assess 
significance of the mid LAD and D2 moderate lesions. 
5.Discussed with Dr. ___ 

 
___ Hospital Course:
___ year old female with hx. nonischemic CM s/p BivICD (___), 
CAD s/p RCA stent (___) presented to ___ today with c/o 
chest pain, was found to have positive ultrasensitive troponin 
to 0.06 concerning for ACS, transferred for cardiac 
catheterization at ___.
 
ACUTE ISSUES:
============= 
# Unstable angina: Pt presented with a history and findings 
concerning for unstable angina in a patient with several risk 
factors. Pt was found to have a positive ultrasensitive troponin 
at OSH, but troponins were found to be negative x 2 with no 
evidence of ischemia on EKG at ___. Given the pt's reported 
history and the fact that her pain mimicked her past cardiac 
ischemic pain, she was taken to the cath lab and found to have 
stable moderate CAD, probable microvascular dysfunction, and an 
ulcerated plaque in the proximal LAD deemed to be a possible 
nidus for
vasospasm.  No interventions were performed.  It was believed 
that vasospasm around the ulcerated plaque or resolved 
thrombosis at the ulcerated plaque may have caused pt's 
symptoms.  Post procedure, patient was started on Plavix 75mg 
daily and Imdur 30mg daily for vasospasm.  In addition, she was 
continued on her home ASA and metoprolol.  Pt was started on 
atorvastatin high dose due to concern for ACS, which was changed 
to home rosuvastatin prior to discharge.  Pt's losartan was 
transiently held in the setting of slightly increased Cr, but 
was restarted at discharge with Cr at baseline.  Pt will have 
follow up with PCP/Cardiologist, Dr. ___, within 1 
week of discharge.       
 
# Leukocytosis: Pt was found to have a leukocytosis to 19.5 on 
presentation.  UA demonstrated large leuk esterase and many 
WBCs, however pt denied symptoms and no other signs of infection 
were found.  It is possible that pt's leukocytosis was 
attributable to reactive leukocytosis in the setting of pt's 
transient cardiac ischemia.  However, pt was treated briefly 
with Ceftriaxone, which was discontinued prior to discharge.  
Pt's leukocytosis was trending to baseline at discharge.

# Azotemia:  Pt presented with Cr 1.3 from baseline 1.1.  Pt's 
losartan was held on admission, and restarted prior to discharge 
with pt's Cr back at baseline. 
 
CHRONIC ISSUES:
=============== 
# CAD: As discussed, pt was continued on her home ASA, 
metoprolol, and statin.  Pt's losartan was held briefly and 
restarted prior to discharge.  Plavix 75 mg daily and Imdur 30mg 
daily were added at discharge.   
  
# CHF: Pt was continued on home metoprolol and digoxin.  Pt's 
losartan and lasix were held briefly, and restarted prior to 
discharge.
  
# Afib: Pt was continued on home sotalol, metoprolol, and ASA.  
  
# T2DM: Pt's home metformin was held, with BG controlled with 
SSI while hospitalized.  

# GERD: Pt was continued on home ranitidine 
 
# Hypothyroidism: Pt was continued on home levothyroxine   

# HLD: Pt was changed to atorvastatin 80 mg due to concern for 
ACS, however was changed back to home rosuvastatin on discharge. 
 

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
====================
- Pt was discharged on Plavix 75 mg PO daily
- Pt was discharged on Imdur 30 mg PO daily, which can be 
titrated up 
- Pt will need to follow up with PCP/Cardiologist Dr. ___ 
___ within 1 week of discharge
- Consider outpatient stress test if symptoms recur to assess
significance of the mid LAD and D2 moderate lesions.

Discharge Instructions:
Mrs. ___,

___ was a pleasure taking care of you during your stay at ___.  
You presented with chest pain consistent with unstable angina, 
and you were treated medically and then taken to the cardiac 
catheterization lab.  Catheterization demonstrated no changes in 
your coronary arteries, and no interventions were performed.  
The only notable finding was an ulcerated plaque in a proximal 
vessel that may have caused your vessels to spasm.  You will be 
discharged home on your previous medications, in addition to two 
new drugs:
Imdur 30 mg PO daily to prevent vasospasm
Plavix 75 mg PO daily for coronary artery disease. 

Please call your PCP/Cardiologist Dr. ___ to schedule a follow 
up appointment within 1 week of discharge.

Weigh yourself every morning, call MD if weight goes up more 
than 3 lbs.
 
Followup Instructions:
___
