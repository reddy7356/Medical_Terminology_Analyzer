The history is provided by the patient's wife as the patient is 
unable to answer any questions.  Approximately 1 week ago the 
patient had a temperature to 101 along with associated myalgias 
that resolved with a night of sleep.  He proceeded to feel 
normal throughout the week.  Yesterday, one day prior to 
admission, his wife returned home from work at 4 ___ and found 
the patient covered in blankets saying he was called with 
Rigors.  He had significant nasal congestion and cough.  The 
patient went to bed at that time and proceeded to have several 
coughing fits that were severe during which she would gasp for 
air.  He was able to tell her he felt fine during that time but 
otherwise did not speak much.  At 2 AM she awoke to find her 
husband sweating through the bed, with rigors, and ongoing 
fever.  He was obtunded and unable to answer any questions or 
follow any commands.  She noted that he had had fecal 
incontinence.  She called an ambulance and was taken to ___ 
___.

infection, pulmonary embolism, or other abnormalities.  He had a 
right upper quadrant ultrasound which showed no evidence of 
cholecystitis or biliary ductal dilatation.  He also had a chest 
x-ray and an abdominal x-ray which were unremarkable for any 
acute finding.  He was initially given vancomycin and Zosyn and 
this was later broadened to ceftriaxone, ampicillin, and 
acyclovir at meningitis dosing. He was also given 10mg 
dexamethasone and PR Tylenol.  He is transferred to ___

RELEVANT STUDIES:
=================
___ CXR PORTABLE AP:
Linear retrocardiac opacities, which most likely represent 
atelectasis 
although early aspiration pneumonitis cannot be excluded. 

___ CXR PORTABLE AP:
Worsening likely pulmonary edema compared to ___.

___ MR HEAD W/ & W/O CONTRAST: 
1. Small focus of diffusion signal abnormality in the left 
occipital lobe is consistent with a subacute infarct. 
2. 5 mm outpouching from the anterior communicating artery, 
possibly 
representing an aneurysm or vascular loop, for which CTA is 
recommended for further characterization.  No evidence of 
subarachnoid hemorrhage. 
3. No abnormal enhancement or other definite evidence of 
meningitis. 
4. Paranasal sinus disease and nonspecific mastoid opacification 
as described. 

___ TTE:
The left atrium is normal in size. There is no evidence for a 
right-to-left shunt with agitated saline at rest. The right 
atrial pressure could not be estimated. There is mild symmetric 
left ventricular hypertrophy with a normal cavity size. There is 
moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with 
hypokinesis of the anterior wall and anterior septum (see 
schematic) and preserved/normal contractility of the remaining
segments. No thrombus or mass is seen in the left ventricle. 
Quantitative biplane left ventricular ejection fraction is 35 %. 
Left ventricular cardiac index is low normal (2.0-2.5 L/min/m2). 
There is no resting left
ventricular outflow tract gradient. Tissue Doppler suggests a 
normal left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP less than 
12mmHg). Normal right ventricular cavity size with normal free 
wall motion. The aortic sinus diameter is normal for gender with 
normal ascending aorta diameter for gender. The aortic arch 
diameter is normal with a normal descending aorta diameter. The 
aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal. There is 
no aortic valve stenosis. There is no aortic regurgitation. The 
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened with no mitral valve 
prolapse. There is trivial mitral regurgitation. The tricuspid 
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is physiologic 
tricuspid regurgitation. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic 
pressure is borderline elevated. There is no pericardial 
effusion.

IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Mild symmetric left 
ventricular hypertrophy with moderate regional systolic 
dysfunction most c/w coronary artery disease (LAD distribution). 
No right-to-left shunt at rest.

likely ___ viral encephalitis. His hospital course was c/b 
hypoxic respiratory failure requiring intubation, CHF 
exacerbation, and new afib/aflutter. He was actively diuresed 
and weaned to room air.

ACUTE ISSUES:
=============
#Acute encephalopathy, resolved
#Viral encephalitis
___ viremia
Patient p/w several days of high-grade fevers and AMS to OSH, 
where he underwent LP with CSF studies showing lymphocytic 
pleocytosis with elevated protein and normal glucose, suggestive 
of a viral process. On transfer, repeat CSF studies at ___ 
were consistent with the above. His exam was also notable for a 
rash thought to be viral exanthema. He was initiated on empiric 
vancomycin, CTX, ampicillin, acyclovir, and doxycycline (for 
possible tick-borne illness); these antibiotics/anti-virals were 
discontinued with negative infectious work-up and due to c/f 
doxycycline-induced transaminitis as below. He underwent 
extensive work-up for causes of meningitis and encephalitis, 
which was unrevealing other than a positive serum ___ B 
antibody titer, though of note, CSF enteroviral RNA was 
negative. ___ CSF Ab and Borrelia mi___ CSF PCR were 
still pending at the time of discharge. ___ MRI showed no e/o 
abnormal enhancement c/f meningitis. He was followed by 
Infectious Disease and Neurology throughout his course. By the 
time of discharge, he had clinically improved without focal 
neurological deficits. He was discharged home with home ___.

#Hypoxic respiratory failure
#Acute-on-chronic systolic heart failure
Patient required intubation for airway protection in the setting 
of altered mental status. He was extubated on ___ and initially 
had O2 requirement of 3L NC. Acute-on-chronic systolic heart 
failure likely developed in the setting of aggressive IVF 
resuscitation while in the MICU. TTE on admission showed LVEF 
35% with RWMA in an LAD distribution with no e/o valvular 
disease. He was actively diuresed with IV Lasix for pulmonary 
edema seen on CXR and weaned to RA. In the setting of known 
HFrEF, he was started on lisinopril, and his home metoprolol was 
uptitrated. He was discharged on lisinopril 30mg daily and 
metoprolol succinate 100mg daily.

#Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation/aflutter
Patient developed afib with RVR to the 150's on ___ c/b 
hypotension with SBP's in the ___. He has no known history of 
afib. Arrhythmia likely occurred in the setting of acute illness 
and volume overload superimposed on known ischemic heart 
disease. CHADS2-VaSC 5. He was bridged from heparin to 
rivaroxaban 20mg daily and continued on metoprolol as above.

#Alcohol use disorder
Patient endorses daily alcohol use with 4 beers and 3 mixed 
drinks but denies history of withdrawal. S/p phenobarbital 
taper. He also received thiamine and folate repletion. Patient 
declined Social Work consult.

#Transaminitis
AST/ALT noted to be uptrending since ___ with a hepatocellular 
pattern shortly after initiating empiric doxycycline, c/f 
drug-induced liver injury. Transaminitis did not improve despite 
diuresis, less c/w congestive hepatopathy. Doxycycline was 
discontinued prior to discharge. Please follow up patient's 
LFT's within a week of discharge.

#Subacute occipital lobe ischemic infarct
Seen on ___ MRI with unclear etiology. He was started on 
systemic anticoagulation for c/f embolic event.

#Anterior communicating artery aneurysm
Noted incidentally on ___ CTA head/neck. Please consider 
connecting patient with a neurologist for interval imaging and 
follow-up of anterior communicating aneurysm.

CHRONIC ISSUES:
===============
#CAD c/b ischemic cardiomyopathy
H/o stents placed in ___ and ___, for which he had been on 
DAPT. Due to need for systemic anticoagulation in the setting of 
pAF and e/o prior ischemic infarct, he was initiated on 
rivaroxaban and continued on clopidogrel 75mg daily. ASA was 
stopped. He continued atorvastatin 80mg qHS and metoprolol and 
lisinopril as above.

#COPD
- continued on home mometasone-formoterol inhaler

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
====================
- For PCP: ___ will follow up on the pending encephalitis studies

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,

It was a pleasure taking care of you at the ___ 
___.

Why did you come to the hospital?
- You were admitted because of high fevers and a change in your 
mental state.

What did you receive in the hospital?
- You had many tests to determine if an infection was causing 
your symptoms. We believe that a virus may have caused 
encephalitis, or inflammation of the brain, for which the 
treatment is supportive (and time to allow you to recover).
- While you were in the hospital, you were also treated for an 
irregular heart rhythm, called atrial fibrillation, that 
developed because of being sick. You were started on a blood 
thinner called Xarelto/rivaroxaban to decrease the risk of 
stroke related to blood clots forming in the heart from this 
irregular rhythm.
- Because of receiving a lot of fluids while you were sick, you 
also had extra fluid in your lungs. We gave you a water pill 
through the IV, a medication that helps get rid of the excess 
fluid.
- You were also given a medication called phenobarbital because 
of concern that you might withdraw from alcohol.

What should you do once you leave the hospital?
- Please continue to take all of your medications as prescribed.
- You have follow-up with your primary care doctor and 
cardiologist.
- Please weigh yourself every day and call your doctor if your 
weight increases by more than 3 pounds in one day.

We wish you all the best!
- Your ___ Care Team
