RUQ U/S - IMPRESSION:

secondary to volume overload. No convincing evidence of 
cholelithiasis or acute cholecystitis.

splenomegaly.

CXR - IMPRESSION: 
Bibasilar retrocardiac opacities, which could be due to 
atelectasis, aspiration, and/or infectious pneumonia. Repeat 
radiograph with improved inspiratory level would allow more 
complete assessment of this region.

CT A/P - 
IMPRESSION:
1. Findings suggestive of multifocal hepatoma associated with 
the portal vein invasion
2. Small to moderate ascites
 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ with HCV Genotype ___ s/p failed therapy IFN, Sovaldi 
complicated by PVT and cavernous transformation, rising AFP and 
recent diagnosis of likely ___ admitted with cholangitis s/p ___ 
guided cholangiogram which was clear, clinically stable with 
improving LFTs WBC and fever curve during admission also s/p EUS 
to eval for pancreatic involvement.
       
# Sepsis: 
# Cholangitis: 
Patient was febriled with leukocytosis and biliary obstruction 
on labs.  RUQ US and CT scan demonstrated areas of proximal 
intrahepatic biliary dilatation due to several liver masses 
concerning for HCC.  CXR also suggested PNA though he had no 
symptoms for this.  He was diagnosed with cholangitis due to his 
liver masses causing obstruction.  He was started on 
Levo->Cipro/Flagyl and Liver, ERCP, and ___ were consulted.  His 
fever and leukocytosis resolved with IVF, and his LFTs improved. 
 He went for PTBD on ___ though ___ ultimately did not find 
full bile obstuction and no PTBD were performed. He clinically 
improved while on Cipro and Flagyl and was never hemodynamically 
unstable.  Treated with 7 days of antibiotics.
   
# Likely Hepatocellular carcinoma: With 5cm mass near head of 
pancreas. Liver confirmed dx of HCC, and recommended EUS and 
biopsy of enlarged lymph node, as that would have treatment 
implications in the future. EUS performed with biopsies pending 
at the time of discharge.
   
# HCV cirrhosis:
Chronic, Genotype ___ s/p failed therapy IFN, Sovaldi complicated 
by PVT, splenic vein thrombosis and cavernous transformation. 
Mild coagulopathy and small amount of non tappable ascites.  
Liver followed during his stay and he was continued on 
Rifaximin.  He remained compensated during admission
  
# GERD:

Imaging detected a tumor in your liver causing bile obstruction. 
 Hepatology, radiology, and GI were involved in your care and 
you underwent a cholangiogram and an endoscopic ultrasound with 
biopsy of your lymph node. You will follow up as below to review 
the results of this biopsy. 

You were also treated with antiobiotics for a possible infection

time that demonstrated no tumor. In early ___ was hospitalized 
for abdominal pain, and had had a triphasic CT scan of the 
abdomen and pelvis that demonstrated enhancement of at least two 
large cystic masses in the caudate lobe and segment IV measuring 
3.1 x 3.8 cm. He was treated at this time for cholangiitis.

associated splenomegaly, paraesophageal, gastric, and rectal 
varices. Of note, there was not evidence of bowel obstruction. 

On arrival to the floor, the patient endorsed mild to moderate

IMPRESSION:

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,

It was a pleasure caring for you during your hospitalization at

admitted with abdominal pain. We did tests which showed fluid in 
your abdomen and your known liver cancer and clot in the blood 
vessel of your liver. We did a test of the fluid in your abdomen 
which did not show any infection. Your were started on a 
medication called nadolol to prevent/reduce your risk of 
bleeding in the setting of your liver disease called cirrhosis. 
During this hospitalziation, you were unable to fully empty your 
bladder on your own and we placed a tube which you continued to 
require. You will need to keep the urinary tube until you 
followup with the Urologists. You also were found to have a 
urinary tract infection and you were treated with antibiotics. 
If you develop any fevers, chills, pain, nausea, vomiting, 
cloudy or malodorous urine, please alert your doctor
