History of Present Illness:
HISTORY OF PRESENTING ILLNESS: 
___ is a ___ year old man with relapsed mantle cell
lymphoma who is admitted from the ED after syncopizing during
rituximab infusion in clinic.

Patient was diagnosed with relapsed MCL during admission in
___ in the setting of 'convulsive syncope', which patient 
has
had on and off for at least a year. That admission was notable
for extensive workup including telemetry monitoring, PPM
interrogation, EEG, and CTH - all negative except new lacunar
infarct on CT. MRI brain was notable for right occipital FLAIR
hyperintense enhancement; LP showed elevated protein but 
negative
for lymphoma. He was later admitted to the ICU from ___ to
___ for septic shock and pneumonia; he completed treatment
with cefpodoxime and azithromycin. 

He presented to clinic today to initate treatment for his
relapsed MCL with rituximab. Per nursing clinic note:

"[Patient] given premeds as ordered, Rituxan started at ___
infusion rate, was up to 100mg/hr and pt's face slightly 
flushed.
VSS. No other sx. Pt then called to say he was nauseated approx.
20mins into the 100mg/hr rate. When entered pts room pt was 
ashen
and staring straight ahead and eyes rolled upward. Started
vomiting and unresponsive for a few seconds.  Suction obtained
and pt put on his side. Immediately became responsive again. No
further seizure activity Rituxan was stopped immediately.  Seen
by Dr. ___ NP. Pt [was] sent to ED." 

Patient denies any bowel or bladder incontinence and there was 
no
tongue biting. His wife notes he had some bilateral arm shaking.
He awoke without post-ictal state and currently feels well.

Since his prior admission he has been generally weak and 
fatigued
but without acute complaint. No fevers or chills. No headaches 
or
diplopia. No dysphagia. No recent URTI symptoms although he has 
a
chronic cough. No CP or SOB. No N/V/D. Normal BM today. He 
denies
orthostatic sytmpoms. No new leg pain or swelling. He has
intermittent positional neuropathy in his left leg. He reports 
he
passes out once every few months. His wife reports his last
episode was in ___. 

In the ED, initial VS were pain 0, T 95.9, HR 80, BP 110/78, RR
18, O2 97%RA. Labs notable for Na 141, K 5.1, HCO3 20, Cr 1.2,
WBC 6.2, HCT 37.1, PLT 78. LFT's and urate from earilier in day
were normal. CXR showed no acute process. EKG showed sinus 
rhythm
with PAC's. EP was consulted, who felt cardgiogenic cause was
unlikely. He was admitted to ___ for further management.

Brief Hospital Course:
===============================
PATIENT SUMMARY STATEMENT
===============================
___ man with past medical history of mantle cell 
lymphoma complicated by ocular and CNS involvement (s/p auto 
transplant, maintenance ritux ending ___, now with 
recurrence and was started
on rituximab, a history of recurrent syncope, SSS status post
pacemaker, pAFib (Eliquis) who presents with vasovagal syncope 
which occurred during rituximab infusion.

===============================
ACTIVE ISSUES:
===============================

#Syncope
Patient was 20 minutes into his rituximab infusion when he was 
noted to have a red face. He then developed nausea and this was 
the last thing he remembered. Per nursing, he had moments of 
staring, vomited and then synopsized. He presented to the ED 
where his vitals signs were stable. Of note, patient has already 
received a extensive workup at last hospitalization a few months 
ago. This included an MRI that
showed possible recurrence of CNS lymphoma but with one negative
LP and per discharge summary this was not felt to be consistent
with CNS recurrence. He also had a continuous EEG for 3 days
during the hospitalization that did not show any epileptiform
discharges or seizure activity. Overall this current spell seems 
consistent with the one he was admitted for in ___ and 
likely represents a vasovagal syncope. 

During this admission, his neurologic exam was nonfocal but 
notable for hyperreflexia throughout including clonus in 
bilateral ankles. Brisk reflexes felt likely due to chronic 
cervical spinal disease which was confirmed on MRI spine. 
Patient also had full cardiac work-up including interrogation of 
pacemaker which was normal. TTE without cause for syncope and 
troponins were negative. LP was deferred given no signs of 
infection and low concern for CNS disease. Ultimately, his 
symptoms were felt to be a result of vasovagal syncope with some 
components of orthostatics. Patient was counseled on isometric 
counterpressure maneuvers and will be discharged with 
compression stockings. Patient will require tilt-table test as 
outpatient.

#Recurrent Mantle Cell Lymphoma
Patient was found to have disease relapse in ___ with 
plan to initiate R2 with ritux infusion aborted on ___ due to 
syncope. Rituximab was redosed on ___ uneventfully. Patient to 
hold revlimid till outpatient appointment with Dr. ___. He 
received prophylaxis with acyclovir

#Thrombocytopenia
Not far off of recent baseline; likely related to relapsed
lymphoma. Platelets on discharge were 90k.

===============================
CHRONIC ISSUES
===============================

#Sick sinus syndrome s/p pacemaker
#AFib
Continued home apixiban. EP evaluated pacemaker and felt to be 
functioning appropriately.

#BPH
Continued home tamsulosin.

#HTN
Has been off losartan since recent admission so continued to 
hold this medication.

#Prior CVA
No longer on ASA; Apixiban as above and continued home statin

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,  

It was a pleasure caring for you at ___. 

WHY WAS I IN THE HOSPITAL?  
-You came to the hospital because you passed out while receiving 
your rituximab infusion.

WHAT HAPPENED TO ME IN THE HOSPITAL?  
-While you were here, you had a lot of tests to evaluate why you 
were passing out. Labs were normal, your pacemaker is working 
well and the MRI of your brain and spine did not show any 
cancer. It did show degenerative spinal disease which can happen 
as people age.

- We know you have had these passing out spells before and we 
think this is due to your body overreacting to some triggers 
which lowers your blood pressure causing you to faint. We did 
not find any neurological causes for you passing out.
 
WHAT SHOULD I DO AFTER I LEAVE THE HOSPITAL?  
-If you feel like you are about to pass out, please try crossing 
your legs or tensing your lower body muscle. Lying down and 
raising legs may also be beneficial if it can be done safely. We 
will also discharge you with some compression stockings that 
help push blood to the heart to prevent these episodes.

-Please stop taking your Revlimid until you follow-up with Dr. 
___. 

-Please call your neurologist to schedule a follow-up 
appointment within the next 2 months.

-Please continue to take all your medicines and keep your 
appointments.  

We wish you the best!  
Sincerely,  
Your ___ Team

DIAGNOSIS: 
FLOW CYTOMETRY REPORT 
FLOW CYTOMETRY IMMUNOPHENOTYPING 
The following tests (antibodies) were performed: Kappa, Lambda, 
FMC-7 and CD antigens 5, 10, 11c, 19, 20, 23, and 45.
RESULTS:
10-color analysis with CD45 vs. side-scatter gating is used to 
evaluate for leukemia/lymphoma.
Only 0.67% of total acquired events are evaluable non-debris 
events.
The viability of the analyzed non-debris events, done by 7-AAD 
is 100.00%.
A focused panel is performed to evaluate B-cells. 
CD45-bright, low side-scatter gated lymphocytes comprise 26.93% 
of total analyzed events.
B cells are scant in number precluding evaluation of 
clonality/further characterization. 
INTERPRETATION
Non-diagnostic study. Cell marker analysis was attempted, but 
was non-diagnostic in this case due to insufficient numbers of 
cells/insufficient amount of tissue for analysis. Correlation 
with clinical and other ancillary findings is recommended. Flow 
cytometry immunophenotyping may not detect all abnormal 
populations due to topography, sampling or artifacts of sample 
preparation.

FLOW CYTOMETRY REPORT 
FLOW CYTOMETRY IMMUNOPHENOTYPING
The following tests (antibodies) were performed: Kappa, Lambda, 
FMC-7 and CD antigens 5, 10, 11c, 19, 20, 23, and 45.
RESULTS:
10-color analysis with CD45 vs. side-scatter gating is used to 
evaluate for leukemia/lymphoma. 
Approximately 38.53% of total acquired events are evaluable 
non-debris events. 
The viability of the analyzed non-debris events, done by 7-AAD 
is 98.72%.
CD45-bright, low side-scatter gated lymphocytes comprise 13.10% 
of total analyzed events.
A subset (approximately 50%) of B cells demonstrate lambda light 
chain restriction. This population co-expresses pan-B cell 
markers CD19 and CD20 along with CD5 and is negative for CD10, 
CD11c and CD23. The remainder of the B cells detected are 
polyclonal.
A population of hematogones is seen.
INTERPRETATION
Immunophenotypic findings consistent with involvement by mantle 
cell lymphoma. Correlation with clinical, morphologic (see 
separate pathology report ___ and other ancillary 
findings is recommended. Flow cytometry immunophenotyping may 
not detect all abnormal populations due to topography, sampling 
or artifacts of sample preparation.

SPECIMEN: BONE MARROW ASPIRATE AND CORE BIOPSY.
DIAGNOSIS:
NORMOCELLULAR BONE MARROW WITH MATURING TRILINEAGE HEMATOPOIESES 
AND
INVOLVEMENT BY THE PATIENT'S KNOWN MANTLE CELL LYMPHOMA, SEE 
NOTE.
Note: By immunohistochemistry, there are scattered T cells 
immunoreactive for CD3. CD20 highlights multiple paratrabecular 
aggregates of B-cells, which additionally stain with CD5.
By flow cytometry (___), there is a lambda restricted, CD5 
positive B-cell lymphoma consistent with mantle cell lymphoma. A 
BCL1 stain is in progress. MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION
Peripheral blood smear: The smears are adequate for evaluation. 
Erythrocytes are slightly decreased in number,
normochromic, normocytic and have no anisopoikilocytosis. The 
white blood cell count is normal. The platelet count is 
decreased. Occasional large and giant platelets are seen. A 100 
cell
differential shows 55% neutrophils, 35% lymphocytes, 5% 
monocytes, 4% eosinophils, and 1% basophils.
Bone marrow aspirate: The aspirate material is adequate for 
evaluation and consists of multiple cellular spicules. The M:E
ratio estimate is 1.4:1 Erythroid precursors are normal in 
number and exhibit predominantly normal
maturation, rare erythroids with irregular nuclear contours are 
seen . Myeloid precursors are normal in number and show 
predominantly normal maturation. Megakaryocytes are normal in 
number;
abnormal forms are seen, including forms that are hypolobated or 
contain disjointed nuclei. A 300 cell differential shows 3% 
blasts, 13% promyelocytes, 15% myelocytes, 8% metamyelocytes, 
17%
bands/neutrophils, 0% eosinophils, 41% erythroids, 3% 
lymphocytes, and 0% plasma cells. ___

Clot section and biopsy slides:
The core biopsy material is adequate for evaluation. It consists 
of a 1.3 cm long core biopsy composed of cortical bone and 
trabecular marrow with a cellularity of 40-50%. There are 
clusters of
lymphocytes in a para-trabecular organization. Erythroid 
precursors are normal in number and have overall normoblastic 
maturation. Myeloid precursors are normal in number and exhibit 
normal
maturation. Megakaryocytes are mildly increased in number; 
hypolobated forms are seen.

CYTOGENETICS REPORT - Final
SPECIMEN: BONE MARROW
CLINICAL HISTORY: History of mantle cell lymphoma
CYTOGENETICS PROCEDURE: Unstimulated and 3 day 
DSP30/IL2-stimulated cultures for Giemsa-banded chromosome 
analysis.
FINDINGS: An apparently normal 46,XY male chromosome complement 
was observed in 20 mitotic cells examined in detail. Chromosome 
band resolution was 400-450. A karyogram was prepared on
3 cells. CYTOGENETIC DIAGNOSIS: 46,XY[20] Normal male karyotype.
INTERPRETATION/COMMENT: Every metaphase bone marrow cell 
examined appeared to be karyotypically normal. However, FISH 
detected the IGH/CCND1 gene rearrangement in 1% of the 
mononuclear interphase cells examined (see below). These 
findings are consistent with persistence
or recurrence of the patient's known mantle cell lymphoma.
This normal karyotype makes a chromosome abnormality unlikely. 
There is a possibility that low grade mosaicism, a subtle or 
cytogenetically cryptic
chromosome rearrangement, a non-mitotic neoplastic clone, and/or 
copy number neutral loss of heterozygosity would be present and 
go undetected with routine chromosome analysis.
FISH: LOW POSITIVE for IGH/CCND1. 1% of the mononuclear 
interphase bone marrow cells examined had an abnormal probe 
signal pattern consistent with the IGH/CCND1 gene rearrangement 
characteristic of mantle cell lymphoma.
Uncultured cells for fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) 
analysis with the ___ Molecular IGH/CCND1 XT dual color dual 
fusion translocation probe set: SpectrumOrange directly labeled 
probe for the CCND1 gene region on ___ and SpectrumGreen 
directly labeled probe for the IGH locus on 14q32. This probe 
combination detects the IGH/CCND1
gene rearrangement brought about by the t(11;14)(q13;q32) 
translocation characteristic of mantle cell lymphoma and seen in 
some plasma cell neoplasms. FINDINGS: A total of 200 interphase 
nuclei were examined with the CCND1 and IGH dual color dual 
fusion probe set
and fluorescence microscopy. 199 cells (99%) had 2 red signals 
and 2 green signals. 2 cells (1%) had ___ yellow ___ 
___-___ Department of Pathology 
Patient: ___ 2 of 2
(red-green fusion) signals, 1 red signal and 1 green signal. 
Normal cut-off values for this probe set include: 86% for a
normal 2 red and 2 green probe signal pattern and 1.5% for a ___ 
yellow (red-green fusion), 1 red and 1 green signal
pattern. ___ ish(CCND1,___)x3(___ con ___
This test was developed and its performance characteristics 
determined by ___ Laboratory. 
It has not been cleared or
approved by the ___ Food ___ Drug Administration (FDA). The FDA 
does not require this test to go through premarket FDA review. 
This test is used for
clinical purposes. It should not be regarded as investigational 
or for research. This laboratory is certified under the Clinical 
Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) as qualified to perform 
high complexity clinical laboratory testing.
2) FISH: NEGATIVE for DELETION of TP53. No evidence of 
interphase bone marrow cells with deletion of the TP53 gene.
Uncultured cells for fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) 
analysis with the ___ Molecular TP53 and CEP17 dual
color probe set: SpectrumOrange directly labeled probe for the 
TP53 gene on 17p13 and SpectrumGreen directly labeled probe for 
the centromeric region of chromosome 17. This probe combination 
detects deletions of the TP53 tumor suppressor gene.
FINDINGS: A total of 200 interphase nuclei were examined with 
the TP53 and CEP17 dual color probe set and fluorescence 
microscopy. 193 cells (91.5%) had 2 red and 2 green signals. 4 
cells (2%) had 1 red signal and 2 green
signals. 3 cells (1.5%) had 1 red signal and 1 green signal. 
Normal cut-off values for this probe set include: 86% for the
normal 2 red and 2 green signal pattern, 8% for a 1 red and 2 
green pattern, and 4% for a 1 red and 1 green pattern.
___ ish(TP53,CEP17)x2[200]

SPECIMEN: LYMPH NODE, RIGHT INGUINAL NODE, CORE NEEDLE BIOPSY.
DIAGNOSIS:
RELAPSED MANTLE CELL LYMPHOMA, SEE NOTE:
Note: Sections of lymph node core biopsies show an effaced 
architecture with a diffuse pattern of abnormal lymphocytes. The 
lymphocytes are primarily medium in size with scant cytoplasm, 
mildly
irregular nuclear contours, coarse and dense chromatin, and 
inconspicuous nucleoli. Occasional mitotic figures are present.
By immunohistochemistry, CD20 highlights the B-cells comprising 
the vast majority of the lymphoid population, while CD3 
highlights scattered T-cells. CD5 and BCL1 are co-expressed in 
the B-cell
population. CD21 and CD23 highlight residual follicular 
dendritic meshworks. BCL2 is diffusely positive. BCL6 and CD10 
are negative. By Ki-67 immunostaining, the proliferation index 
is low with
an overall fraction of 10% which focally increases to 20%.
Overall, the findings are those of a mantle cell lymphoma, 
consistent with the patient's known disease. Correlation with 
clinical, radiographic, cytogenetics (___-___) and flow 
cytometry (see
report ___ findings is recommended.

FLOW CYTOMETRY IMMUNOPHENOTYPING
The following tests (antibodies) were performed: Kappa, Lambda, 
FMC-7 and CD antigens 5, 10, 11c, 19, 20, 23 and 45.
RESULTS: 10-color analysis with CD45 vs. side-scatter gating is 
used to evaluate for leukemia/lymphoma. The viability of the 
analyzed non-debris events, done by 7-AAD is 31.9%. A focused 
panel is performed to evaluate B-cells. CD45-bright, low 
side-scatter gated lymphocytes comprise 97.5% of total analyzed 
events. B cells comprise 95% of lymphoid-gated events and 
demonstrate monoclonal lambda light chain restriction. They 
co-express pan-B cell markers CD19 and CD20 along with CD5. They 
do not express any other characteristic antigens including 
FMC-7, CD10, CD11c and CD23. INTERPRETATION: Immunophenotypic 
findings consistent with involvement by mantle cell lymphoma. 
Correlation with clinical, morphologic (see separate pathology 
report ___ and other ancillary findings is recommended. 
Flow cytometry immunophenotyping may not detect all abnormal 
populations due to topography, sampling or artifacts of sample 
preparation.

MR ___ w/ w/out contrast ___:
1. Medial right occipital lobe FLAIR hyperintense leptomeningeal 
enhancement, similar in appearance to examinations of ___ (which had subsequently resolved on follow-up examinations) 
raises concern for recurrent lymphoma thus leptomeningeal 
disease.  This could be further evaluated or confirmed with 
lumbar puncture as clinically indicated. 
2. Unchanged 6 mm focus of tissue isointense to brain 
parenchyma, without 
enhancement, stable since ___, arising from the lateral margin 
of the right middle cerebellar peduncle.  This could represent 
normal brain parenchyma, post treatment change; suggestive of a 
benign entity given stability and lack of enhancement.  This may 
represent a hamartoma. 
3. Interval progression of global parenchymal volume loss and 
now moderate 
changes of chronic white matter microangiopathy since ___. 
4. Solitary nonspecific focus of chronic microhemorrhage, right 
basal ganglia.

Brief Hospital Course:
==================
SUMMARY STATEMENT:
================== 
___ PMH of Mantle cell lymphoma with CNS involvement
(s/p auto transplant, maintenance rituximab ending ___, 
HTN,
CVA/CRVO, SSS (s/p PPM), pAFib (Eliquis), Convulsive Syncope, 
who
presented from ___ s/p episode of convulsive
syncope, in light of pathologic rib fracture and diffuse
lymphadenopathy seen on imaging s/p LP and BMBx found to have a 
recurrence of mantle cell lymphoma.

==============
ACTIVE ISSUES:
==============
#Convulsive Syncope
Patient has hx of convulsive syncope, of unclear etiology. On 
this current admission, he suffered an episode of convulsive 
syncope following acute pain in right back (possibly due to 
acute rib fracture) which may have precipitated vasovagal spell 
as back to usual self after vomiting, but was seated during 
episode. The patient's wife described the incident as him losing 
consciousness and having twitching of his hands/legs for about 1 
minute. No arrhythmia on Tele, EKG or PPM interrogation and 
troponin negative. No neurologic exam findings to suggest 
stroke. Seizure possible given urinary incontinence, but patient 
and wife deny post ictal state or tongue biting and EEG without 
epileptic activity. CTH without new bleed or mass, although 
there is a new lacunar infarct not seen on prior CTH. Had 
orthostatic vital signs ___ AM although asymptomatic and given 
fluid bolus, but this does not seem to be the culprit of his 
syncopal episode. He had an MRI that showed a medial right 
occipital lobe FLAIR hyperintense leptomeningeal enhancement, 
similar in appearance to examinations of ___ (which had 
subsequently resolved on follow-up examinations). This likely 
does not represent new CNS lymphoma.

#Mantle Cell Lymphoma Recurrence
#Diffuse Lymphadenopathy seen on CT Chest
Diffuse lymphadenopathy on exam and CT highly suspicious for
malignancy given concurrent pathologic rib fracture and diffuse
lymphadepathy. Upon presentation denied B symptoms and no 
signs/symptoms of infection. CTH without CNS involvement and MRI 
with right occipital FLAIR hyperintense enhancement, but per 
neuro oncology likely does not represent new CNS lymphoma. BM 
and LN biopsy with mantle cell lymphoma and LP with elevated 
protein but without malignant cells. Will set patient up with 
follow up for PET scan and treatment for his mantle cell 
lymphoma in ___ days from discharge. He will continue on his 
acyclovir ppx.

#Acute Pathologic Rib Fracture
Patient described acute right back pain which precipitated above
event and may have represented acute fracture, although short
duration of pain and the fact that it is completely resolved as
well as described location is not consistent with a new rib
fracture. Fortunately, he is now asymptomatic and did not 
require analgesia while in house.

===============
CHRONIC ISSUES:
===============
#Afib: On apixaban at home. Was on heparin gtt for procedures 
and
now back on home apixaban.

#Hx of B12 deficiency
Has on and off again use of B12. B12 wnl on admission.

#SSS s/p PPM
#hx of CVA/CRVO
#hx of pAFIB
#HLD
#HTN
No arrhythmia on EKG on PPM interrogation and troponin negative
so tele discontinued. His statin was discontinued initially, but 
re-started on discharge. He was also continued on his home 
losartan. 

#Lacunar infarct seen on CT: Appears new from last scan, no new 
sx. MRI without evidence of new infarct. 

====================
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
====================
[] Patient should have PET scan prior to therapy
[] Will follow up with outpatient oncology to re-establish care 
and start treatment
[] Of note, patient and family would like care close to home

there was a questionable opacity seen on the portable radiograph 
but no evidence is currently seen with abnormality most likely 
reflecting summation of vascular shadows.  If patient's symptoms 
persist, assessment with a chest CT to exclude the possibility 
of radiographically occult process might be considered. Right 
central venous line tip is at the level of superior SVC.

transplantation on BEAM regimen, with home Bactrim and acyclovir 
prophylaxis held on admission and subsequently resumed per 
protocol. He received filgrastim treatment through his nadir, as 
well as supportive transfusions with pRBC and platelets. In the 
setting of poor appetite and oral mucositis, total parenteral 
nutrition was initiated. As his mucositis improved, he was 
transitioned back to PO and was tolerating comfortably. 
 
# Neutropenic fever: Spiked to 102.4 overnight ___ and to 
100.7 over the next day, but has remained afebrile until ___

recent baseline of 1, was likely prerenal in etiology in the 
setting of poor oral intake, with improvement to ___ 
throughout the rest of admission following IV fluid 
administration.
 
# Presyncope: He experienced lightheadedness on minimal 
ambulation within his room on ___, likely due to orthostatic 
hypotension in the setting of poor oral intake and anemia, with 
symptomatic improvement following supportive pRBC transfusion. 
Noncontrast head CT was negative for acute intracranial process.
  
# Afib with RVR: ___ at 10AM pt in afib with RVR to 120s. SBP 
stable in 130s and patient asymptomatic. No history of afib, 
unclear etiology, but possibly related to infection given fever 
or anemia given slowly downtrending hct. Resolved ___ after 
approximately 7 hours.  TSH normal. CXR PA/Lat without 
pneumonia.  He was started on metoprolol which he continued for 
several days, but discontinued prior to discharge.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,

It was a pleasure taking care of you at the ___.  You were 
admitted for a stem cell transplant with your on cells 
(autologous  transplant).  
 
You had a fever while your cell counts were low, so you were on 
antibiotics for several days and these have since been 
discontinued. You required several platelet and blood 
transfusions while you were here and you had a couple episodes 
of nose bleeding due to your low platelets.  Your counts 
recovered well and you began to more like your baseline, so you 
were discharged to the ___ with close follow up. 
 
 
While you were having a fever and had low blood counts, your 
heart went into a rhythm called atrial fibrillation. This 
resolved after several hours, but we had started you on a heart 
medicine called metoprolol to help control the rate.  You should 
follow up with your PCP to determine whether you need to 
continue taking this medication.

1.  Focal right occipital lobar sulcal FLAIR-hyperintensity 
concerning for subarachnoid hemorrhage.  Note that though the 
FLAIR sequence was obtained post-contrast administration and 
that, therefore, the sulcal hyperintensity could represent 
leptomeningeal enhancement, this is less likely, given the lack 
of convincing enhancement on post contrast T1-weighted SE and 
MP-RAGE sequences. In the absence of history of trauma, the 
possible etiologies include, but are not limited to, 
leptomeningeal amyloidosis and reversible cerebral 
vasoconstriction syndrome (RCVS, or ___ syndrome). 
2.  Chronic left caudate head infarction with ex vacuo 
dilatation of the left lateral ventricle. 

repeat MRI head:
IMPRESSION: 
1.  Previous FLAIR-signal abnormality is redemonstrated.  It is 
seen only on the post-contrast FLAIR images and is consistent 
with leptomeningeal 
enhancement, concerning for focal lymphomatous spread. This 
finding should be closely correlated with clinical and 
laboratory data, including results of most recent CSF cytology 
and flow-cytometry. 
2.  Sequelae of chronic small vessel ischemic disease. 
3.  Chronic left caudate head infarct with ex vacuo dilatation 
of the frontal horn of left lateral ventricle, re-demonstrated. 

CT head:
IMPRESSION: 
1.  Focal right occipital polar subarachnoid hemorrhage is seen 
better on the concurrent enhanced MR study. 
2.  Old infarct of the left caudate head, with cystic 
encephalomalacia and volume loss. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ is ___ with newly diagnosed mantle cell lymphoma s/p  
C1 CHOP who is presenting for HD MTX treatment in the setting of 
possible CNS involvement of lymphoma. 

# Mantle Cell Lymphoma:  The patient has newly diagnosed mantel 
cell lymphoma and is s/p C1 R-CHOP.  He has had recent retinal 
vein occlusion and is currently being worked up by optho at 
___.  Based on exams at ___, there is e/o subretinal 
deposits that are concerning for CNS involvement of the 
patient's lymphoma.  The patient had MRI and CT scan of the 
brain which initially did not show clear e/o lymphoma 
involvement, and instead showed evidence of subarachnoid 
hemorrhage (see below).  However, on repeat imaging prior to 
discharge, MRI showed e/o hyperenhancement c/w leptomenigeal 
involvement.  Both Optho and Neuro-onc evaluated the patient 
while in hospital.  After discussing the option, it was decided 
to do a lumbar puncture, and start high dose methotrexate for 
CNS involvement of lymphoma.

The patient's urine output and urine pH was monitored closely, 
and once methotrexate level was cleared and creat normalized 
(see below), he was dicharged home.

# MTX induced acute kidney injury: The patient had acute creat 
bump in the setting of high dose methotrexate despite having 
adequate urine output and urine pH between 7.5-8.  The patient's 
creat was trended and nephrotoxic agents were avoided and 
medications were renally dosed.  Renal was consulted; the 
patient's urine was also spun, and there was evidence of some 
crystals, as well as muddy brown casts.  It was thought that the 
patient could be having ATN in the setting of MTX therapy.  His 
creat was trending down upon discharge, and renal thought that 
it would continue to improve.  The patient should have his creat 
checked at his follow up visit on ___. 

# retinal vein occlusion: The patient had recent retinal vein 
occlusion.  Optho was consulted and the patient had Avastin 
injection on ___ in ___ clinic.  The patient will have 
outpatient follow up with Optho.  

# subarachnoid hemorrhage: The patient was found to have focal 
area of subarachnoid hemorrhage on MRI and head CT.  Unclear if 
this could be related to CNS involvement of his disease, though 
MRI was negative for any hyperenhancement which would suggest 
lymphoma.  He was monitored clinically.  The patient had repeat 
imaging as per Neuro-onc, specifically MRI with precontrast and 
postcontrast FLAIR series.  On repeat imaging, the patient was 
found to have hyperenhancement that was c/w leptomeningeal 
involvement.  

# Hypertension:  The patient is not on any medications at home, 
and his pressures were monitored while in house.  

Transitional Issues:
- The patient will have to have his creat checked as an 
outpatient.

Attending: ___
 
___ Complaint:
Scheduled admission for high dose cyclophosphamide
 
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

 
History of Present Illness:
___ year old man with mantle cell lymphoma/leukemia with CNS 
involvement who is being admitted for high dose cytoxan prior to 
stem cell mobilization.  He feels well and has no complaints.

Review of Systems:  
Denies fever, chills, night sweats, headache, vision changes, 
rhinorrhea, congestion, sore throat, cough, shortness of breath, 
chest pain, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, 
constipation, BRBPR, melena, hematochezia, dysuria, hematuria. 

PAST ONCOLOGIC HISTORY:  
Mr. ___ was noted for an elevated WBC count in ___. 
 He was going to follow up in the early part of ___ but had 
changed his PCP and was seen in ___ with increasing white 
blood count of ~35,000.  CT imaging done on ___, the 
results of which are not available.  PET/CT imaging on ___ 
showed mild to moderate FDG uptake within lymphadenopathy of the 
neck, bilateral axillae, retroperitoneal and inguinal areas.  
The spleen was diffusely enlarged with mild diffuse FDG uptake. 
Initial peripheral blood smear noted medium sized lymphocytes, 
no smudge cells, some cells (~10%) with more open chromatin and 
nucleoli.  The cells were CD ___ + with CD1 translocation felt 
consistent with mantle cell lymphoma. Because
of the high white count, there was concern for more aggressive 
leukemic component and he was initiated on CHOP on ___ 
with the plan to receive Rituxan with Dr. ___ primary 
oncologist. Around the same time of this workup, Mr. ___ was 
seeing his ophthalmologist for routine eye care, but also with 
noted changes of vision of the left eye.  He has an 
accommodating lens and was found to  have an occlusion of the 
distal branch of a retinal vein on the left.  Follow up from 
___ ophthalmology reported Choroidal cellular infiltrate in 
the left eye concerning for CNS involvement from his Mantle Cell 
lymphoma/leukemia.  He was admitted urgently on ___ for MRI 
imaging and LP, followed by high dose Methotrexate.  MRI imaging 
on ___ showed focal right occipital lobar sulcal 
FLAIR-hyperintensity concerning for subarachnoid hemorrhage, 
although leptomeningeal involvement was possible.  Repeat MRI 
imaging on ___ showed the previous FLAIR-signal 
abnormality but as it is seen only on the post-contrast FLAIR 
images, it is felt consistent with leptomeningeal enhancement, 
concerning for focal lymphomatous
spread.  LP done on ___ did not have adequate cells for
evaluation.  He was seen by Dr. ___ Neuro-Oncology as
well as Dr. ___ ophthalmology.  He received an 
intraocular Avastin injection on ___, second one on 
___ and ___ injection with laser treatment on ___. 

Because Mr. ___ has probable leukemic/blastic variant of 
mantle cell lymphoma, he is continuing with aggressive 
treatment. The plan has been to alternate R-CHOP with High dose 
Ara-C vs. R-DHAP with high dose methotrexate between each 
cycle(if tolerated by creatinine but the high dose methotrexate 
has been on hold).  He has completed treatment as outlined below 
and is now proceeding with autologous stem cell transplantation. 
 He underwent repeat bone marrow aspirate and biopsy on 
___ which did not show any evidence of mantle cell 
lymphoma/leukemia. Repeat LP was negative.  Echocardiogram on 
___ with EF of > 60%.  Pulmonary Function tests on 
___ with FVC 108%, FEV1 104%, and DLCO 89%.  

TREATMENT HISTORY:
 * ___ - C1 CHOP
 * ___ - Admitted urgently due to choroidal cellular 
infiltrate in the left eye concerning for CNS involvement from 
his Mantle Cell lymphoma/leukemia.  MRI imaging consistent with 
this. 
 * ___ - High dose methotrexate, complicated by acute renal 
insufficiency with creatinine peaking at 2.2 felt most likely 
from precipitation in the renal tubules.  Creatinine has 
trending downward, stabilizing at 1.5. Discharged on ___.
 * ___ and ___ - Received Rituxan in divided doses 
with mild reaction. 
 * ___ - High dose Ara-C.  Dose decreased to 1000 mg/m2 
due to his age and renal function; received 2 doses on ___, 1 
dose on ___ and 1 dose on ___.  On Neupogen support during 
nadir, required transfusion of red cells and platelets. 
 * ___ - C2 RCHOP 
 * ___ - High dose Ara-C.  Dose decreased to 1000 mg/m2 
due to age and renal function.  High dose MTX on hold with renal 
insufficiency.
 * ___ - C3 RCHOP
 * Restaging scan shows interval improvement of lymphoma. MRI of 
head with resolution of previous enhancement.  
 * ___ - High dose Ara-C.  Dose decreased to 1000 mg/m2 due 
to age and renal function.

auto transplant with recurrence, hypertension, CVA/CRVO, SSS s/p 
PPM, pAF on Eliquis, and convulsive syncope who presented from 
home for septic shock from pneumonia. 

ACUTE ISSUES 
=============== 
# SEPTIC SHOCK
# LLL PNEUMONIA
The patient presented with fever, leukocytosis, elevated 
lactate, hypotension and chest x-ray concerning for left lower 
lobe infiltrate concerning for sepsis secondary to pneumonia. 
Given his recent hospitalization and relative immunosuppression 
in the setting of his lymphoma he was covered broadly initially 
with vancomycin, cefepime and azithromycin. He was briefly on 
vasopressors and was given IV fluids. He was switched to 
cefpodoxime/azithromycin on day prior to discharge. He was 
discharged to complete a course of 5 days of azithromycin and 7 
days of cefpodoxime to end on ___.

# ___
Baseline Cr 1.0, on admission up to 1.6, likely prerenal in the 
setting of sepsis. With IVF and antibiotics, this decreased to 
close his baseline on discharge (1.1).

# RECURRENT MANTLE CELL LYMPHOMA
MB and LN biopsy ___ with recurrence of mantle cell 
lymphoma. Patient scheduled for PET scan and further treatment 
as outpatient. Immunoglobulins were measured and were remarkable 
for mild hypogammaglobulinemia. Hematology/oncology was 
consulted. He continued acyclovir prophylaxis.

# EPISODE OF L LEG WEAKNESS
He had an episode of left lower extremity weakness that could 
have occurred in the setting of hypotension and likely 
represents recrudescence of his prior stroke symptoms. This 
quickly resolved with resolution of his septic shock. 

CHRONIC ISSUES 
=============== 
# ATRIAL FIBRILLATION
# SSS S/P PPM
Apixaban was held when his creatinine function was diminished in 
setting ___ but resumed with recovered renal function. While 
apixaban was held he was continued on heparin drip.
# HYPERTENSION: Held home losartan 50 mg daily
# HYPERLIPIDEMIA: Continue atorvastatin 80 mg daily
# BPH: Holding home tamsulosin I/s/o hypotension
# OSA: On nocturnal CPAP at home, unclear settings

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: 
[] He was discharged to complete a course of 5 days of 
azithromycin and 7 days of Cefpodoxime to end on ___.
[] He should have short term follow up with heme/onc to discuss 
his recurrent mantle cell lymphoma and potential therapy 
(scheduled for ___. 
[] Monitor BPs outpatient; prior home losartan was held on 
discharge given hypotension this admission (on discharge SBP 
100-120s off this medication)- consider restart at heme/onc or 
PCP follow up

History of Present Illness:
Mr. ___ was noted for an elevated WBC count in ___. 
 In ___ his white cell count increased to ~35,000. PET/CT 
imaging on ___ showed mild to moderate FDG uptake within 
lymphadenopathy of the neck, bilateral axillae, retroperitoneal 
and inguinal areas.  The spleen was diffusely enlarged with mild 
diffuse FDG uptake. Initial peripheral blood smear noted medium 
sized lymphocytes, no smudge cells, some cells (~10%) with more 
open chromatin and nucleoli.  The cells were CD ___ + with CD1 
translocation felt consistent with mantle cell lymphoma. Because 
of the high white count, there was concern for more aggressive 
leukemic component and he was initiated on CHOP on ___ 
with the plan to receive Rituxan with Dr. ___ primary 
oncologist at the time.

Around the same time of this workup, Mr. ___ was seeing his 
ophthalmologist for routine eye care, but also with noted 
changes of vision of the left eye.  He has an accommodating lens 
and was found to  have an occlusion of the distal branch of a 
retinal vein on the left.  Follow up from ___ ophthalmology 
reported Choroidal  cellular infiltrate in the left eye 
concerning for CNS involvement from his Mantle Cell 
lymphoma/leukemia.  He was admitted urgently on ___ for MRI 
imaging and LP, followed by high dose ethotrexate.  MRI imaging 
on ___ showed focal right occipital lobar sulcal 
FLAIR-hyperintensity concerning for subarachnoid hemorrhage, 
although leptomeningeal involvement was possible.  Repeat MRI 
imaging on ___ showed the previous FLAIR-signal 
abnormality but as it is seen only on the post-contrast FLAIR 
images, it is felt consistent with leptomeningeal enhancement, 
concerning for focal lymphomatous spread.  LP done on ___ 
did not have adequate cells for evaluation.  He was seen by Dr. 
___ Neuro-Oncology as well as Dr. ___ 
ophthalmology.  He received an intraocular Avastin injection on 
___ and a second one on ___.  He will be due for ___ 
injection on ___.

Because Mr. ___ has probable leukemic/blastic variant of 
mantle cell lymphoma, he is continuing with aggressive 
treatment. The plan is to alternate R-CHOP with High dose Ara-C 
vs. R-DHAP with high dose methotrexate between each cycle(if 
tolerated by creatinine).

Mr. ___ is being admitted today for his next treatment with 
high dose Ara-C.

Treatment history:
* ___ - C1 CHOP
 * ___ - Admitted urgently due to choroidal cellular
infiltrate in the left eye concerning for CNS involvement from
his Mantle Cell lymphoma/leukemia.  MRI imaging consistent with
this. 
 * ___ - High dose methotrexate, complicated by acute renal
insufficiency with creatinine peaking at 2.2 felt most likely
from precipitation in the renal tubules.  Creatinine has 
trending
downward, stabilizing at 1.5. Discharged on ___.
 * ___ and ___ - Received Rituxan in divided doses
with mild reaction. 
 * ___ - High dose Ara-C.  Dose decreased to 1000 mg/m2 
due
to his age and renal function; received 2 doses on ___, 1 dose
on ___ and 1 dose on ___.  On Neupogen support during nadir,
required transfusion of red cells and platelets.
 * ___ - C2 RCHOP 
 * ___ - High dose Ara-C.  Dose decreased to 1000 mg/m2 
due
to age and renal function.  High dose MTX on hold with renal
insufficiency.
