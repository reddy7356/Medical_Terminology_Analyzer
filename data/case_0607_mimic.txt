Sigmoidoscopy ___
Findings:  
Mucosa: Diffuse continuous erythema, friability, and ulcerations
with contact bleeding were noted in the rectum, sigmoid colon 
and
descending colon. These findings are compatible with ___ 3
ulcerative colitis. Cold forceps biopsies were performed for
histology at the rectosigmoid.  
Impression: Erythema, friability, and ulcerations in the rectum,

obstruction.

Brief Hospital Course:
___ recent diagnosis of ulcerative colitis admitted for repeat 
flare symptoms after failing outpatient therapy for ulcerative 
colitis. He presented with repeat flare symptoms having failed 
outpatient oral steroid therapy. C. diff negative. Underwent 
flex sig ___ with biopsies for CMV, which were negative. He 
was given IV Solumedrol with a noticeable decrease in bloody 
bowel movements. He was tarted on infliximab initiation on 
___ and was continued on IV Solumedrol 20 mg IV q8 during 
hospitalization in addition to infliximab. His CRP continued to 
decrease with treatment. He was followed by gastroenterology 
while hospitalized. Colorectal surgery was also consulted during 
admission given his severe ulcerative colitis and need for 
future surgical intervention. He received 2 doses of infliximab 
in house. Despite initial improvement in his symptoms, he had 
recurrence after steroids were weaned to PO, with flex sig 
showing ongoing inflammation. Decision was ultimately made to 
pursue colectomy.

CHRONIC ISSUES
# Depression/Anxiety: Cont quetiapine, abilify, and lamotrigine.

# Hx of back pain: history of spinal fusion per patient, has
occasional back pain. Given Tylenol prn and Lidocaine patch prn

colorectal surgery service. Over the next several days we 
monitored him closely. When he had ileostomy function we 
advanced his diet from clear liquids to regular. We continued to 
slowly taper the steroids. When he was tolerating a regular diet 
and pain was controlled he was discharged home with nursing 
services to assist with ileostomy teaching.

and rectum, 
suggestive inflammatory versus infectious colitis. No evidence 
of obstruction.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,

___ were admitted to ___ for a pouch placement and had a new 
ileostomy created. 

Ileostomy
 ___ have a new ileostomy. The most common complication from a 
new ileostomy placement is dehydration. The output from the 
stoma is stool from the small intestine and the water content is 
very high. The stool is no longer passing through the large 
intestine which is where the water from the stool is reabsorbed 
into the body and the stool becomes formed. ___ must measure 
your ileostomy output for the next few weeks. The output from 
the stoma should not be more than 1200cc or less than 500cc. If 
___ find that your output has become too much or too little, 
please call the office for advice. The office nurse or nurse 
practitioner can recommend medications to increase or slow the 
ileostomy output. Keep yourself well hydrated, if ___ notice 
your ileostomy output increasing, take in more electrolyte drink 
such as Gatorade. Please monitor yourself for signs and symptoms 
of dehydration including: dizziness (especially upon standing), 
weakness, dry mouth, headache, or fatigue. If ___ notice these 
symptoms please call the office or return to the emergency room 
for evaluation if these symptoms are severe. ___ may eat a 
regular diet with your new ileostomy. However it is a good idea 
to avoid fatty or spicy foods and follow diet suggestions made 
to ___ by the ostomy nurses.  
Please weigh yourself daily and call the office if your weight 
decreases, as this may also be an indicator of high ostomy 
output and dehydration.
 Please monitor the appearance of the ostomy and stoma and care 
for it as instructed by the wound/ostomy nurses. ___ stoma 
(intestine that protrudes outside of your abdomen) should be 
beefy red or pink, it may ooze small amounts of blood at times 
when touched and this should subside with time. The skin around 
the ostomy site should be kept clean and intact. Monitor the 
skin around the stoma for bulging or signs of infection listed 
above. Please care for the ostomy as ___ have been instructed by 
the wound/ostomy nurses. ___ will be able to make an appointment 
with the ostomy nurse in the clinic 7 days after surgery. ___

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,

You were admitted to the hospital for a small bowel obstruction. 
You were given bowel rest and intravenous fluids. Fortunately 
your obstruction resolved after conservative management and you 
did not require placement of a nasogastric tube or operative 
management. You are now tolerating a regular diet, passing gas 
and bowel movements, and your abdominal pain is resolved. You 
may return to all usual home medications. If you have mild 
abdominal pain, you may take Tylenol. If you find that you need 
more than Tylenol to control any abdominal pain in the next few 
days, please call us to discuss whether you might need to return 
to the hospital.

If you have any of the following symptoms please call the office 
for advice or go to the emergency room if severe: increasing 
abdominal distension, increasing abdominal pain, nausea, 
vomiting, inability to tolerate food or liquids, prolonged loose 
stool, or extended constipation.

Our hope is that you will have a quick return to your life and 
usual activities. Thank you for allowing us to participate in 
your care!
