ECG:
Sinus rhythm. Left bundle-branch block. Compared to the previous 
tracing  
of ___ left bundle-branch block is new. 
  

Left Heart Cath (___):
COMMENTS:      
1. Selective coronary angiography of this left dominant system 
revealed 
three vessel CAD. The LMCA was normal. The LAD was diffusely 
diseased up 
to 50% stenosis, with a 70% diagonal stenosis. The LCX had 
moderate 
diffuse disease. The RCA was small, non-dominant with diffuse 
in-stent 
restenosis. 
2. Limited resting hemodynamics demonstrated systemic arterial 
hypertension, with BP of 185/93mmHg. 
  
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:     
1. Three vessel coronary artery disease. 

TTE:
The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. 
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal 
cavity size. There is moderate global left ventricular 
hypokinesis (LVEF = 35-40 %). Right ventricular chamber size is 
normal. with mild global free wall hypokinesis. The aortic root 
is mildly dilated at the sinus level. The aortic arch is mildly 
dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but 
aortic stenosis is not present. The mitral valve appears 
structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is 
no mitral valve prolapse. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure 
could not be determined. There is no pericardial effusion. 

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of ___, 
moderate global biventricular hypokinesis is now present c/w 
diffuse process (toxin, metabolic, etc., Multivessel CAD is also 
possible, but is less likely due to the diffuse/global 
dysfunction)

PA AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH: 
  
There are low lung volumes but the lung parenchyma appears 
clear. The 
cardiomediastinal silhouette and hilar contours are normal 
 

 

 

 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ yo male with h/o CAD s/p PCI to RCA ___, presents with jaw 
pain, fatigue, found to have new LBBB and troponin of 0.23.
.  
# CORONARIES:  High suspicion for ACS, troponin (+).  Given 
history, patient may have had recent event vs. active ischemia.  
LBBB new from ___, but unclear if new today.  Given history, 
managed for ACS upon admission.  Patient received ASA, plavix 
loaded, statin, heparin gtt.  He was also started on metoprolol 
tartrate and lisinopril for elevated BP.  Left heart cath was 
performed the following day and showed 3 vessel disease as noted 
above.  No intervention was perfomed.  The patient did not have 
recurrence of his symptoms.  He was discharged with ASA, Plavix, 
statin, ACEi, beta blockade and Metformin.  He will have primary 
care follow up in two days, and will see Dr. ___ on 
___.
.  
# PUMP: Preserved EF in ___, no evidence of systolic/diastolic 
dysfunction on exam, although history was consistent with some 
systolic dysfunction.  TTE obtained after cath did show 
decreased LVEF of 35-40% with global hypokinesis.  Discharge 
regimen is noted above.
.  
# RHYTHM:  LBBB on ECG.  There were no events on telemetry.  
Toprol XL was continued at discharge.
.  
# h/o Type II DM- Patient was initially covered with SS humalog. 
 He was discharged with Metformin, glyburide was discontinued.  
He was encouraged to use his glucometer to monitor his glycemic 
control.  He has close primary care follow up.
