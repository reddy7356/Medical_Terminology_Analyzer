Lumbar Spinal Stenosis

History of Present Illness:
___ gentleman who had described neurogenic claudication
as well as left leg atrophy and weakness.  He tried two sessions
of physical therapy without any improvement.  He is doing a lot
of exercises at home and walks daily; although, he is unable to
walk long distances secondary to his severe left leg pain and
weakness that happens after 5 minutes of walking.  He feels that
he is losing sensation as well as muscle bulk.  No bowel or
bladder dysfunction.

He got a new MRI of his lumbar spine, and it shows persistent
epidural lipomatosis on the basis of the prior left L5-S1
discectomy.  The disc that was there at the L4-L5 area on the
left seems to have become smaller, but it does seem to still be
severe compromised with the conus as the result of the epidural
lipomatosis.

The patient continues to be disabled from that.  I had a long
discussion with him and I recommended L4-L5 laminectomies for
decompression.  Risks and benefits were discussed, and he wants
to go ahead immediately after the holidays.  We will book it for
___.
