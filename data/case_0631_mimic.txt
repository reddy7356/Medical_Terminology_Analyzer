# Early Disseminated Lyme Disease:

Patient admitted with a week of fevers upto 102, chills, night 
sweats, malaise, intermittent headache, and progression of rash 
from a single 4cmX4cm circular erythematous, non-blanching one 
to multiple disseminated erythematous rashes. With the history 
of transient transaminitis a few days prior to admission and 
outdoor exposure with patient living in ___ and traveling in 
___, the sign and sympmtoms were clinically believed to 
be consistent with an early disseminated lyme disease(confirmed 
by lyme serology positive result avaialble after discharge). 
Patient was started on doxycycline. No signs/symptoms of 
carditits or meningitis. Given mild anemia during

non-hemolytic, making babesia less likely. Babesia smear was 
also negative. Anaplasma IgM/IgG test sent on admission was 
negative(result available after discharge). Started on 
doxycycline with improvement of symptoms. Discharged on 3 week 
course of doxycycline(day ___, day ___, per infectious
