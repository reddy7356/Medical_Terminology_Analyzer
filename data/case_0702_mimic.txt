Brief Hospital Course:
1. Cellulitis:  Pt has had recurrent Left lower extremity 
cellulitis of unclear precipitant that began in ___.  
She was last treated in ___ and presented with recurrent 
LLE pain, redness, swelling and night sweats.  The left shin had 
mild cellulitic changes and tenderness to palpation.  She was 
treated empirically with Vanc/Unasyn for 48hrs. The erythema and 
pain improved significantly with antibiotics and elevation.  Pt 
was transitioned to oral Bactrim/Keflex with the plan of 
completing a 10 day course. There was some evidence of tinea 
pedis and pt was started on Clotrimazole topically with plan for 
podiatry follow up.  Pt was given instructions about foot care 
and avoiding open toe shoes in an effort to prevent recurrent 
episodes of cellulitis.  

2. Hypertension: There was some confusion about her medication 
regimen. Pt had continued on Amlodipine despite the fact that 
her PCP had stopped it out of concern that it could be 
contributing to the lower extremity edema.  The medication list 
was reconciled with family, patient and PCP.  She was continued 
on Losartan at 25mg daily and amlodipine was stopped.  She was 
started on Hydrochlorothiazide 25mg daily and will be seen in 
follow up next week. 

Otherwise, pt was continued on her Metformin and Pravastatin 
home regimens.

Brief Hospital Course:
___ woman with h/o diabetes, HTN, HL who presents s/p fall with 
RLE edema and pain.

1. Cellulitis: Patient was admitted with right lower extremity 
edema, erythema, and pain. Patient had fall prior to 
presentation with abrasions, this most likely etiology of 
symptoms is cellulitis. Plain films negative for fracture. She 
was given ceftriaxone, usasyn, and vancomycin in the ED before 
being transferred to the floor. Given that patient has 
comorbidity of diabetes and is at higher risk for MRSA and 
gram-negative infection, she was switched on augmentin. Patient 
did not show any concerning signs of resistant infection, such 
as leukocytosis or fever and thus broader coverage was not 
necessary. Patient's symptoms improved overnight, and she was 
discharged home with augmentin, to be completed on ___ after 
a 10-day course. Her pain was controlled with percocet and 
ibuprofen.

2. Diabetes: Patient has type-II diabetes and is managed at home 
on metformin. Her last HbA1c in ___ was 6.7%. She was kept 
in-house on an ISS and told to restart her metformin when she 
was discharged home.

3. Hypertension: Patient presented to the floor from the ED with 
BP 180/100 because she had not taken her daily BP medications. 
She was restarted on all home meds on the floor, and her SBPs 
remained in her baseline range of 140s-150. She was discharged 
without any changed to her antihypertensive regimen.

4. Chronic LBP: Patient has had chronic LBP for many years, 
which is secondary to spasm. She states that her work makes this 
much worse, as she is on her feet all day. She was placed on 
ibuprofen standing with percocet prn for pain control, and this 
managed her symptoms well.

out neoplasm.

EGD: Normal stomach, duodenum and esophagus.
 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ y.o. Female with HTN, DM II, history of H. Pylori that was 
apparently treated who has cramping abdominal pain that has been 
occurring episodically since ___.  The patient has been having 
these symptoms since just after she moved to the ___ 
from ___.  

## Abdominal Pain: The patient was found to have severe cramping 
abdominal pain and tenderness to palpation at the epigastric 
region.  CT scan showed stranding and evidence of small bowel 
enteritis.  GI was consulted and an EGD was performed, which 
showed normal stomach, esophagus and duodenum with no evidence 
of an ulcer.  It was noted that the patient's symptoms began 
immediately after coming to the ___.  Most likely 
diagnosis is angioedema, secondary to potential c1 esterase 
deficiency.  The patient's lisinopril was stopped, and her 
symptoms resolved (probably a coincidence).  Follow-up with GI 
was arranged to discuss final test results.

## Endometrial thickening: Found incidentally on CT scan.  If 
clinical picture warrants, this should be followed up as an 
outpatient with a vaginal ultrasound.

## Benign hypertension: Lisinopril discontinued because of 
concern that it is causing angioedema.  Amlodipine started in 
place of it.

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted to the hospital with abdominal pain.  Because 
of the severity of your pain, we were concerning about an ulcer 
and you had a camera inserted down your esophagus to look at 
your stomach.  Your stomach looked entirely normal, however we 
took some tissue samples in order to rule out infection.

You had a CT scan of your belly, which showed that there was a 
lot of fluid and inflammation around your small bowel.  Our 
stomach doctors came and saw ___, and they believe that this was 
caused by one of the blood pressure medications that you were 
on, lisinopril.  For this reason, we sent off several blood 
tests to confirm this.  You will need to come to see the stomach 
doctors in their office to get the results of these tests.  

We have taken you off of your lisinopril, and started you on a 
different medication called amlodipine for your blood pressure.  
You should not take lisinopril for the time being until you see 
the stomach doctors.  ___ have made no other changes to your 
medications.

Please take all medications as prescribed, and keep all of your 
follow-up appointments.
