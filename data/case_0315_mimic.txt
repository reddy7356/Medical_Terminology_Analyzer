secretions
-MRSA screen PENDING

IMAGING:
CXR (___): Low lung volumes with persistent bibasilar 
streaky opacities likely reflective of atelectasis.  Fractures 
of the right eighth and ninth lateral ribs with increased right 
lateral pleural thickening and probable small right pleural 
effusion, new in the interval. 
 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ M with no sig PMH who presented with subjective fevers, 
night sweats, dyspnea/cough for 1 month, as well as right-sided 
pain ___ rib fracture and new epigastric pain in setting of 
known pneumonia.

#Fevers/shortness of breath/cough
#Community acquired pneumonia
Pt presented with persistent cough and pain despite treatment of 
CAP. Seen by PCP and treated with cefuroxime and steroids 
followed by ED evaluation and discharge with levofloxacin prior 
to this admission. Upon evaluation, CTA was negative for PE and 
demonstrated "ground-glass and ___ nodular opacities 
within the lower lobes bilaterally." Flu and other viral resp 
studies were negative. Sputum stain unremarkable. Low concern 
for TB given recent reported neg TB screen and no risk factors. 
He was treated with IV ceftriaxone and azithromycin x2 days (to 
complete 8 day course), as well as standing guaifenesin, 
codeine, and tessalon. His cough improved greatly. Upon 
discharge, MRSA swab was still pending. Since he had received 
more than a full course of antibiotics with atypical coverage, 
no further antibiotics were necessary. Ultimately we treated him 
with cough suppressants and pain medications, and his sx 
improved. Pt was discharged on cough suppressive regimen, with 
instructions to taper use after 3 days.

#Epigastric/Right-sided pain: Most likely related to known rib 
fractures dx on CT and/or other MSK strain in setting of violent 
coughing. No PE on CTA. EKG without ischemia. Pt was given 
standing ibuprofen and acetaminophen to avoid splinting and was 
encouraged to use incentive spirometry.

#Syncope: Pt reported episode of LOC in setting of coughing fit- 
most likely vasovagal. No history of cardiac disease. EKG WNL. 
Not orthostatic.

#Transitional issues:
-CT showed nodular opacities measuring up to 6 mm in the right 
lower lobe, which should be followed up with a chest CT in ___ 
months if the patient is at low risk for lung malignancy, or ___ 
months if the patient is at high risk.
-Patient given a few days supply codeine for cough suppression 
at discharge; if symptoms do not improve, he may need a refill. 
Also written for nystatin for thrush.
