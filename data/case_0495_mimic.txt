IMAGING: 

CTA Head and Neck ___:
1. Subtle small scattered small hypodensities within the 
cerebellum and 
brainstem, better evaluated on recent prior MRI of the head, 
consistent with acute infarctions ___ the posterior circulation. 
2. Complete occlusion of the mid to distal basilar artery with 
absence of 
right superior cerebellar and anterior inferior cerebellar 
arteries. There is severe atherosclerotic disease of the left 
vertebral artery and basilar artery with irregularity of the V4 
segment of the left vertebral artery. Findings are consistent 
with complete occlusion secondary to severe atherosclerotic 
disease. 
3. Diffuse irregularity ___ the intracranial arteries, 
particularly at the 
right M2 segment and bilateral carotid siphons, without evidence 
of high-grade narrowing. 
4. Diffuse moderate atherosclerosis of the neck vasculature with 
narrowing of the bilateral internal carotid artery origins, 22% 
on the right and 10% on the left, but NASCET criteria. 

TTE ___
The left atrial volume index is mildly increased. No atrial 
septal defect or patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color 
Doppler or saline contrast with maneuvers. There is mild 
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size 
and global systolic function (LVEF>60%). Due to suboptimal 
technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be 
fully excluded. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall 
motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear 
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic 
stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve 
appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. 
The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. 
There is no pericardial effusion. 
IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Normal global 
biventricular systolic function. No cardiac source of embolism 
seen. No pathologic valvular abnormalities..

ECHO ___
Sinus rhythm. Left atrial abnormality. A-V conduction delay. 
Compared to the previous tracing of ___ no diagnostic 
interim change. 
  
NCHCT ___
Redemonstrated is hyperdensity of the basilar artery, 
particularly 
at the terminus with extensive calcification, consistent with 
patient's known  thrombus within the basilar artery.  There 
appears to be interval progression of hypodensity along the 
midbrain and cerebellum, concerning for worsening ischemia ___ 
these regions.  No acute hemorrhage is identified.  The basilar 
cisterns are patent.  There is no evidence of herniation. No 
acute fracture is identified.  Secretions are seen ___ the 
oropharynx. There is mucosal thickening of the maxillary sinuses 
bilaterally.  The frontal sinuses and sphenoid sinuses 
demonstrate mild air-fluid levels and mucosal thickening. The 
mastoid air cells and middle ear cavities are clear. IMPRESSION: 
Interval progression of hypodensity ___ the midbrain and 
cerebellum is concerning for worsening ischemia.  No evidence of 
herniation. 

CXR ___: Compared to the prior radiographs the lung volumes are 
stable. There is no focal opacity, pleural effusion or 
pneumothorax. The cardiomediastinal contours are stable. 

CXR ___: 
___ comparison with the earlier study of this date, of the 
endotracheal tube has been removed and replaced with a 
tracheostomy tube that appears to be well as positioned without 
evidence of complication. The patient is somewhat oblique when 
compared to the previous study. This may account for the 
apparent increased opacification at the right base. There does 
appear to be some relative elevation of the right 
hemidiaphragmatic contour.  A ___ the appropriate clinical 
setting, the possibility of volume loss ___ the right lower lung 
could be considered. 

CXR ___: 
Tracheostomy tube appears ___ unchanged position. As does 
right-sided PICC 
line. The lungs remain clear with no focal consolidation to 
suggest pneumonia. Central pulmonary vasculature is full but 
less so than on the ___ film and no peripheral edema is 
evident. 
 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ HOSPITAL COURSE

Mr. ___ was admitted to the neurology ICU after being found to 
have a basilar artery thrombus resulting ___ several small 
ischemic strokes, ___ the bilateral cerebellar hemispheres as 
well as a right thalamic infarct, and question of right 
transverse sinus thrombosis on MRV (now thought to simply be a 
fenestration).

He was started on a heparin gtt for PTT goal of 50-70. He was 
placed with HOB flat with goal BP 140-180. He did well 
initially, on exam with gaze-evoked nystagmus bilaterally, and 
bilateral ataxia, although full strength. However, around 5pm on 
the day of admission, he was found to be somnolent with new 
onset skew deviation (left eye down and right eye with severely 
restricted eye movements), pinpoint pupils and left-sided 
weakness. Neosynephrine was started for goal SBP 180-200. He was 
taken for STAT NCHCT and CTA and neurosurgery was called. NCHCT 
showed new midbrain/pontine infarcts, and CTA was unchanged. 
Neurosurgery did not want to intervene given the time frame 
since onset and the very high risk of embolizing more thrombus 
with manipulation.  Lipid panel showed LDL 81. HbA1c 7.0%. TTE 
wnl.

___ the setting of the new infarct, he developed worsening 
repiratory status and by ___ had acute desaturations to the ___ 
requiring intubation.  BAL done on ___ grew out pan-sensitive 
coag positive staph aureus and he was placed on IV antibiotics 
(vanc/cefepime weaned to levofloxaxin)  He remained intubated on 
minimal ventilator settings but an attempt at extubation ___ 
failed.  He is s/p trach/PEG on ___.  

He was off pressor since ___, maintaining sBP > 140's.  Exam 
continued to improve and he was transferred to the floor on ___. 
  

========================================

STROKE NEUROLOGY FLOOR COURSE (by systems)

# NEUROLOGY: 
With regards to his stroke, he continued to show improvement 
with signs of subtle movement on the left side.  He would also 
engage with the examiner (please see above for most recent 
exam).  For anticoagulation, he was maintained on heparin gtt 
(PTT goal 50-70) and coumadin was started with first dose given 
___.  His INR was 1.9 on discharge (not at goal of ___.  PLease 
stop heparin once INR ___. His blood pressure goals were 
liberalized to 110-180 and he did not require medications to 
achieve this.  His activity level was liberalized as well. His 
atorvastatin was continued.  

# ___ :
His home antihypertensives were not restarted give liberal blood 
pressure goals of 110-180.  He was maintained on atorvastatin.  
Systemic anticoagulation as described above.

# PULMONARY: 
Trach was placed ___ ICU. His Levofloxacin was continued to treat 
his known MSSA PNA.  This should continue through ___. 

# ID: 
He did spike a fever on ___ (with leukocytosis that had remained 
___ during entire hospital course).  Repeat panculture and CXR 
did not show new infection and PNA was not seen on CXR.  
Antibiotics were not rebroadened and there were no subsequent 
fevers.  He continued on Levofloxacin at time of discharge.

pulmonary venous pressure.  Opacification at the left base most 
likely
represents atelectatic changes with possible small effusion.

CXR (___) - FINDINGS:
Over left lower lung field increased opacification is seen 
concerning for
aspiration or worsening pneumonia
No signs of pulmonary edema.
The cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits .
No pleural effusion.
IMPRESSION:
Left lower lung opacification concerning for aspiration / 
pneumonia.

 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ y/o M with PMHx HTN, s/p CVA with resultant hemiplegia and 
pseudobulbar and bulbar findings also with dysarthria and 
dysphasia, bilateral vocal fold atrophy, a right vocal fold 
paresis, secondary muscle tension dysphonia who was admitted for 
bridging anticoagulation with heparin gtt in the setting of 
planned ENT surgical intervention on ___. Post-operative course 
complicated by bleeding and hematoma formation, requiring return 
to the OR, as well as overt aspiration. Despite recommendations 
for NG or PEG for alternative feeding route, the patient 
adamantly declined, as he had these in the past and it was not 
consistent with his goals of care. This was discussed 
extensively with him and his wife on numerous occasions.

# PRIOR BRAINSTEM STROKE / VOCAL CORD ATROPHY: With hemiplegia, 
bulbar and pseudobulbar findings, as well as bilateral vocal 
cord atrophy and right vocal cord paresis, admitted for planned 
medialization laryngoplasty left and right. He was admitted for 
perioperative bridging with heparin gtt. Underwent bilateral 
medialization laryngoplasty ___. Was placed back on heparin gtt 
and Coumadin post-operatively; however, this was complicated by 
bleeding / hematoma. He is now s/p evacuation of hematoma and JP 
drain placement. H/H since stable. He was restarted on 
anticoagulation and bridged back to coumadin. He received 1 week 
of augmentin/unasyn post-op. His drain was pulled on ___. He 
continued to struggle with phonation post-op, although this may 
improve over time per ENT. He will f/u with ENT in clinic. He 
has steristrips in place, which will fall off over time. 

#Anticoagulation:
Became supratherapeutic (3.3 from 2.0 the prior day) once 
restarted on home coumadin dose (6 mg 4x weekly, 3 mg 3x 
weekly). Coumadin held on ___ and restarted at 3 mg on  ___. 
INR 2.7 on ___. Antibiotics and being NPO probably contributed. 
Patient has home POC INR machine at home and will titrate 
closely, working with ___ clinic. For now recommended 3 mg 
daily, although pending values over upcoming days may return to 
closer to home dosing.

# ASPIRATION: Noted to have several episode of coughing and 
severe desaturation after eating. He was seen by ___ who noted 
aspiration and recommended NPO. The patient was not in agreement 
with NGT or PEG. Therefore, he was placed on IVFs while NPO. No 
significnt suspicion for pneumonia, likely because patient 
already on augmentin at time of aspiration event and lacked a 
clinical picture suggestive of infection. Swallowing was 
reassessed after several days but not found to be improved. 
Patient preferred to eat with risk of aspiration rather than 
consider feeding tube. Made recommendations for safest modified 
diet considering this preference after multiple extensive 
discussions (honey/ground diet, aspiration precautions, 
continued SLP therapy at home)

# HYPERTENSION
# Bradycardia
Continued lisinopril. Atenolol reduced from 50 to 25 due to 
bradycardia, which subsequently improved from ___ to 
___. BP remained in 110s-150s, may need further titration as 
outpatient.

# HLD: On statin.

#Thrombocytopenia:
Mild. Slightly improved during admission. Follow-up as 
outpatient

#Leukocytosis:
Worsening on HD3, subsequently improved although mildly elevated 
at time of discharge. Low suspicion for infection. Can monitor 
as outpatient

========================================
Transitional issues:
(1) close monitoring of INR and close communication with 
___ clinic about dose adjustments (patient checks INR at 
home with POC machine and discusses with ___ clinic) - for 
now is on 3 mg daily, but will likely require uptitration back 
toward prior dosing of ___
(2) honey thickened/ground diet, aspiration precations, home SLP 
therapy. Contined discssions as outpatient abot goals of care 
and nutrition.
(3) follow-up with primary care scheduled and ENT follow-p to be 
schedled
(4) repeat CBC in follow-up given mild thrombocytopenia and mild 
lekocytosis
(5) evaluation of drain wound (R neck) in follow-up; steristrips 
can be allowed to fall off on their own

Discharge Disposition:
Home With Service
 
Facility:
___
 
Discharge Diagnosis:
History of stroke
Vocal Cord Atrophy / Paresis
Aspiration/Dysphagia
Hypoxia
Low platelets
Low heart rate

 
Discharge Condition:
Alert and interactive, but with significant dysphonia. Reduced 
functional status from his baseline. Hemodynamically stable. 

 
Discharge Instructions:
You presented to the hospital for heparin bridging in 
anticipation of your planned ENT surgery. Your postoperative 
course was complicated by bleeding requiring repeat surgery. 
Your course was also complicated by episodes of aspiration. 
Because of this aspiration, you were made NPO and placed on IV 
fluids. After several days, we reassessed your swallowing and 
found that you were still aspirating. Based on your preference 
to absolutely avoid a feeding tube of any sort and to take the 
risk of aspirating with eating food, we recommended that you 
take a modified diet with honey thickened liquids and ground 
solids. We also recommend supplemental oxygen until your oxygen 
levels have recovered.

You INR rose very quickly when restarted on coumadin, most 
likely because of your antibiotics and reduced oral intake. 
Therefore for now we have reduced your dosing to 3 mg daily. 
However this will likely be increased in the future, and over 
the next ___ weeks you should monitor closely and be in close 
communication with your ___ clinic. 

Of note we reduced your atenolol dose due to low heart rates. 
Your blood pressures have been overall in a reasonable range 
despite this change, but you should continue monitoring the 
blood pressure and if elevated then you may need a different 
blood pressure medication instead.

History of Present Illness:
per Dr. ___ admission note:
Mr. ___ is a ___ M w PMHx of HTN, HLD, DM, and basilar 
thrombosis with resultant infarcts in the cerebellum, pons, and 
midbrain ___ ___ who is transferred to ___ for new 
worsening dysarthria and right sided weakness.

Mr. ___ was hospitalized at ___ from ___ to ___ 
after presenting with a basilar artery thrombus resulting in 
several small ischemic strokes in the bilateral cerebellar 
hemispheres and R thalamus. During that complicated hospital 
stay, Mr. ___ was initially managed in the ICU with 
anticoagulation for his basilar artery thrombus. Unfortuantely, 
he developed new mibrain and pontine infarctions. He was 
severely debilited and underwent trach and PEG on ___. He was 
discharged on coumadin for his basilar artery thrombus. He was 
then switched to apirin 325mg one month ago after a repeat CTA 
was stable.  
Mr. ___ is accompanied by his wife, who provides the below 
history. She states that on ___, Mr. ___ had an episode of 
diarrhea but was otherwise well. The diarrhea persisted on ___ 
and he asked to take a nap in the early afternoon. When he awoke 
from his nap, his wife noted that he appeared generally weaker 
and had difficulty eating his lunch - it took a great effort to 
chew and swallow and he was also drooling quite a bit. She also 
notes that his speech was ever so slightly more dysarthric (she 
can usually understand approximately 90% of what he says, on 
___ it was 80%). Mr. ___ also complained of a headache a 
that time which is very unusual for him. Ms. ___ then called 
EMS, and Mr. ___ presented to ___ with 
worsening dysarthria and weakness. A ___ performed in the ED 
there was without hemorrhage or obvious signs of new stroke. He 
was admitted to the hospital after neurology noted chronic L 
sided weakness and new RUE/RLE UMN weakness and noted they 
recommended an MRI for further evaluation.  

On the morning of ___, Mrs. ___ states that she thinks Mr. 
___ was ever so slightly improved from the day prior. He was 
able to take is breakfast without too much difficult and he did 
well working with ___. His speech was also nearly back to 
baseline. She does note that he had a low grade temperature that 
day to 100.7.

At around noon, however, she noticed a worsening in Mr. ___ 
condition. He was drooling, unable to chew his lunch, and unable 
to suck through a straw for liquids. She also reports that his 
speech began to get much worse at this time. From noon until 4PM 
he continued to worsen, becoming weaker and more dysarthric. She 
estimates that at its worst, she could only understand 10% of 
what he was saying at that he was speaking one word or even one 
letter at a time.

Mr. ___ did have an MRI at ___ at approximately 
4PM on ___. MRI demonstrated show new small L midbrain 
infarct; MRA redemonstrated know cerebrovascular disease. He was 
subsequently transferred to ___ as he has received his prior 
neurology care here.

Mr. ___ is unable to participate in full ROS, pertinent 
findings are noted above.

IMAGING:
MR/MRA head (___)
IMPRESSION: 
1. Slightly increased size of the brainstem infarct compared to 
MRI from ___, with a new area of infarct just 
inferior to the pons in the right pontomedullary junction 
(series 6, image 8).
2. Limited MRA due to patient motion. Occlusion of the basilar 
artery and near complete occlusion of the V4 segment of the left 
vertebral artery are similar to MRA from ___. The 
superior cerebellar and posterior cerebral arteries are not 
visualized on the current MRA, although resolution is limited on 
the current study and no infarcts are identified within these 
territories on current MRI. If there is a need to evaluate the 
intracranial vasculature with better resolution, CTA could be 
considered.

XR Elbow (___)
FINDINGS: 
 
There is soft tissue swelling over the olecranon.  This is 
nonspecific but could reflect olecranon bursitis.  Lateral view 
is oblique, limiting assessment for joint effusion. No acute 
fracture or bone lesion is seen. Joint spaces appear preserved.

 
Brief Hospital Course:
# NEURO: ___ was transferred from ___ with 
symptoms of worsening dysarthria and a new pontine stroke 
demonstrated on MRI. His symptoms were at first attributed to 
hypoperfusion due to hypotension in the setting of known basilar 
artery thrombus, but upon review of records from his 
hospitalization prior to transfer there was no recorded 
hypotension. Despite maintaining permissive hypertension during 
the current admission he had the subsequent expansion of his 
infarct, demonstrated on repeat MRI. He was thus started on 
heparin gtt as bridge to coumadin. He will need to remain on 
coumadin until his outpatient Vascular Neurology followup. His 
risk factors were again measured and his LDL was 25 and A1c was 
5.7%. He failed his swallow study due to severe dysphagia so a 
PEG tube was placed. He was evaluated by ___ and OT who 
recommended acute rehab to address his right sided weakness and 
ataxia as well as his severe dysarthria. On ___ he started 
Coumadin, but will be discharged to rehab on heparin drip (goal 
PTT 50-70, no boluses) until INR therapeutic. His home Aspirin 
325mg daily was stopped in hospital due to alternate use of 
anticoagulation; will consider restarting at outpatient 
neurology follow-up. 

# CARDIOVASC: Permissive hypertension was maintained for 
majority of hospitalization, then home meds (lisinopril and 
atenolol) were restarted. On discharge he was still 
intermittently hypertensive to SBP 150s-180s. Thus, increased 
atenolol from 25mg daily to 50mg daily (home dose) on day of 
discharge. Will need BP monitoring at rehab to aim for final 
goal SBP 130-140. 

# PSYCH: Patient was intermittently tearful and depressed during 
hospitalization, with a pseudobulbar affect at time. This may 
have been some degree of post-stroke depression but also suspect 
symptoms are pseudobulbar secondary to involvement of mibrain 
and pons in stroke. Started fluoxetine 10mg daily during 
hospitalization. 

# RHEUM: He developed swelling over his left elbow concerning 
for olecranon bursitis. He was evaluated by rheumatology who 
performed a joint aspiration which confirmed bursitis. This was 
managed with supportive care. 

-----------------
TRANSITIONS OF CARE:
- Needs daily INR monitoring while uptitrating Coumadin 
- Goal SBP 130-140, may need antihypertensives uptitrated, 
increased Lisinopril from 20mg daily to 30mg daily on discharge

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,
You were hospitalized due to symptoms of slurred speech and 
right-sided weakness resulting from an ACUTE ISCHEMIC STROKE, a 
condition in which a blood vessel providing oxygen and nutrients 
to the brain is blocked by a clot. The brain is the part of your 
body that controls and directs all the other parts of your body, 
so damage to the brain from being deprived of its blood supply 
can result in a variety of symptoms.
Stroke can have many different causes, so we assessed you for 
medical conditions that might raise your risk of having stroke. 
In order to prevent future strokes, we plan to modify those risk 
factors. Your risk factors are:
 - basilar artery thrombus
 - high blood pressure
 - high cholesterol
 - diabetes

We are changing your medications as follows:
- restarting coumadin

Please take your other medications as prescribed.

Please followup with Neurology and your primary care physician 
as listed below.

It was a pleasure providing you with care during this 
hospitalization.
