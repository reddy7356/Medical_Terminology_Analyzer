Brief Hospital Course:
Summary: Mr ___ is a ___ with a history schizophrenia admitted 
___ for worsening
paranoia in the context of medication nonadherence and lack of 
outpatient psychiatric treatment.

#Schizophrenia: On admission, Mr ___ presented with persecutory 
and paranoid delusions about becoming the target of crime in his 
area.  He had not filled his prescriptions following his prior 
hospitalization in ___, raising concern about medication 
nonadherence.  Further complicating this, he repeatedly 
expresses a distrust of doctors ___ to "lean towards 
[his] faith"), which has led him to avoid engaging with 
outpatient providers at any time since onset of his illness.  As 
such, he exclusively relies upon urgent care and emergency 
services when paranoia worsens.  

Risperidone was initiated and dose was titrated to 3mg BID 
without adverse effects.  His paranoia was observed to decrease 
considerably, and accordingly, he expressed feeling ready for 
discharge. He was also observed to have increased range of 
affect, decreased isolation, and increased engagement with the 
treatment team.

Despite repeated attempts to appeal to his stated personal needs 
and preferences, Mr. ___ was very resistant to accept 
outpatient follow up (suggestions included referral to a PACT 
team, Center Club, and outpatient psychiatry/therapy/case 
management). He expressed a concern about losing his 
independence with such services and preference to live as a 
"hermit." Similarly, he declined decanoate formulations such as 
Risperdal Consta or Invega at this time, but he agreed to 
consider them further if readmitted to the hospital in the near 
future due to decompensation in the context of medication 
nonadherence. At the time of discharge, he agreed to consider 
future referral to ___ and requested that his follow up 
be scheduled with Dr. ___.  

#Safety:  Patient denied SI/HI and remained in good behavioral 
control throughout admission.  He was monitored on q15 minute 
checks without incident.

#Medical: He denied vital signs while inpatient, so reported 
history of hypertension could not be confirmed or monitored. No 
medical issues arose during his care. He declined referral to 
primary care.

Brief Hospital Course:
Legal: ___
#Schizophrenia: On admission, patient demonstrated significant 
paranoia with reports of someone being after him and believing 
that "people out there have guns and knives, so the only safe 
place is the hospital." He was notably flat, withdrawn, and 
extremely guarded. Eye contact was unable to be assessed as 
patient wore sunglasses for the entirety of his hospitalization, 
donning a cap for the last three days. Given previous response 
to risperidone, as was the case in ___, patient was 
started on risperidone tablets 1 mg PO bid. This was uptitrated 
to 3 mg PO bid, as he was previously noted to respond well to 
this dose. Patient willingly took said medications, however, did 
not have insight into their purpose. When asked if he was 
feeling more "safe" and less paranoid after re-starting 
risperidone, he stated that the "threat is in the community and 
that the medication doesn't affect that." Patient denied 
experiencing any side effects from the medication.  
 
Due to his known medication non-adherence, with prior history of 
having received injectable medications, re-initiation of IM 
medications was discussed with patient at length. Patient 
received Risperdal Consta 25 mg IM x1 on ___ (next due ___ 
without event.  

Patient was started on clozapine during this hospitalization, 
titrated up to 50mg in the morning and 100mg at night with no 
side effects. Patient initially refused to have his blood drawn 
for monitoring (stated "it's against [his] religion") but 
consented to procedure day before discharge. ___ value was 6.1, 
down from 9.2 on admission, but ___ was within normal limits at 
3.1. Patient was considerably less paranoid and agitated after 
initiation of clozapine. Patient endorsed feeling more safe, and 
admitted to sleeping a few hours a night. Prior to clozapine, 
patient too paranoid to sleep for fear of nursing staff "offing 
[him]" at night. Would consider this an effective medication for 
patient's symptoms.
 
At time of discharge, patient was provided with prescriptions 
for risperidone 3mg QHS, Risperdal CONSTA 25mg IM, 
diphenhydramine 50mg TID for EPS, and clozapine 200mg QHS. 
Patient agreed to return to ___ on ___ at 2pm for 
his next CONSTA administration with Dr. ___. Patient also 
agreed to return weekly to the outpatient lab on ___ 
for ___ monitoring.

2) Medical:
Similar to previous admissions, patient refused to give vital 
signs during his hospital stay. As a result, patient’s reported 
history of hypertension could neither be confirmed nor 
monitored. There were no acute medical issues. Patient declined 
referral to primary care.
 
3) Social/Milieu/Collateral:
Similar to prior admissions, patient remained generally 
isolative and quiet while admitted. He was cooperative with 
nursing and met with his treatment team daily, though declined 
participation in any groups. He was paranoid on admission, but 
this was noted to decrease over the course of his hospital stay. 
Patient was noted to be intense in his interactions, but was 
redirectable. Often answered questions with “yes, m’am/no, 
ma’am” or “yes, sir/no, sir." He was monitored on q15 
minute checks without incident, and with no need for chemical or 
physical restraint.

4) Risk Assessment:
No evidence of an acute safety risk at this time. Due to his 
limited insight into his illness, patient carries the risk of 
chronic treatment non-adherence. We attempted to mitigate this 
risk with a long-acting injectable medication in addition to a 
new medication (clozapine) that made patient more amenable to 
follow up. There is no evidence for suicidality, homicidality, 
aggressive, or unsafe behavior at this time.

5) Disposition
Patient has been living in the same home for the last ___ years, 
a sub-section of a multiunit house overseen by his uncle. He has 
limited interaction with his uncle, but he is content to return 
to his dwelling. Patient understands that if he feels unsafe in 
the future, as he did upon presentation to the hospital last 
week, he should return to the ED.

engageable and interactive with staff.  Pt has never attempted 
to harm himself, and continues to deny any SI.  His acute risk

to get him, somewhat irritable mood with patient guarded on 
examination. 
.
Diagnostically, etiology of presentation is likely secondary to 
primary psychotic disorder-- although he does carry a diagnosis 
of schizoaffective disorder vs. bipolar, he does not appear 
depressed and he is certainly not manic on examination. Does 
appear paranoid with some negative symptoms (somewhat withdrawn, 
concrete thought process) but with thought process that is 
mostly linear, goal oriented; he also appears to be attending to 
his ADL's adequately. Nothing on physical examination that would 
suggest an underlying medical condition is contributing to his 
current presentation. Toxicology screen was negative, although 
patient did endorse intermittent cannabis use-- this may be 
playing a role in worsening his paranoia. 
.
Regardless of diagnosis, given concern for decompensated 
psychosis with inability to care for himself in the community, 
he was found to meet inpatient level of care for stabilization 
of symptoms, discharge and safety planning. 
.
1. LEGAL & SAFETY: patient was admitted to ___ on a 
___, upon admission he did sign a conditional voluntary 
form, which was rejected due to possible lack of capacity.  
However, patient was willing to sign a conditional voluntary 
form later in admission, which was accepted and in place until 
discharge.  He was found to be in adequate behavioral control, 
appropriate for 15-minute checks, which he remained on 
throughout admission while remaining unit restricted.
.
2. PSYCHIATRIC:
#.  Schizophrenia
Upon admission, patient demonstrated delusions/paranoia that 
others are out to get him, somewhat irritable mood with patient 
guarded on examination. Patient was initially offered 
Risperidone upon admission to treat the above stated symptoms, 
and this medication was well-tolerated and eventually 
up-titrated to a final dose of 3 mg BID upon discharge. This 
medication was helpful for the patient's paranoia and  
irritability, and upon discharge patient's MSE was notable for 
pleasant and appropriate mood and conduct, denial of suicidal or 
homicidal thoughts, and reported feelings of safety to return to 
the community. The patient was also offered Ativan as needed for 
agitation and anxiety, which he often utilized appropriately 
with good effect. This medication was continued upon discharge 
at a dose of 1 mg PO BID as needed for anxiety with 
recommendation to continue to taper as clinically indicated. The 
patient was also prescribed Diphenhydramine for to aid in 
mitigating side effects from antipsychotic medication, which the 
patient found to be helpful for tremor without major side 
effects, and he was prescribed a total of 50 mg TID as needed by 
time of discharge. 
.
3. SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS:
Patient denied any significant substance use history other than 
occasional cannabis use, from which he was counseled to remain 
abstinent. 
.
4. MEDICAL
#. HTN: Patient normotensive on this admission
Patient was found to be with no hypertension on this admission, 
and we recommended that he follow up with his PCP regarding this 
upon DC.
.
#. Type II DM: per OMR, patient denies history of diabetes
HbA1c was found to be 5.7% during admission, and we recommended 
that the patient follow up with his PCP with regards to this. 
.
5. PSYCHOSOCIAL
#) GROUPS/MILIEU:  
The patient was encouraged to participate in the various groups 
and milieu therapy opportunities offered by the unit. The 
patient rarely attended these groups. The patient was somewhat 
isolative, but fairly visible within the milieu without ever 
demonstrating angry outbursts or inappropriate conduct with 
peers or staff. 
.
#) COLLATERAL INFORMATION AND  FAMILY INVOLVEMENT
With the patient's written consent, we sent a records request to 
___ detailing his previous admission. Patient was 
admitted there from ___ until ___ for a decompensation 
of underlying schizophrenia. He was prescribed Risperidone 4 mg 
QHS upon discharge with Diphenhydramine 50 mg TID and Trazodone 
100 mg QHS. He was isolative and guarded, but otherwise his 
admission was without major behavioral control issues.   
.
#) INTERVENTIONS
- Medications: Risperidone, Diphenhydramine, Ativan
- Psychotherapeutic Interventions: Individual, group, and milieu 
therapy.
- Coordination of aftercare: follow up with psychiatry and PCP 
___. 
.
INFORMED CONSENT: Risperidone
The team discussed the indications for, intended benefits of, 
and possible side effects and risks of starting this medication, 
including tardive dyskinesia, metabolic syndrome and EPS, and 
risks and benefits of possible alternatives, including not 
taking the medication, with this patient. We discussed the 
patient's right to decide whether to take this medication as 
well as the importance of the patient's actively participating 
in the treatment and discussing any questions about medications 
with the treatment team. The patient appeared able to understand 
and consented to begin the medication.
.
RISK ASSESSMENT & PROGNOSIS
On presentation, the patient was evaluated and felt to be at an 
acutely elevated risk of inability to care for self based upon 
paranoia and disorganization. His  factors noted at that time 
include chronic mental illness, recent discharge from an 
inpatient psychiatric unit, history of violence, male gender, 
single relationship status, unemployment, financial hardship, 
chronic medical illness, psychosis,
disorganized and unpredictable behavior, medication 
noncompliance, poorly controlled mental illness, lack of 
engagement with outpatient treatment, poor reality testing, and 
limited coping skills. The patient's modifiable risk factors 
were addressed via medication adjustment, stabilization within a 
therapeutic milieu, and aftercare coordination. Finally, the 
patient is being discharged with many protective risk factors, 
including his help-seeking behavior, life satisfaction, 
future-oriented viewpoint, and lack of suicidal ideation. 
Overall, the patient is not at an acutely elevated risk of 
inability to care for self due to acutely decompensated 
psychiatric illness. Thus, I feel the patient does not meet 
section 12a criteria for inability to care for self at this 
time.

Brief Hospital Course:
Legal: ___
Psychiatric: On admission, patient demonstrated significant 
paranoia with reports of someone being after him and feeling 
“unsafe out there.” He was notably flat, withdrawn, and 
extremely guarded. He made extremely poor eye contact and 
demonstrated severely delayed speech with appearance of internal 
preoccupation (though patient denied any AVH/CAH). Given 
previous response to risperidone, with family report that 
patient has a history of cheeking medications, patient was 
started on risperidone disintegrating tablets 1 mg PO bid. This 
was quickly uptitrated to 3 mg PO bid, as he was previously 
noted to respond well to this dose. Patient was also started on 
lorazepam 1 mg PO bid given his severe paranoia and concerns for 
mild catatonia. With initiation of medications, patient was 
noted to become significantly more engaged. He had improved eye 
contact, and became more conversant with the primary team. He 
also became increasingly less paranoid over the course of his 
brief hospital stay, leading him to state consistently his 
readiness for discharge home. 
 
Due to his known medication non-adherence, with prior history of 
having received injectable medications, re-initiation of IM 
medications was discussed at patient with length. He initially 
was amenable to Invega Sustenna, which was recommended due to 
his extremely poor history of follow up. Patient subsequently 
retracted his consent, insisting on Risperdal Consta, stating 
repeatedly that “Risperidal is my medication.” At his 
insistence, patient ultimately received Risperdal Consta 25 mg 
IM x1 on ___ (next due ___ without event. Consistent with 
previous admissions, he reported repeatedly that he would follow 
up with ___ for his biweekly injections, 
though patient has demonstrated repeatedly that he does not 
follow up with any discharge plans, including medications, after 
hospital discharge. Phone call to ___ prior to discharge also 
revealed that patient has not been seen at ___ since ___, and 
the ___ floor clinic is only available by appointment 
for patients with an established ___ PCP (which patient does not 
have). Patient repeatedly declined referrals for PCP, case 
management, and psychiatric follow up. He also repeatedly 
declined referrals for home nursing or ___ services, stating 
repeatedly, “I’m a hermit. I ___ need any of that.”
 
At time of discharge, patient was provided with a one-month 
prescription for Risperdal 3 mg bid.  He was offered home 
delivery of these medications, which he declined. Patient was 
informed of his inability to follow up at ___, but he again 
declined referrals of any kind. Per discussion with attending 
Dr. ___ agreed to return to the emergency room if 
feeling unsafe in any way. Patient further agreed to continued 
IM medications and referrals for follow up the next time he is 
admitted to ___.
 
Medical: Consistent with previous admissions, patient refused 
all vital signs during his hospital stay. As a result, patient’s 
reported history of hypertension could neither be confirmed or 
monitored. There were no acute medical issues. Patient declined 
referral to primary care.
 
Social/Milieu: Consistent with previous admissions, patient 
remained quiet and generally isolative while admitted. He met 
with his treatment team daily, though declined participation in 
any groups. He was paranoid on admission, but this was noted to 
decrease over the course of his hospital stay. Patient was 
polite with staff (frequently answering questions with “yes, 
m’am/no, ma’am” or “yes, sir/no, sir). He was monitored on q15 
minute checks without incident, and with no need for chemical or 
physical restraint.
 
Risk Assessment: No evidence of an acute safety risk at this 
time. Due to his limited insight into his illness, patient does 
have the chronic risk of treatment non-adherence. We attempted 
to decrease this risk with long-acting injectable medications, 
which was started this admission, though patient is declining 
follow up at this time. He also declines referrals to any 
medical or mental health providers. Future medication 
non-adherence is expected, and there is no evidence for 
suicidality, homicidality, aggressive, or unsafe behavior at 
this time.
