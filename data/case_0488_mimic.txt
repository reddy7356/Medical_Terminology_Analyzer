IMAGING/STUDIES
================
CTA ___ ___
IMPRESSION:
1. Massive acute bilateral pulmonary emboli with severe
associated right heart strain. I discussed this with Dr. ___ issuing this report.
[Bilateral large central emboli in R and L main pulmonary
arteries extending into upper, lower and R middle lobes]

2. Indeterminate left lower lobe abnormality for which a CT PET
study should be considered for further assessment when the
patient is stable.

3. Small hypodense right hepatic lesion, incompletely
demonstrated at the inferior margin of the field-of-view but not
definitely change where demonstrated dating back to ___. With a
central density measurement of -1 Hounsfield units, is most
likely is a small cyst or other benign finding.

4. Likely benign left thyroid lesion.

LENIs ___ at ___
IMPRESSION: The examination is positive for deep venous
thrombosis in the left popliteal and gastrocnemius veins. 

___ CTA CHEST: 
1.  Limited examination secondary to bolus timing and streak 
artifact from the patient's breasts.  The clot burden appears 
mildly decreased since prior however.  Right heart strain is 
still appreciated as evidenced by leftward bowing of the 
intraventricular septum. 
2.  New bilateral consolidations, some of which may reflect 
pulmonary 
infarcts.  Superimposed infection would be hard to exclude 
however. 
3.  A hypodense nodule in the left lobe of the thyroid gland 
measures 3.1 cm.  Thyroid ultrasound may be performed when 
clinically appropriate. 

___ TTE:
CONCLUSION: There is no evidence for an atrial septal defect or 
right-to-left shunt on color Doppler or agitated saline at rest. 
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal. Moderately 
dilated right ventricular cavity with mild global free wall 
hypokinesis. There is mild [1+] tricuspid regurgitation. There 
is SEVERE pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. Compared with 
the prior TTE (images reviewed) of ___ , the image 
quality is slightly improved; the right ventricle is more 
dilated and estimated PA systolic pressure is now increased (but
could reflect better measures due to image quality). There is no 
inter-atrial communication by saline contrast injection.

___ CT CHEST W/O CONTRAST:
1. Dense consolidations within the dependent portion of the 
upper and lower lobes bilaterally the have progressed compared 
to the CT dated ___, however evaluation for 
pulmonary infarction is limited without IV contrast.  Of note, 
the lung parenchyma was homogeneous enhancing on the CT dated ___, likely reflecting atelectasis, however underlying 
infection or infarction cannot be excluded on the current 
examination. 
2. Moderate right and small left pleural effusions, increased 
compared to 
prior. 
3. Multiple prominent mediastinal lymph nodes are likely 
reactive. 
4. Unchanged 3.1 cm hypodense nodule within the left lobe of the 
thyroid. 
  
RECOMMENDATION(S):   Thyroid nodule.  Ultrasound follow up 
recommended. 
___ College of Radiology guidelines recommend further 
evaluation for 
incidental thyroid nodules of 1.0 cm or larger in patients under 
age ___ or 1.5 cm in patients age ___ or ___, or with suspicious 
findings. 
  
Suspicious findings include: Abnormal lymph nodes (those 
displaying 
enlargement, calcification, cystic components and/or increased 
enhancement) or invasion of local tissues by the thyroid nodule. 


___ TTE:
The left atrial volume index is normal. There is no evidence for 
an atrial septal defect or right-to-left shunt on color Doppler 
or agitated saline at rest. There is mild symmetric left 
ventricular hypertrophy with a normal cavity size. There is 
normal regional left ventricular systolic function. There is no 
resting left ventricular outflow tract gradient. Mildly dilated 
right ventricular cavity with depressed free wall
motion. Tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE) is 
depressed. There is abnormal interventricular septal motion c/w 
right ventricular pressure and volume overload. The aortic sinus 
is mildly dilated with normal ascending aorta diameter for 
gender. There is a normal descending aorta diameter. The aortic 
valve leaflets (?#) are mildly thickened. There is no aortic 
valve stenosis. There is no aortic regurgitation. The mitral 
valve leaflets are mildly thickened with no mitral valve 
prolapse. There is trivial mitral regurgitation. The pulmonic 
valve leaflets are not well seen. There is mild pulmonic valve 
stenosis. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. 
There is mild [1+] tricuspid regurgitation. There is mild 
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial 
effusion. Suboptimal image quality. Compared with the prior TTE 
(images reviewed) of ___, there is an elevated gradient 
across the pulmonic valve detected suggesting mild pulmonic or 
supravalvular stenosis.

 
Brief Hospital Course:
==================
SUMMARY STATEMENT:
==================
___ female with PMHx of obesity, presenting as a 
transfer from ___ with bilateral massive pulmonary 
emboli with severe RH strain s/p EKOS catheter-directed 
thrombolysis, prolonged hypoxemic/hypercarbic respiratory 
failure requiring intubation, course c/b ARDS, and S. Aureus 
VAP. 

=============
ACUTE ISSUES:  
============= 
# Massive PE with severe RH strain
Patient presented with bilaterally submassive PE, likely ___ 
obesity and immobility in setting of pain from knee 
osteoarthritis. Later found to be mildly protein C deficient 
which additionally likely contributed. Patient underwent EKOS 
directed thrombolysis on admission. Subsequently developed signs 

of obstructive shock (cool extremities, hypotension with 
increasing pressor requirement), concerning for evolution into 
massive PE. Patient ultimately required intubation due to 
worsening hypoxemic/hypercarbic respiratory failure. Repeat CTA 
showed mildly decreased clot burden despite respiratory failure. 

Patient was anticoagulated with heparin gtt throughout ICU 
course. She was intubated and initially required high fio2 and 
high PEEPs, but after a few weeks her ventilator settings 
improved and she was weaned to high flow. On discharge, she was 
on 5L oximizer and breathing comfortably. She was intermittently 
diuresed to improve her volume status, but given she had 
adequate urine output after stopping diuresis, was not 
discharged on a diuretic. Should monitor volume and respiratory 
status daily while at rehab and diurese as necessary.

 
#Acute hypoxemic/hypercarbic respiratory failure
#S.aureus VAP 
#ARDS
Following EKOS catheter directed thrombolysis, patient was noted 

to have worsening respiratory failure refractory to iNO, NIPPV, 
diuresis and was intubated ___. She developed imaging 
concerning for ARDS and sputum cx with MSSA c/f S. aureus VAP, 
for which she was treated. She had a course of cefazolin from 
___. Repeat CT on ___ showed significant 
dependent opacities. For ARDS managemnet, patient was ventilated 
with low tidal volumes, paralyzed, proned, treated with veletri, 
and diuresed aggressively with bumex. She was able to be 
extubated and was discharged on oximizer as above.
 
# Hypercalcemia
# Hyperphosphatemia: Thought to be in the setting of immobility. 
Should monitor these lab values while in rehab.

====================
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
====================
[] Antithrombin, FVL, Prothrombin
[] Follow up with protein C deficiency and hypercoagulable 
workup
[] Thyroid nodule on CT Chest, recommend US for follow-up
[] Follow up with Dr. ___ after discharge to 
have thromboembolic disease ___ need repeat TTE 
for this 
[] L>R pupil, has had CT non-con that was unremarkable 
[] PCP ___. E-mail PCP with 
major updates 
[] Hypercalcemia - suspect due to immobility, but should follow 
up these labs weekly
[] Home valsartan was held and can be re-started once PCP 
determined BPs stable to re-introduce.

REPORTS 

___ Imaging CHEST (PORTABLE AP) 
1. Linear opacities in the right lower lung likely represent 
atelectasis, 
however infection cannot be excluded in the appropriate clinical 
setting. 
2. Low lung volumes with mild bibasilar atelectasis. 
3. Persistent small right pleural effusion. 
4. Mild pulmonary edema 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. ___ is a ___ with a history of b/l massive pulmonary 
emboli with severe R heart strain and obstructive shock (dx 
___, s/p catheter directed thrombolysis), and 
hypoxemic/hypercarbic respiratory failure requiring intubation 
c/b VAP/ARDS, who presents with three weeks of epistaxis. 

ACUTE ISSUES:
=============
#Epistaxis 
Patient has a history of nose bleeds preceding anticoagulation 
previously requiring cauterization. These have been attributed 
to her NC usage, but hemostasis this time was compromised by 
anticoagulation and ASA. She is hemodynamically stable and her 
respiratory status is stable/improving. Was taking ASA 81 mg 
daily until ___, but no clear indication. Removed nasal packing 
___. Stopped enoxaparin ___, as warfarin is therapeutic. 
Supplemental O2 with humidified face tent (goal 88-92%) to 
prevent further mucosal irritation. Agree with stopping ASA 
permanently (no indication). No further epistaxis. 

#Hx of massive PE
Massive PE diagnosed in ___ s/p cathter-directed 
thrombolysis. Discharged on Apixaban, but transitioned to 
warfarin ___ with enoxaparin dose. Last INR checked ___ and 
subtherapeutic, so warfarin dose increased to 8 mg daily. INR 
2.2 on admission. Stopped enoxaparin ___ after ~48 hrs of 
therapeutic warfarin. Continued warfarin 8 mg daily (Goal INR 2 
- 3). Discharge INR 2.7

#Hypoxemic/hypercarbic respiratory failure 
#Asthma
Patient is at her baseline supplemental oxygen requirement. 
Received one dose of Cefepime in the ED for ?PNA; however, she 
does not appear clinically to be infected. ___ have a history of 
OHS/OSA; followed by pulm outpatient. CXR on admission shows 
mild pulmonary edema, which may also be contributing. Has RV 
failure given ___ PEs, but unclear if there is a degree of LV 
diastolic dysfunction, as well. Symptomatic with orthopnea, so 
diuresed with IV furosemide. Continued home duonebs/albuterol 
nebs. Humidified face tent; goal SpO2 88-92% given chronic CO2 
retention. 

#Positive blood culture 
Gram positive cocci in pairs and clusters noted in 1 bottle on 
___. Very high suspicion for contaminant. No fevers or 
hemodynamic instability. Fepeat BCx with no growth to date by 
discharge. 

CHRONIC ISSUES:
===============
#Lower extremity edema 
Significant lower extremity edema. Likely multifactorial (RV 
strain w/ thromboembolic disease and venous stasis). Held 
Torsemide 20 mg daily while giving IV furosemide. Increased dose 
to 40 mg daily on discharge. 

#HTN
Previously on losartan. Stopped iso obstructive shock with PE.
Not currently requiring antihypertensives. 

# CODE: full (MOSLT in chart) 

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES
===================
- If requiring supplemental oxygen (for goal SpO2 88-92% given 
chronic CO2 retention), would prefer humidified O2 via face tent 
to prevent nasal mucosal irritation and further epistaxis. 
- Consider outpatient echo to evaluate for for LV diastolic 
dysfunction. 
- Increased Torsemide to 40 mg daily. Please monitor lytes and 
Cr and adjust based on daily weights and volume status. 
- Patient should be on warfarin indefinitely.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,

You came into the hospital because you were having nosebleeding. 
 This is most likely related to your blood thinners and 
irritation from supplemental oxygen.  Lovenox was stopped 
because your warfarin level was appropriate.  He was given 
humidified oxygen with a stent.  You are also given medication 
to remove extra water from her lungs that may have contributed 
to your low oxygen level.

When you leave the hospital you should:
- Take all of your medications as prescribed.
- Attend all scheduled clinic appointments.
- If you develop another nosebleed, apply pressure to your nose 
for 20 minutes. If the bleeding is significant, you are choking 
on blood, or the bleeding will not stop, then you should come 
back to the emergency department.

It was a pleasure taking care of you, 
Your ___ Care Team

 
Followup Instructions:
