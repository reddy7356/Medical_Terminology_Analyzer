___ EKG: 
Sinus rhythm with A-V conduction delay and atrial premature 
beats including
a non-conducted atrial premature beat. Right bundle-branch 
block. Left axis
deviation may be due to left anterior fascicular block and/or 
prior inferior
myocardial infarction. Left ventricular hypertrophy. ST-T wave 
abnormalities
may be due to left ventricular hypertrophy or possible ischemia. 
Clinical
correlation is suggested. Since the previous tracing of ___ 
inferolateral
ST-T wave abnormalities have decreased
.
___ Echo: 
The left atrium is elongated. There is mild symmetric left 
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and 
regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%). There is no left 
ventricular outflow obstruction at rest or with Valsalva. Right 
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The 
aortic arch is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are 
mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic 
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly 
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Physiologic mitral 
regurgitation is seen (within normal limits). There is mild 
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial 
effusion. 

IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with 
preserved global and regional biventricular systolic function. 
Pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. Dilated aortic arch. 
Compared with the prior report (images unavailable for review) 
of ___, the left ventricular cavity is now smaller with 
improved global systolic function. Pulmonary artery hypertension 
is now present. 
. 
___ CXR: 
 
PA AND LATERAL CHEST: There is no focal consolidation, and no 
effusion or
pneumothorax. Cardiac silhouette is top normal in size, with 
left ventricular
contour. The aorta is unfolded. There is no pulmonary vascular 
congestion or
edema. Degenerative changes are seen in the thoracic spine.
 
IMPRESSION: Top normal to mildly enlarged cardiac silhouette, 
with prominent
left ventricular contour. No acute cardiopulmonary process.

___ EKG: 
Sinus bradycardia with A-V conduction delay. Left atrial 
abnormality.
Right bundle-branch block. Left axis deviation may be due to 
left anterior
fascicular block and possible prior inferior myocardial 
infarction. Left
ventricular hypertrophy. ST-T wave abnormalities may be due to 
left
ventricular hypertrophy but cannot exclude ischemia. Clinical 
correlation is
suggested. Since the previous tracing of ___ atrial ectopy 
is absent.
Otherwise, no significant change.
 
Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ is a ___ year old male with a past medical history 
significant for DM, HTN, and dilated cardiomyopathy (EF 40-45% 
in ___ who presented after a syncopal episode in church.   
.
# Syncope: In the ED, the patient's EKG showed sinus arrhythmia 
and evidence of prior ischemia. A rhythm strip taken 20 minutes 
later was normal sinus rhythm with 1st degree AV delay. The 
patient was followed on telemetry, which was notable for  PACs 
with occasional blocked ventricular conduction and 1st degree AV 
delay. He was bradycardic with heart rates ~55 but was 
asymptomatic. A TTE was also performed, which showed mild LVH, 
normal systolic function with an EF > 55%, improved from 40-45% 
on prior study in ___. The Echo also showed pulmonary artery 
hypertension, which was a new finding.  During this admission, 
he denied dizziness, diaphoresis, chest pain, palpitations, 
shortness of breath, nausea, or vomiting. He did not have any 
further syncopal episodes. The syncope was believed to be a 
vasovagal episode given the history of precedent symptoms. The 
patient was discharged with cardiology follow-up. 
.

was given a diabetic diet, sliding scale insulin, and his home 
dose of metformin (1000 mg PO BID). His finger-stick glucose 
readings were 111-178.

medications: amlodipine 10 mg qday, hydralazine 100 mg TID, 
Imdur 240 mg qday, labetalol 100 mg BID, and lisinopril 50 mg

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___, 
It was a pleasure caring for ___ at ___ 
were admitted because of a syncopal episode. We watched your 
heart rate overnight and did not see anything concerning. Blood 
tests showed that there had been no heart attack that caused the 
episode. It is likely that this was a vasovagal episode, or a 
"fainting episode" that was caused by a combination of factors: 
eating very little in the morning, feeling warm, and blood 
pressure medications. We also performed an ultrasound of your 
heart, which showed improved function since your Echo in ___. 
___ will follow-up with Dr. ___, to discuss 
the Echo results and also the new finding of pulmonary artery 
hypertension. 
. 
We made no changes to your medications. 
. 
Your follow-up appointments are listed below.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,

You were admitted to the hospital because you had a very low 
heart rate. A pacemaker was placed so that your heart would beat 
at a safe rate. You were discharged home following the procedure 
and should follow the instructions on the post-pacemaker 
instruction sheet provided to you.

Please make the following changed to your medications:

1. START Cephalexin 500mg by mouth every 6 hours for two days.

Please take all other medications as previously prescribed and 
please keep your follow-up appointments.
