History of Present Illness:
Pt is an ___ y/o M with PMHx of COPD, BPH, spinal stenosis, as 
well as recurrent UTI (2 recent admissions for UTI), here with 
altered mental status at home. Of note, at the time of my 
interview, pt is somewhat confused about how he got to the 
hospital, so history is somewhat limited.

Pt was recently admitted to ___ ___ and ___ with 
UTI. He was recently treated with zosyn, which he completed 
approximately 1 week ago. Pt had been discharged to rehab but 
has since gone home. He reports doing well at home until the 
night prior to presentation. That night, he awoke to urinate; 
however, he had an episode of urinary incontinence prior to 
arriving in the bathroom. He also endorses a mechanical fall on 
his way to the bathroom (slid to the ground while having trouble 
navigating his walker, no head strike, no LOC, no prodromal 
symptoms). He reports that EMS was called, helped him up, but 
did not bring him to the hospital at that time.

The events of the morning of presentation are unclear to the 
patient, however. Per ED report, he noted to be disoriented at 
home.

Spiked temp to 104.6 in the ED. He was also noted to have a 
cough and to be hypoxic. Initial ED read of the CXR was also 
concerned for multifocal PNA, for which abx were started.

lightheaded. He endorses chronic dyspnea, but feels that his 
breathing is below baseline currently. He also reports a dry 
cough which he first noted today. Denies any F/C.

ROS: As above. Denies headache, sore throat, sinus congestion, 
chest pain, heart palpitations, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, 
constipation, muscle or joint pains, focal numbness or tingling, 
skin rash. The remainder of the ROS was negative.

ultimately grew pan-sensitive pseudomonas (see above).  After 
discussing with ID, pt was transitioned to ciprofloxacin for ___OPD: Continued on albuterol/ipratropium nebs prn.  Continued 
Advair, Spiriva.  Of note, pt did have some episodes of hypoxia, 
which resolved with deep breathing.  CXR x 2 without evidence of 
acute process.

# Hypertension: Pt was continued on amlodipine.

identified in this area to explain the gastric 
distension. Further evaluation with endoscopy should be 
considered. 
2. Multiple bilateral lower lobe pulmonary nodules, largest in 
the right lower lobe measuring up to 1.1 cm in size with a 
concerning appearance. Further evaluation with dedicated chest 
CT is recommended to image the remainder of the chest. 

EGD: 
Friability and erythema in the fundus
Small amount of retained food particles in stomach.
The gastroscope passed easily into the stomach and into duodenum

Brief Hospital Course:
Pt is a ___ y.o male with h.o COPD, spinal stenosis, BPH, CAD who 
presents with weakness, confusion, and incontinence, found to 
have UTI, hospitalization complicated by gastric outlet 
obstruction as well as acute encephalopathy.

Acute Issues:
#Sepsis due to urinary tract infection, with associated acute 
encephalopathy -likely accounted for weakness, confusion, 
incontinence. Pt was initially given IV ceftriaxone which was 
converted to PO cipro after culture returned with pan sensitive 
pseudomonas. Foley placed given PVR ~600 and pt unable to void. 
Plan to tx for complicated UTI for one week, s/p treatment..  

#urinary incontinence and urinary retention with h.o 
BPH-retention likely due to BPH, incontinence likely due to 
overflow and UTI. We placed a foley and started flomax. He will 
need a voiding trial at rehab and  Urology f/u as outpt.  

#gastric outlet obstruction- He developed nausea on HD #3, and 
was found to have a gastric outlet obstruction.  Symptoms were 
alleviated by NG tube for 8 hours, he refused longer.  He 
underwent CT to evaluate the cause, with no mass identified, and 
EGD with free passage of the scope into the duodenum.  The 
etiology of the obstruction was unclear, but he was 
symptomatically improved, tolerating a low residue diet.  He 
should have GI follow up to further evaluate both for symptoms 
and the cause.

Hypertension:  Noted to have hypertension, and started 
amlodipine.  Further review of records reveal orthostasis, and 
amlodipine will be discontinued at discharge.

Chronic issues:
#hyperlipidemia-continued statin.

#neuropathy/chronic pain-oxycodone and lyrica restarted as 
mental status improved

#COPD/chronic bronchitis-no acute flare. Continue outpt 
spiriva/inhalers.  HE did have episode of hypoxia, improved 
without intervention, with no findings on chest xray.

#GERD-PPI
.
Transitional issues:
GI follow for gastric outlet obstruction
Chest CT for lung nodules, discussed with PCP (already known 
with review of Atrius records)
Voiding trial, urology follow up

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted with weakness, incontinence and nausea. You 
were found to have a UTI and were given antibiotics with 
improvement in your symptoms. You were retaining urine in your 
bladder and had foley catheter placed. You also likely have a 
viral infection and were treated supportively. You were 
evaluated by physical therapy who recommended rehab after 
discharge.
.
Your blood pressure ran high, as it does at home - but we will 
not treat you with anything to avoid low blood pressures.

CXR (___):
IMPRESSION:  Low lung volumes with no acute cardiopulmonary 
process.

CXR (___):
IMPRESSION:  
Right PICC tip is in thecavoatrial junction. Cardiac size is

collection is identified.

Brief Hospital Course:
___ y/o M w/ PMH of BPH, HTN, spinal stenosis, and severe COPD 
who presents for AMS in setting of low BP.

ACTIVE ISSUES:
==============
# Pre-syncope
AMS described as period being "dazed" without neurologic deficit 
in context of a transiently low BP when assessed by EMS. 
Initially orthostatic on admission, improved s/p IVF. No reports 
of true syncope. No e/o to suggest stroke/TIA or seizures. 
Dehydration and low BPs likely driven by UTI, described below. 
Pt otherwise improved with no further symptoms and no events on 
telemetry.

# Complicated UTI w/ Pseudomonas
Grew cipro resistant pseudomonas in setting of foley 
catheterization pt has had since last admission. Previously 
treated with cipro for 1 week before present presentation. Also 
grew Enteroccous though low colony. Predisposed to infection 
given had chronic foley due to urinary obstruction since last 
discharge. Foley was removed with replacement held given pt 
passing voiding trial. Pt was otherwise without fevers, white 
count or CVA tenderness on admission. Renal US normal without 
abscess. Originally treated with cefepime for a 14d course 
(___) based on sensitivities but transitioned to Zosyn 
once enterococcus grew out that was ampicillin resistance to 
allow for administration of single IV antibiotic. Last dose of 
antibiotic for course to be ___, allowing for sufficient 
coverage for enterococcus. Recommend continued follow-up of UA 
and UCx upon completion of antibiotic therapy.

# ___ 0.35% on admission suggestive of pre-renal etiology due to 
UTI. Improved renal fxn to baseline after IVF. Renal US was 
normal.

# Urinary Obstruction
Since prior admission, plan to f/u w/ urology this week for 
further studies at ___. No evidence of re-obstruction after 
voiding trial was performed. Continued on tamulosin with plan 
for outpatient f/u with urology as planned.

# HTN
Elevated on admission with readings consistently >160, 
uptitrated amlodipine from 2.5mg to 5mg with continued 
optimization as an outpatient.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
====================
- Continue IV Zosyn for 14 day course ___, stop ___ 
via PICC (changed from cefepime to zosyn to cover both 
Pseudomonas and Enteroccocus)
- Please check UA and Urine Culture after completion of 
antibiotics to ensure clearance of infection
- Please check Cr on ___ to ensure renal function still 
stable, may need dose adjustment of zosyn as needed
- Ensure follow-up with urology since had issues with urinary 
obstruction w/ f/u arranged at ___
- Needs continue optimization of blood pressure, just changed 
from 2.5mg to 5mg of amlodipine on ___ need further 
increase of medications

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,

You were admitted to the hospital because you were confused with 
dehydration and low blood pressure. This was likely caused by 
your urinary tract infection with a bacteria called pseudomonas 
that became resistant to the medication you were taking before. 
As a result, your antibiotic was changed and had a PICC line 
placed to get it intravenously. You will continue the 
antibiotics for a total of 14 days.

Please make sure you follow-up with your primary care doctor 
___ after leaving the hospital. He will make sure your labs 
are normal and, at the end of the antibiotics, make sure you 
cleared your infection.

You should also continue to follow-up with your urologist at 
___ to manage your urinary obstruction.

Take care.

- Your ___ Team
