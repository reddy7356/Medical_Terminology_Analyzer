Brief Hospital Course:
The patient presented to the emergency department and was 
evaluated by the orthopedic surgery team. The patient was found 
to have right femoral shaft fracture. After evaluation by the 
acute care surgery team, it was determined that the patient had 
no other injuries. He was, therefore, admitted to the orthopedic 
surgery service.  The patient was taken to the operating room on 
___ for open reduction and internal fixation of his right 
femur with intramedullary nail, which the patient tolerated well 
(for full details please see the separately dictated operative 
report). The patient was taken from the OR to the PACU in stable 
condition and after recovery from anesthesia was transferred to 
the floor.  The patient was initially given IV fluids and IV 
pain medications, and progressed to a regular diet and oral 
medications by POD#1. The patient was given perioperative 
antibiotics and anticoagulation per routine.  The patient worked 
with ___ who determined that discharge to home without further ___ 
was appropriate. The ___ hospital course was otherwise 
unremarkable.

At the time of discharge the patient was afebrile with stable 
vital signs that were within normal limits, pain was well 
controlled with oral medications, incisions were 
clean/dry/intact, and the patient was voiding/moving bowels 
spontaneously. The patient is weight bearing as tolerated in the 
right lower extremity, and will be discharged on enoxaparin for 
DVT prophylaxis.  The patient will follow up in two weeks per 
routine. A thorough discussion was had with the patient 
regarding the diagnosis and expected post-discharge course, and 
all questions were answered prior to discharge.
