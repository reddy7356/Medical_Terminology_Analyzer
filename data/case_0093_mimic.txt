This ___ gentleman suffered a

reconstruction in his left leg, at the level of the knee
joint, with a right saphenous vein graft.  He did well for a
number of years, but recently has developed severe disabling
claudication.  An arteriogram was done and this showed his
superficial femoral and above-knee popliteal arteries to be
patent.  The popliteal artery at the knee joint and involving
the entire below-knee popliteal artery was totally occluded.
There was reconstitution of an anterior tibial and peroneal
and posterior tibial arteries distally; however, they were
not all connected to one another.  The best target vessel
appeared to be the posterior tibial artery.
