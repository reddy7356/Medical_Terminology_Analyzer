MICROBIOLOGY
============

IMAGING/STUDIES
===============
CT abd//pelvis w/ contrast ___ OSH:
1. Findings consistent with ruptured ectopic pregnancy. This 
could be cornual ectopic pregnancy. Evidence of active 
extravasation in right hemipelvis.

CTA chest ___ OSH:
1. Evaluation limited by patient's diffuse atelectasis in lower 
lobes. No central or lobar PEs identified. Distal segmental PEs 
cannot be completely excluded.
2. Diffuse atelectasis with air bronchograms through lower 
lobes. Underlying infectious process cannot be excluded. Areas 
of consolidation/atelectasis also seen within RUL.

CT abd/pelvis w/o ___ OSH: 
1. Blood identified within abdomen and pelvis. Overall volume of 
blood smaller today than yesterday. 
2. Significant bibasilar airspace disease which could be 
atelectasis/pneumonia

CXR PORTABLE ___
Vascular congestion has improved. Persistent low lung volumes 
with bibasilar opacities larger on the left side. Opacities are 
a combination of effusions and atelectasis. Superimposed 
infection cannot be excluded. There is no 
pneumothorax. Cardiac size cannot be evaluated. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
BRIEF SUMMARY
=============
___ y/o G1P0 with PMH significant for hypothyrodism, now POD2 
from laparotomy and cornual resection of right ectopic 
pregnancy, post-op course complicated by hypoxia and 
intra-abdominal bleeding. 

ACUTE ISSUES
============
# Hypoxic respiratory distress - Felt to be from fluid 
overload/atelectasis. Patient received aggressive volume 
repletion at OSH.  Transfusion related lung injury was also in 
the diagnosis.  She was not felt to have a pneumonia, and CXRs 
showed effusions and atelectasis.  She initially required 
oxygen, but this was weaned off after one dose of lasix.  She 
was discharged with an incentive spirometer and given one 
additional dose of lasix to take at home.  She was advised to 
f/u with her PCP next week for check of lung exam, symptoms, and 
repeat of chemistries.  SHe had a cough but it was not 
productive.  Afebrile, WBC normal. She spent one day in the ICU 
and was transferred to the medical floor.  She felt quite well 
on discharge - without PND, DOE and was ambulating well.  

# Ruptured ectopic pregnancy - seen by GYN in house.   Had 
cornual wedge resection of ruptured pregnancy with large intraop 
blood loss.  Surgical scar healing well, and she was advised to 
f/u with GYN providers as an outpatient. 

# Acute anemia - due to ruptured ectopic pregnancy/intra op 
losses.  Patient with obvious hematoma on lower abdomen 
secondary to intra-op bleeding.  Hct stable in high ___.  

CHRONIC ISSUES
==============
# Hypothyroidism - continued synthroid

2.  Ruptured ectopic pregnancy

Discharge Condition:
Mental Status: Clear and coherent.

Discharge Instructions:
You were transferred from ___ for shortness of breath 
following your surgery for your ectopic pregnancy.  We did not 
find any blood clots as a cause of your shortness of breath.  We 
also do not believe that you have a pneumonia.  Rather, we think 
that your shortness of breath is from extra fluid and 
atelectasis (parts of lung are not ventilated due to not taking 
deep breaths).  I will give you one extra lasix tablet and some 
potassium to take at home.  Please see your PCP next week to get 
your lab work checked and your lungs checked to make sure this 
has improved.  You can continue to take the guiafenisin to help 
with cough.
 
Followup Instructions:
___
