Brief Hospital Course:
The patient presented for scheduled open repair of ventral 
hernia. Please see operation note for full details. After a 
brief, uneventful stay in the PACU, the patient arrived to the 
floor. The patient was hemodynamically stable. Post-operative 
pain was initially well controlled with Dilaudid  PCA, which was 
converted to oral pain medication when tolerating clear liquids. 
On POD1 she was out of bed to the chair, taking clears, O2 
weaned. On POD2, her foley came out and she voided well. Her 
diet was advanced to full liquid diet. On POD3, she had flatus, 
and she was advanced to a regular diet. On POD4, she was given 
miralax to help her move her bowels. She was discharged on POD4.
At the time of discharge, the patient was doing well, afebrile

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,
 
It was a pleasure taking care of you here at ___ 
___. You were admitted to our hospital for 
repair of an incarcerated ventral hernia. You were found to have 
a hernia that was larger than expected, and a second hernia was 
identified and repaired as well. You have recovered from surgery 
in the hospital and are now ready to be discharged to home. 
Please follow the recommendations below to ensure a speedy and 
uneventful recovery. 
 
 
ACTIVITY:
 
- Do not drive until you have stopped taking pain medicine and 
feel you could respond in an emergency.
 
- You may climb stairs. 
 
- You may go outside, but avoid traveling long distances until 
you see your surgeon at your next visit.
 
- You may start some light exercise when you feel comfortable, 
but avoid any activities that involve lifting greater than 6 
pounds or straining. We will discuss additional physical 
activity at your next postoperative visit. You may need 
assistance with activities and chores while at home that involve 
physical labor due to your activity restrictions. 

- You will have visiting nurses to assist with the abdominal 
drain and binder. Please follow their recommendations.
 
HOW YOU MAY FEEL: 
 
- You may feel weak or "washed out" for 6 weeks. You might want 
to nap often. Simple tasks may exhaust you.
 
- You may have a sore throat because of a tube that was in your 
throat.
 
 
YOUR BOWELS:
 
- Constipation is a common side effect of medicine such as 
Percocet or codeine. If needed, you may take a stool softener 
(such as Colace) or gentle laxative (such as Miralax or milk of 
magnesia) twice a day. You can get both of these medicines 
without a prescription.
 
- After some operations, diarrhea can occur. If you get 
diarrhea, don't take anti-diarrhea medicines. Drink plenty of 
fluids and see if it goes away. If it does not go away, or is 
severe and you feel ill, please call your surgeon or come to the 
emergency room immediately.
 
 
PAIN MANAGEMENT:
 
- Your pain should get better day by day. If you find the pain 
is getting worse instead of better, please contact your surgeon.
If you experience any of the following, please contact your 
surgeon:
 
- sharp pain or any severe pain that lasts several hours
- pain that is getting worse over time
- pain accompanied by fever of more than 101
- a drastic change in nature or quality of your pain
 
MEDICATIONS:
- Take all the medicines you were on before the operation just 
as you did before, unless you have been told differently.
- If you have any questions about what medicine to take or not 
to take, please call your surgeon Dr. ___.

Attending: ___
 
Chief Complaint:
Right UPJ obstruction
 
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cystoscopy,right ureteral stent placement, Laparoscopic assisted 
Robotic Right Pyeloplasty

 
History of Present Illness:
___ year old woman who was recently admitted with right 
pyelonephritis in the setting of a chronically obstructed right 
kidney.  Previous CT in ___ had shown mild 
hydroureteronephrosis, and most recent CT showed severe 
hydronephrosis with obstruction at the right ureteropelvic 
junction.  She had a right percutaneous nephrostomy tube placed
emergently for drainage of the right collecting system.  She
defervesed with IV antibiotic therapy.  She still has the right
PCN in place today.  

I had her obtain a MAG-3 Lasix renogram prior to seeing me 
today.
This showed 20% function in her right kidney with the 
nephrostomy
tube in place.  She presents for counseling regarding the next
best step in management of her right kidney.

ROS:
10-point ROS performed and negative unless mentioned above.

IMAGING (reviewed personally by me):
CTU with contrast on ___:
1. Severe hydronephrosis of the right renal collecting system
without a obstructing stone identified. Delayed nephrogram and
excretion of contrast, subtle blood present peripheral
wedge-shaped hypodensities, and perinephric stranding concerning
for pyelonephritis. 2. Large supraumbilical hernia containing a
loop of nonobstructed transverse colon. 3. Scattered diverticula
without evidence of acute diverticulitis. 

Renal scan on ___:
Renal scan demonstrating differential function of 80% on the 
left
and 20% of the right.

Impression:
Ms. ___ is a ___ year old woman with severe right UPJ
obstruction, right PCN in place, and 20% function in her right
kidney.  The cause of her ureteropelvic junction obstruction is
not known, although I did see the possibility of a crossing
vessel at the level of the UPJ which is the most common cause of
this problem in this age group.  

She will require intervention regarding this issue.  The options
are the following: 

1) Chronic stent/PCN changes: this will need to be done every 
___
months for the remainder of her life in order to keep the kidney
drained.  If not done, she is at risk of recurrent infection and
sepsis.

2) Right nephrectomy: Her kidney is providing only 20% function,
and is unlikely to improve even if drained.  Therefore, in order
to prevent repeat infections, laparoscopic nephrectomy is a
reasonable option.

3) Right pyeloplasty: This is repair of the right collecting
system.  It would entail dismembering the right UPJ and putting
it back together in a more favorable conformation, including
reconfiguration around the crossing vessel if needed.  I would
approach this robotically.  The risks of the surgery itself are
slightly higher than nephrectomy, given that it is more complex. 

Success rates are high, >95%.  However, the benefits are
questionable, given the 20% function of her kidney, which again,
I do not believe will improve with time, since the MAG-3 study
was done with the PCN in place (optimal drainage). 

I am favoring either options 2 or 3, as they are more 
definitive.
Either way, I believe she will require surgery.  Given her
diabetes, renal preservation is certainly reasonable.  She would
like to discuss further with her husband and get back to me
regarding her decision.  I will reach out to her next week as
well.

Brief Hospital Course:
Patient was admitted to Urology after undergoing robotic right 
pyeloplasty. No concerning intraoperative events occurred; 
please see dictated operative note for details.
The patient received perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis. The 
patient was transferred to the floor from the PACU in stable 
condition. On POD0, pain was well controlled on PCA, hydrated 
for urine output >30cc/hour, and provided with pneumoboots and 
incentive spirometry for prophylaxis. On POD1, the patient 
ambulated, restarted on home medications, basic metabolic panel 
and complete blood count were checked, pain control was 
transitioned from PCA to oral analgesics, diet was advanced to a 
clears/toast and crackers diet. On POD2, urethral Foley catheter 
was removed without difficulty and diet was advanced as 
tolerated. Her JP was then removed. The remainder of the 
hospital course was relatively unremarkable. The patient was 
discharged in stable condition, eating well, ambulating 
independently, voiding without difficulty, and with pain control 
on oral analgesics. On exam, incision was clean, dry, and 
intact, with no evidence of hematoma collection or infection. 
The patient was given explicit instructions to follow-up in 
clinic in approximately four weeks time.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear ___,
   ___ was a pleasure taking care of you at ___ 
___.  You were admitted for an infection in your 
kidney and an obstruction.  Fortunately, a special tube was 
inserted (called a "nephrostomy") to drain urine and bypass the 
obstruction.  You improved on antibiotics.  You had some minor 
bleeding from the nephrostomy but this was transient and your 
blood counts and vital signs were reassuring.

Our nursing staff gave you instructions on how to care for your 
nephrostomy at home; please make sure to follow these 
instructions.

Please follow-up in ___ clinic as below to have your 
nephrostomy evaluated for possible removal.

Regards,
Your ___ Team
