significant for type 2 diabetes, complicated by peripheral 
neuropathy, chronic kidney disease, and status post right below 
knee amputation in ___, who was admitted to the 
vascular surgery service at ___ on ___ with a left hallux 
ulcer.  

He was treated with IV hydration, and made NPO prior to his 
procedure.  He was taken to the OR on ___ for 
ultrasound-guided access to the right common femoral artery with 
placement of ___ sheath, selective catheterization of SFA 
on the left third order vessel, abdominal aortogram, left lower 
extremity imaging, balloon angioplasty of proximal SFA with a 3 
x 80 mm balloon, stenting of left common iliac artery, with 
Express LD 8 x 27 mm stent, stenting of right common iliac 
extending into the external iliac artery with complete 7 x 60 mm 
stent posted to 6 mm, and closure of access with ___ 
Perclose device.  For full operative details, please see the 
operative report dated ___.  

He tolerated the procedure well, and was transported to the PACU 
for monitoring.  In the PACU, he was hypertensive, and had some 
nausea and vomiting.  An EKG was obtained, and troponins were 
cycled.  His troponins were mildly elevated, but his EKG was not 
concerning for an acute coronary event.  The patient refused his 
second round of troponins initially, and following the second 
round being slightly more elevated, refused another round.  The 
implications of his decision were discussed; however, he 
continued to refuse having any more blood work performed.

Additionally, given concerns for osteomyelitis, an infectious 
disease consult was obtained.  Levoquin was started, with the 
plan to continue it for a total of six weeks. 

He was discharged from the hospital on ___.  At that time, he 
was afebrile, and his vital signs were stable.  He was 
tolerating a regular diet, without any nausea or vomiting. He 
was ambulating without difficulty, and voiding adequate amounts 
of urine.  He was dicharged with instructions to follow-up in 
the vascular surgery clinic in one months time.  He will be
