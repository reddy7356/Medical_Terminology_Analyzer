History of Present Illness:
___ year old Male sent from ___ to the ___ ED 
with severe right ankle pain after taking albuterol for an URI. 
The patient states over the last week prior to admission he 
noted URI symptoms with cough productive of sputum, fever to 
100.3, he wasn't getting better so went to his PCP ___ ___ who 
recommended he take albuterol. He does not like to take 
medications, so declined taking albuterol but said he'd take it 
if there was no improvement. he would try it. He states he felt 
as bad 2 days later, so decided to try it. He reports almost 
immediately after taking he developed excrutiating left leg 
pain. He did not take any more. The pain did not improve over 
the 2 days prior to admission, so presented to the hospital at 
___. He reportedly had imaging there which was non-concerning 
but noted with an elevated CK, so was sent to ___ ED for 
further evaluation.

The patient notes that he had similar pain about ___ years prior 
to admission (in his left leg), and was ultimately sent to ___ 
neurology (Dr ___ for further workup. He was 
diagnosed with RSH (CRPS) and sent to the ___ Pain center and 
was trialed on gabapentin and placed in a boot.

In the ___ ED his initial vitals 97.5, 98, 167/107, 20, 
100%RA. No imaging was performed and he was given 3L of IVF when 
it was noted that his CK was elevated to 4853. He is admitted 
for concern for rhabdomyolysis with albuterol as the causative 
agent.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ is a ___ yo male with a history of NIDM c/b peripheral 
neuropathy, HTN, and remote history of CRPS presenting with 
acute onset of bilateral lower extremity achiness
and tense edema, as well as a new elevated CK.

ACUTE ISSUES:
=============
#Lower Extremity Swelling/Pain
The patient presented with acute onset lower extremity pain 
(R>L) and swelling. Patient's pain is most likely due to 
myositis (see below). Given that the patient has a known history 
of complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) previously treated at 
___ in ___ s/p Gabapentin which resolved spontaneously, we 
considered recurrent CRPS. While he had similar symptoms 
including RLE swelling, erythema, and severe achiness, neurology 
thought recurrent CRPS was unlikely given its acute onset 
without an inciting event and bilateral involvement. Lower 
extremity US at OSH was negative for DVT. There was a low 
suspicion for cellulitis as the patient did not have marked 
erythema and lacked leukocytosis or any infectious symptoms. 
Orthopedics was consulted and had low suspicion for acute 
compartment syndrome given the level of pain and intact 
peripheral pulses. A CHF exacerbation was also unlikely given 
his lack of cardiac history and no other evidence of volume 
overload. Peripheral neuropathy from NIDDM was also deemed less 
likely given different nature of pain on presentation though his 
gabapentin was increased to 600mg TID, standing Tylenol Q6H. He 
only required oxycodone 5mg PRN until ___. His pain slowly 
improved throughout his hospital course and he was able to 
ambulate with ___ on discharge, which he will continue at home 
for ___ more sessions. 

#Myositis
#Elevated CPK
The patient presented with bilateral lower extremity (R>L) 
nonpitting edema, erythema, after a prodromal viral URI. In the 
ED, he was found to have an elevated CRP (15.1), ESR (55), and 
CPK of 4853 (peaked to 9200). MRI of his lower extremities 
demonstrated diffuse intramuscular edema most confluent in right 
anterior tibialis consistent with mild myositis of nonspecific 
etiology. Muscle biopsy was performed on ___ and sent for 
pathology, for which the results are still pending. 

Rheumatology was consulted. The etiology of the patient's 
myositis is still unclear but differential includes inflammatory 
myositis (given pos ___, HLA B27), diabetic myonecrosis (given 
T2DM c/b neuropathy), viral myositis (given recent viral URI), 
drug-induced myositis (given low dose home statin), and 
eosinophilic fasciitis. The lack of proximal muscle weakness 
made inflammatory and statin-induced myositis less likely. Lack 
of peripheral eosinophilia and involvement of fascia per imaging 
made eosinophilic fasciitis unlikely. It was also unlikely to be 
an endocrine myopathy from thyroid disease or ___ 
syndrome, as TSH and AM cortisol levels were normal. We had low 
suspicion for diabetic myonecrosis given patient has controlled 
non-insulin dependent diabetes (A1c 6.6% in ___. 

The most likely diagnosis is a viral myositis given his recent 
URI, though such localized involvement is unusual. Autoimmune 
inflammatory myositis is also on the differential as he is ___ 
positive (1:160) with HLAB27. We held his home statin in the 
setting of a suspected myositis and gave IVF for his elevated 
CPK. The patient did not develop ___ and his CPK level gradually 
decreased to 2246 on ___. Given his resolving symptoms and CPK 
levels, no other therapeutic interventions were made. The 
patient will follow up with outpatient rheumatology. 

CHRONIC ISSUES:
===============
#HTN: Patient was hypertensive throughout hospitalization which 
could have been compounded by his overall pain. His home 
lisinopril was increased to 40 mg PO DAILY with a modest 
improvement in BP (SBP 140s).

#HLD: held Simvastatin 20 mg PO QPM in setting of myositis

#NIDDM: held MetFORMIN (Glucophage) ___ mg PO DAILY. Managed 
with ISS.

#CVD Prevention: Aspirin 81 mg PO DAILY 

#Seasonal Allergies: Patient received loratadine 10 mg PO DAILY 

#Insomnia: Patient received ranitidine 150 mg PO QHS 

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
====================
[] Please follow up with outpatient rheumatology in 1 week (they 
will be calling to schedule an appointment)
[]The patient was hypertensive during this hospitalization. His 
lisinopril was increased. Please consider further addition of 
anti-hypertensives as an outpatient
[]The patient's home statin was held in the setting of myositis. 
Please restart when clinically indicated. 
[]If the patient receives PO steroids, please continue to 
monitor his BG
[]The patient was also started on Gabapentin TID for possible 
neuropathic component of pain
