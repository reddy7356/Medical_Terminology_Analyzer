IMAGING STUDIES
=======================
CT CHEST ___: Complete resolution of the multi-focal
pneumonia described immediate prior study. Short interval 
density
and mild size increase in multiple bilateral peribronchovascular
solid and cavitating nodules as well as appearance of a new
nodule in the left lower lobe. Non-resolving and new nodules
following treatment and the short interval progression raises 
concern for
lung involvement from primary disease. Tissue sampling is
strongly recommended to rule out this possibility. 

CT A/P ___: No acute findings within the abdomen or pelvis. 

Interval improvement in previously demonstrated diffuse colonic
wall thickening with some persistent areas in the descending and
sigmoid colon. Mild thickening of the terminal ileum is overall
unchanged. Questionable asymmetric thickening of the right
lateral bladder wall. Recommend correlation with urinalysis.
Peripheral triangular hyperdensities throughout both kidneys
which may represent retained contrast from prior study on ___
due to renal dysfunction

bacteremia (thought to be ___ GI translocation, treated with IV 
ceftriaxone and daptomycin until ___ and multifocal 
pneumonia with progressive cavitary pulmonary nodules and 
worsening lower extremity edema found to have aspergillosis 
despite adequate levels of posaconazole prophylaxis treated now

bacteremia speciated to VRE bacteremia.
SSESSMENT & PLAN: Mr. ___ is a ___ year old male with history
of relapsed AML treated with multiple rounds chemotherapy and 
MRD
allogeneic HSCT (D0 ___ complicated by steroid-refractory
GI-GVHD, C. difficile colitis, CMV viremia, recent VRE
bacteremia, E.coli bacteremia (thought to be ___ GI
translocation, treated with IV ceftriaxone and daptomycin until
___ and multifocal pneumonia with progressive cavitary
pulmonary nodules and worsening lower extremity edema found to
have aspergillosis despite adequate levels of posaconazole
prophylaxis treated now with isavuconazole. He presents for
direct admission for ___ bacteremia speciated to VRE bacteremia.

ACTIVE ISSUES
========================

#VRE BSI: Unclear source but suspect GI given presenting 
symptoms
(abdominal discomfort, dysuria, and urinary frequency). We
obtained a CT A/P to evaluate for GI pathology and it showed no
acute intra-abdominal process but noted asymmetric thickening of
the right lateral bladder wall as well as stable abnormalities.
UA did not show gross hematuria and pyuria but will obtain BK 
PCR
per urine and serum as well as correlative cytopathology. Of
note, BK urine ___ was markedly elevated (___) so 
may
be potential GI culprit. Pulmonary source is also possible but 
CT
Chest ___ showed resolution of multifocal pneumonia though
noted possible worsening of known cavitary pulmonary nodules.
Prior history of enterococcus faecium bacteremia was resistant 
to
ampicillin, penicillin, and vancomycin. Started on daptomcycin 
(received x1 dose on ___ but per ID
recommendations, we started linezolid ___ mg Q12 hours pending
sensitivity results.  When these became available transitioned 
back to 
dapto given risk of count suppression on linezolid.  There were 
no vegetations on TTE.  
Plan to continue Daptomycin 10 mg/kg IV Q24h for at least 14 day 
course
from date of first negative cultures ___ require 
longer course
given recurrent infection.  
-Appreciate ID recommendations

#RECENT MULTIFOCAL PNEUMONIA AND CAVITARY PULMONARY NODULES:
Patient is currently being treated with isavuconazole given c/f
aspergillus. Recent BAL ___ growing mold (described as a
contaminant but ID concerned about true mold infection). Repeat
chest CT ___ shows complete resolution of multifocal
pneumonia. Chest CT also shows short interval density and mild
size increase in multiple bilateral peribronchovascular solid 
and
cavitating nodules as well as appearance of a new nodule in the
left lower lobe with concern for lung involvement from primary
disease. In close discussion with ID, felt no need to pursue
biopsy and/or change antifungal therapy.  
-Continue isavuconazole 372mg daily
-Appreciate ID recommendations

#AML s/p allogeneic MRD HSCT (Day 0 = ___: 
#THROMBOYCTOPENIA:
AML initially with favorable mutational profile (normal
karyotype; FLT3 negative, NPM1 positive, IDH2 positive, RAD21
positive, CEBPA negative). He relapsed after chemo-consolidation
(7+3, 3C HIDAC & MEC/Revlimid) then underwent an MRD allogeneic
SCT as above. In remission following his transplant with slow
count recovery most likely due to valganciclovir. BMBX during
recent admission showed no evidence of recurrence w/ 100%
chimerism. His immunosuppression agents are:
-Continue Tacrolimus 0.5mg BID; No
adjustments in light of starting Jakafi. 
-Continue ruxolitinib 5mg PO BID
-Continue prednisone 10mg PO QD, tapering while on Jakafi
-Continue Valganciclovir 900mg PO QD; no need for ACV. CMV VL 
neg
could change to ACV. 
-Continue Bactrim SS PO QD
- f/u LENIs (potential source) 

CHRONIC ISSUES
========================

#MASSIVE ANASARCA: Prior LENIs without DVT. Repeat in setting of
infection.  Attributed to multifactorial low albumin due to
GI-GVHD and side effect of steroids. Improved with diuresis and
reduction in prednisone dosing. Significantly improved since 
most
recent admission. 

#GI GVHD: Remains on tacrolimus, prednisone, budesonide and 
Jakafi as above.   
-Continue ID prophylaxis with bactrim
-Continue PPI, vitamin D and folic acid supplementation

#CMV VIREMIA: He continues on valgancyoclovir 900 mg daily until
follow up with ID for full course duration to be determined 
-CMV vL ___ PND. If neg consider changing to ACV. 

#RECURRENT C-Diff COLITIS: Recent completion of oral vancomycin
___ with no further diarrhea. Of note, patient received 
fidaxomicin and dose of bezlotoxumab for prior treatment. 
-Trend for diarrhea recurrence. 

#PRIOR VRE & E.coli BACTEREMIA: He completed a course of
daptomycin and ceftriaxone for E. coli bacteremia, completed on
___. Both bacteremia attributed to a likely GI source
(microperforation or permeability of the bowel mucosa). See 
above
regarding new infection. 

#NICOTINE DEPENDENCE: nicotine patch while inpatient.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ is a ___ male with no significant past 
medical
history who was referred from an outside hospital with new acute 
myelogenous leukemia in the setting of subacute fevers, 
shortness of breath, and peritonsillar phlegmon. He received 
induction chemotherapy with 7+3. His course was complicated by 
acute diverticulitis and fever of unknown origin. He was 
ultimately deemed stable for discharge.

ACTIVE ISSUES
============
#Acute myelogenous leukemia: The patient was transferred from 
___ in the setting of several months of 
intermittent fevers, decreased exercise tolerance, and new 
peritonsillar phlegmons. A CBC at the OSH showed a white blood 
cell count of 67,000 and 30% myeloid blasts on smear. He was 
transferred to ___ for further workup. A bone marrow biopsy on 
admission at ___ was consistent with AML, normal karyotype, 
FLT3(-), IDH2(+), NPM1(+), RAD21(+), CEBPA (-). The patient was 
initially started on Hydrea, steroids, and fluids before 
beginning 7+3 on ___. He tolerated chemotherapy well with 
only mild nausea, grade 2 mucositis, a petechial rash on the 
bilateral thighs, and increased fatigue. Bone marrow biopsy on 
day 14 of his chemotherapy cycle showed chemoablation. He 
otherwise remained stable. Pt was discharged after his D28 bone 
marrow biopsy, results pending on DC. 

#Peritonsillar phlegmon/abscess
#Acute diverticulitis
#Neutropenic fever: The patient initially presented with 
subacute fevers. These were likely due to a combination of his 
AML and peritonsillar phlegmons. He was initially started on 
Zosyn with subsequent decrease in tonsil size and exudate. 
However, on ___, the patient became febrile to 100.9. He was 
subsequently switched to cefepime and Flagyl. The patient 
continued to be febrile, Vancomycin was added on ___. 
Throughout these febrile episodes, the patient otherwise 
remained HDS, +diarrhea, C. diff negative. CT Chest/A/P on 
___ showed findings consistent with acute sigmoid 
diverticulitis and stable peritonsillar phlegmons. Pt continued 
to be intermittently febrile between ___ and ___, Vanc was DC'd 
on ___, switched from cefepime to meropenem on ___ due to 
concern for drug fever. Pt ultimately defervesced on ___. 
Blood and urine cultures remained negative throughout the 
entirety of the patient's febrile episodes. It was thought that 
the last week of fevers may have been drug-related (vancomycin 
vs. cefepime).

___. 
      POSITIVE.              (Reference Range-Negative). 
         The C. difficile PCR is highly sensitive for toxigenic 
strains of
         C. difficile and detects both C. difficile infection 
(CDI) and
         asymptomatic carriage. Therefore, positive C. diff PCR 
tests

highly
         specific for CDI.

      POSITIVE.              (Reference Range-Negative).  
PERFORMED BY EIA. 
         This result indicates a high likelihood of C. difficile

with intermediate-risk cytogenetics and favorable risk (normal 
karyotype, FLT3-, NPM1+, IDH2+, RAD21+, CEBPA-) in ___ remission 
after successful induction 7+3 now s/p C2D16 of HiDAC 
consolidation therapy, admitted for neutropenic fever in setting 
of pRBC and platelet transfusion in clinic.  

# NEUTROPENIC FEVER: 
Admitted for neutropenic fever to 101.1 that occurred during 
pRBC and platelet transfusion in clinic despite having received 
acetaminophen, diphenhydramine, and Pepcid. Started on broad 
spectrum antibiotics with cefepime. Was otherwise feeling 
completely well without localizing signs/symptoms of infection. 
Negative blood and urine cultures, CXR clear, port site without 
erythema or purulence, history of gluteal abscess however this 
has resolved. Workup of transfusion reaction notable for 
normal/negative LDH, haptoglobin, direct Coombs test, and HLA 
antibody screen. Most likely represented febrile non-hemolytic 
reaction. Neutrophil counts recovered on D17 of HiDAC. Received 
additional 1u platelets prior to discharge without reaction.

# ACUTE MYELOLOID LEUKEMIA:
# PANCYTOPENIA
Notable for intermediate-risk cytogenetics and favorable risk 
(normal karyotype, FLT3-, NPM1+, IDH2+, RAD21+, CEBPA-) in ___

==============
#GVHD of GI tract
Patient had biopsy proven GVHD of his esophagus, stomach and 
distal colon and was treated with high dose steroids at 2mg/kg, 
tacrolimus and budesonide. Throughout his admission, his CMV 
viral load and EBV viral load turned positive and he was treated 
with Valganciclovir and Rituximab. His C dif PCR and stool 
cultures were negative. He was also started on a PPI and Vitamin 
D supplementation, and required TPN while NPO. His diarrhea 
eventually began to improve, his diet was slowly advanced and 
his steroids were weaned down. His current medications include 
prednisone 50 mg QD, tacrolimus 0.5 BID, and budesonide 3 mg 
TID.

# Elevated AST/ALT/T. bili: patient's AST/ALT/direct bili were 
elevated at times during this admission. This was likely 
multifactorial, due to medication effect with posaconazole 
therapy, his TPN, possible extraintestinal GVHD, CMV infection. 
After holding the lipids in his TPN, his transaminitis improved. 
He had a RUQ US on ___ without acute cholecystitis.

# Acute myeloid leukemia:  in complete remission. Initially with 
favorable mutational profile (normal karyotype; FLT3 negative, 
NPM1 positive, IDH2 positive, RAD21 positive, CEBPA negative). 
Relapsed AML now in remission s/p allo-SCT (___) on vaccine 
protocol ___ (decision for vaccine per Dr. ___. 
Patient was initially continued on his prophylactic bactrim, 
acyclovir (transitioned to valganciclovir after CMV +) and was 
started on antifungal prophylaxis after receiving high dose 
steroids for GVHD. Of note, he became thrombocytopenic during 
his stay (possibly related to his Bactrim and valganciclovir 
therapy), and Bactrim was switched to Atovaquone on ___.

#CMV viremia
On ___, patient had positive CMV of 2.1, with repeat of 2.2 on
___. He was started on PO valganciclovir 900mg bid on ___. CMV 
VL was monitored weekly and became undetectable on ___. After 2 
negative VLs, he was decreased to 900mg valganciclovir qd on 
___.

#EBV viremia
Patient had elevated EBV on ___. Repeat on ___ still
elevated at 1589 with ___ repeat significantly higher at 5147.
Back down to 1483 on ___. 
- ___ PET scan without any suspicious LAD
- s/p Rituximab on ___. Recheck on ___ was pending at time of 
discharge.

#R foot cellulitis
Patient with erythema of R medial ankle on ___ that rapidly 
extended into his foot and up his lower leg, concerning for 
rapidly evolving infection in the setting of immunosuppression. 
CT ___ without subcutaneous gas, drainable fluid collection or 
bony involvement and US lower extremity ___ without evidence 
clot. Started on Vancomycin, Cefepime and Clindamycin, ID was 
consulted. ___ blood culture showed Pseudomonas putida, 
sensitive to Cefepime. Per ID, cellulitis is likely 
monomicrobial infection due to pseudomonas. Vancomycin and 
Flagyl were discontinued and he remained on Cefepime from ___ - 
___. He was transitioned to ciprofloxacin 500mg BID and 
discharged to finish a ___nding on ___. His last 
positive blood culture was on ___.

# History of genital lesion: not present on admission. Had 
resolved after cryotherapy, most consistent with genital warts. 

#Thrush - patient was found to have thrush of his oral mucosa on 
___ and was treated with clotrimazole troches
