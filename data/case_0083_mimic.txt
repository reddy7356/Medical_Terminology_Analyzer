not done previously; see recommendation below.

age ___ or 1.5 
cm in patients age ___ or ___, or with suspicious findings.

Brief Hospital Course:
HOSPITAL COURSE
--------------------
___ woman with hx dementia presented to the ED after a 
mechanical fall, treated for a Klebsiella UTI with 3 days of 
ceftriaxone, found to have an impacted and mildly medially 
displaced right femoral neck fracture s/p R hemiarthoplasty 
___, with course complicated by intermittent hypoxia likely in 
setting of atelectasis/mucous plugging.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES
--------------------
[ ] Monitor Hg in 1 week ___ (had downtrending Hg in setting of 
hemodilution and arthroplasty, required one unit of pRBCs, 
discharge Hg 10.0 on ___
[ ] Started on lovenox for prophylaxis in setting of 
arthroplasty, discontinue in month ___, monitor for any 
signs of bleeding 
[ ] follow up with orthopedics on ___ 
[ ] Has R lobe thyroid nodule seen on CT, ultrasound follow-up 
recommended if within ___
[ ] WOUND CARE: 
 - You may shower. No baths or swimming for at least 4 weeks. 
 - Any stitches or staples that need to be removed will be taken 
out at your 2-week follow up appointment. 
 - Incision may be left open to air unless actively draining. If 
draining, you may apply a gauze dressing secured with paper 
tape. 

ACTIVE ISSUES: 
# Right femoral neck fracture s/p R hemiarthroplasty ___
Patient found to have right femoral head fracture ___ fall at 
nursing facility. s/p R hemiarthroplasty ___ w/o complications. 
Her pain was managed with scheduled tylenol. She was started on 
lovenox 40qHS for DVT prophylaxis for one month. End date 
___.

# Intermittent hypoxia
Pt with 2 episodes of hypoxia to the ___, with swift recovery to 
room air. First episode occurred in the immediate post-op 
period, at which point a CXR was repeated that did not show 
worsening pulmonary congestion or PNA. Second episode occurred 
overnight and resolved without specific intervention. These 
episodes were determined to likely be ___ mucus plugging vs mild 
chronic aspiration vs atelectasis. There was low concern for 
pulmonary edema given CXRs and euvolemia on exam. At the time of 
discharge, the patient was back on Room Air for > 48 hours.

# Anemia
Came in with Hg 12.4 and downtrended over the first several days 
of her hospitalization, with nadir at 7.6. This likely occurred 
in the setting of hemodilution, followed by bleeding from her 
arthroplasty. She had a normal abdominal/pelvis CT, ordered 
given concern for possible intraabdominal/retroperitoneal 
bleeding from her fall and her inability to express pain due to 
dementia. She received one unit of pRBCs per ortho protocol to 
transfuse for Hg<8 in elderly. Hg responded appropriately, 
discharge Hg 10. 

# Fall
# AMS at dementia baseline, resolved
Per ED collateral, baseline mental status worsened as she was 
non verbal and had bouts of aggressiveness. This was attributed 
to her UTI, treated as below. A non-con CT head was performed in 
the ED and was unremarkable. Her mental status returned to her 
normal baseline during hospitalization. 

# Klebsiella UTI
# leukocytosis, resolved
# lactic acidosis, resolved
Pt has a leukocytosis to 14 on admission and slightly elevated 
lactate with tachycardia, all of which resolved with IV fluids 
and abx therapy. urine culture grew Klebsiella and she was 
treated with IV ceftriaxone for 3 days. Discharge wbc 8.6. 

# CKD 3
Per review ___ labs, pt with baseline Cr 0.9-1.1. She is at 
her baseline. She was discharged with a Cr 0.8.

# Thyroid nodule, right lobe
Visualized on CT Spine with normal TSH. Ultrasound follow-up 
recommended if within ___

CHRONIC ISSUES: 
# Dementia - alzheimers per hx, continued home memantine 10mg 
BID and performed delirium precautions

# Oropharyngeal phase dysphagia - on soft diet per instructions 
from nursing home. on aspiration precautions

# Glaucoma - continued home eye drops per formulary

#CODE STATUS: Confirm DNR/DNI?
