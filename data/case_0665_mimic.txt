___ ___
1.  Right frontotemporal hemorrhagic contusions.   
2.  Tiny subdural hematoma in the right middle cranial fossa.   
3.  Left temporal bone fracture with blood in the middle ear 
cavity and tiny foci of pneumocephalus.  The fracture line 
extends into the sphenoid sinus, along the petrous portion of 
the ICA.  CTA would be recommended to exclude carotid injury. 

___ CT c-spine
No acute fracture of the cervical spine.

___ CTA Head
No significant changes are demonstrated in the fracture 
involving 
the left internal carotid canal, no new lesions are identified.  
The CTA of the head demonstrates normal pattern of vascular 
enhancement throughout the internal carotid arteries and 
vertebrobasilar system, there is no evidence of flow stenotic 
lesions, dissection or aneurysm larger than 3 mm in size. 

___ pelvis AP/Lat
Single AP view of the pelvis was provided.  Overlying bed linens 

are present which limit the evaluation given the overlapping 
linear densities. The bony pelvic ring appears intact.  No 
definite fracture at either hip.  Mild right acetabular spurring 
is noted. 

___ ___
1.  Stable right frontotemporal hemorrhagic contusions and small 
subdural 
hematoma in the right middle cranial fossa.   
2.  Unchanged appearance of left temporal bone fracture. 
3.  Opacification of scattered ethmoid air cells and nearly 
total 
opacification of the left sphenoidal sinus suggest chronic sinus 
inflammatory 
disease.

On ___, the patient was admitted from the emergency room where 
he was loaded with 1 gram of Keppra and started on iv thiamine 
and folate. He underwent a CTA of the head to rule out vascular 
injury secondary to his temporal bone fracture which was
