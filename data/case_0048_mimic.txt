evaluation of weakness and unsteady gait.  
.  
She was in her usual state of health at her assisted living 
until two days ago when she had an unwitnessed fall. Per report, 
there was no head trauma, but it was unclear whether the fall 
was mechanical or of another etiology, and she does not recall 
it. During this period, she has also had increasing weakness. 
She normally is able to walk with her walker but was unable to 
do so on the day of presentation and had been confined to a 
wheelchair. She was seen by her PCP who noted ___ BP of 90/50 and 
concentrated urine, and she was sent to the ED. She denied 
fevers, chills, chest pain, and dyspnea. Of note, she was

weakness, with difficulty sitting up in bed. EKG was nsr with no 
acute changes, and a head CT was negative. She was given her 
home medications, metoprolol and metformin, and also given 1L NS

compatible with mild atelectasis, however, an early developing 
pneumonia can be considered in the appropriate clinical setting. 


CT-Head: There is no evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage, 
edema, mass, mass effect or large vascular territorial 
infarction. The ventricles and sulci are enlarged, compatible 
with diffuse cortical atrophy, unchanged since the ___ study. A focal area of encephalomalacia is redemonstrated 
within the right cerebellar hemisphere. Periventricular white 
matter hypodensities are compatible with microvascular ischemic 
disease. A hypodense focus within the right basal ganglia is 
chronic. Included views of the paranasal sinuses and mastoid air

Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. ___ presented on ___ with a two day history of 
weakness in the setting of moderate dementia, type two diabetes, 
CAD (s/p 4v CABG in ___, and multiple recent mechanical falls. 


## Weakness: The patient lives in assisted living and was 
reported to be able walk with a walker at baseline but had 
become progressively unstable on her feet with difficulty 
getting in and out of a sitting position over the two days prior 
to admission. Over this time she also noted poor PO intake. In 
the ED, initial vs were: 97.8 65 119/48 16 98ra. Her exam was 
notable for poor memory, decreased left-sided strength (stable 
from distant CVA), no pain anywhere, clear lungs, and weakness 
with difficulty sitting up in bed. EKG was nsr with no acute 
changes, and a head CT was negative. UA was benign and labs were 
notable for acute renal insufficiency. She was given 1L NS IVF 
with prompt resolution of her renal insufficiency, suggesting 
dehydration in the setting of poor PO intake as the likely 
etiology. Following IVF hydration the patient reported feeling 
significantly improved. ___ evaluated the patient and felt she 
was significantly deconditioned and would benefit from ___ 
rehabilitation to improve endurance, stability, and transfer 
from chair to standing. 
.
## Dementia: The patient has moderate dementia (age related vs. 
Alzheimer's) with preservation of distant memory. She has been 
uptitrating on Namenda (5mg po daily for 7 days then 5BID for 7 
days then 15mg po daily split into 10 and 5mg dosing for 6 days) 
prior to admission. This was held for two days as an inpatient 
out of concern that it may have contributed to a sense of 
dizziness/weakness. On ___ the patient was restarted on her 
Namenda, 15mg po daily .  She will complete her uptitration by 
starting 10mg PO daily on ___.
.
## Type two diabetes: The patient was treated with HISS as an 
inpatient and oral hyperglycemics were held as an inpatient with 
adequate glucose control. On ___ she was resumed on her home 
oral hyperglyceic regimen prior to discharge.

Discharge Instructions:
Mrs. ___, it was a pleasure caring for you at the ___ 
___. You were admitted for weakness 
that had developed over the course of two days following a 
recent fall. In the Emergency Room your vital signs were stable 
and you did not have a fever. A CT scan of your head did not 
show any bleeding or fractures. A chest x-ray showed no clear 
sign of pneumonia or infection. Urine analysis showed no sign of 
urinary tract infection. Lab tests on your blood suggested you 
were moderately dehydrated and this seemed to be affecting your 
kidney function. You were treated with IV fluids and your lab 
values returned to normal ranges while you appeared to 
clinically feel better. The physical therapists saw you and felt 
you were too weak to return to your home at ___. You 
were therefore discharged to a rehabilitation facility.

Medication Changes*:

Increased Amlodipine 10 mg by mouth daily

* Note that we stopped Namenda for 2 days given concern that

Brief Hospital Course:
Fall:  Ms. ___ was admitted after a fall.  She complained 
of pain at her right hip initially, but hip films were negative. 
 With tylenol alone, her pain completely resolved during her 
hospital stay.  She was evaluated by physical therapy, who 
recommended STR for both ___ and OT in order for her to recover 
her strength and reach her baseline so that she can return home 
to assisted living.  

UTI:  She was diagnosed with a pan-sensitive E Coli UTI during 
her stay,and was initially treated with ceftriaxone, which was 
converted to cefpodoxime.  Daughter is interested in patient 
being on some kind of prophylaxis for recurrent UTIs, so she 
___ d/w PCP and set up outpatient urology appt.

DM:  Her home dose of glyburide was reduced from 10 mg po bid to 
5 mg po bid because of some low sugars in the hospital.  In 
addition, her home dose of metformin 1000 mg po bid was 
continued.  If her blood sugars are elevated at rehab, please 
resume her home dose of 10 mg bid of glyburide. 

She received DVT prophylaxis with heparin during her stay.  As 
she will be more ambulatory during her rehab stay, this was 
discontinued.  

Her admission CXR showed some ? of confluence of shadows at the 
right base.  I discussed this finding with the daughter, and 
with PCP.  IF there remains concern about this finding, the CXR 
can be repeated as an outpatient.

Brief Hospital Course:
As mentioned in the HPI, Mrs. ___ was admitted from the 
emergency room after she was found to have a non-ST segment 
elevation myocardial infarction. She was appropriately medically 
managed and worked up for cardiac surgery. On ___ she was 
brought to the operating room where she underwent a coronary 
artery bypass graft x 4. The procedure was performed by Dr. 
___.  Please see operative report for surgical 
details. In summary she had CABG x4 with LIMA-LAD, SVG-Diag, 
SVG-Ramus, SVG-OM. She tolerated the operation well and 
following surgery she was transferred to the CVICU for invasive 
monitoring in stable condition. She remained intubated for three 
days after surgery secondary to a difficult airway and fluid 
overload.  She was weaned from her pressors and her chest tubes 
were removed.  She was fed via a dobhoff tube after surgery 
secondary to somnolence.  She was noted to be confused after the 
surgery, but also has a baseline history of dementia.  Her beta 
blockade was titrated up as tolerated.  On post-operative day 
seven she was transferred to the surgical step down floor.  She 
had intermitant episodes of atrial fibrillation with hypotension 
and was returned to the surgical intensive care unit, where she 
converted to sinus rhythm after adjustment of Bblockers and 
initiation of amiodarone.  Her mediastinal incision was noted to 
have some purulent drainage and she was started on Vancomycin 
and ciprofloxacin.  She was transferred back to the step down 
floor on post-operative day nine. Sternal drainage subsided and 
her sternum remained stable. As discussed with ___ 
was discontinued and upon discharge, Vancomycin will be 
continued for 7 days. She was seen by phyisical therapy. On  
post-operative day 15 she was discharged to rehabilitation at 
___.
