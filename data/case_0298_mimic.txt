presented to ___ ___ with acute severe abd pain, 
nausea/emesis. Pt reported pain present for 3 days. Also with 
fever and generalized weakness. He has had similar attacks in

Pertinent Results:
ERCP ___:

The scout film was normal. 
The major papilla was normal. 
The pancreatic duct was partially filled with contrast and 
visualized proximally. The pancreatic duct was mildly dilated.
The bile duct was deeply cannulated with the sphincterotome. 
Contrast was injected and there was brisk flow through the 
ducts. Contrast extended to the entire biliary tree. 
The CBD was mildly dilated and ectatic with a maximal diameter 
of 12 mm in diameter. 
There were no filling defects identified in the CBD or CHD. 
Opacification of the gallbladder was incomplete. 
The left and right hepatic ducts and all intrahepatic branches 
were all mildly dilated.

A sphincterotomy was performed with a sphincterotome. There was 
no post sphincterotomy bleeding. 
The biliary tree was swept with a 8.5-11.5mm balloon starting at 
the bifurcation. 
Cytology samples were obtained for histology from the ampullary 
region using a brush. 
Cold forceps biopsies were then taken from the ampulla for 
histology. 
Excellent bile and contrast drainage was seen endoscopically and 
fluoroscopically.

All of the above findings are in keeping with ampullary 
stenosis. 

CT abdomen/pelvis (prelim report):
No evidence of perforation or pancreatitis. Mild dilatation of 
the intra and extrahepatic bile ducts as well as the pancreatic 
duct without obstructing stone or mass identified. 
  
Multiple one centimeter or smaller hypervascular lesions are 
seen in the right hepatic lobe. While these are favored to be 
benign in etiology, given patient demographics, multiplicity, 
and presence of duct dilatation further characterization with 
MRI is recommended

___ RESULTS (prior to

abnormality

CT Abd/Pelvis ___ Conculsion: Mild diffuse intrahepatic 
biliary dilation and mild diffuse pancreatic ductal dilation. 
Normal caliber CBD. While nonspecific, obstruction at the level 
of the ampulla should be excluded.

MRCP ___ Conculsion: Nonspecific intra and extrahepatic 
biliary dilation. Ampullary lesion cannot be excluded.

w/sphincerotomy.  Pathology pending, will follow up results and 
communicate to PCP and patient.  Advanced diet without 
difficulty day after procedure, with benign abdominal exam at 
discharge.

Primary diagnosis:
ampullary stenosis

Secondary diagnosis:
chronic pain
left peroneal nerve palsy

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted for observation following ERCP.  The ERCP 
showed that the end of the bile duct was narrowed, which may be 
a cause of your symptoms.  You underwent a sphincterotomy to 
help address this narrowing.  You had some pain after the 
procedure, and a CT scan did not show any complications.

Please see below for your follow up appointments and 
medications.  
 
Followup Instructions:
