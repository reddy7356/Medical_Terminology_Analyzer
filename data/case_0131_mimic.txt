IMAGING
RUQ U/S ___
1.  Normal appearance of the transplanted liver. No intrahepatic 
biliary duct dilation or evidence of hepatic artery stenosis.  
Patent hepatic vasculature. 
2. Unchanged postoperative fluid collection, likely a seroma or 
hematoma, as described above. 

___ Liver Bx
Liver, allograft, needle core biopsy:
1) Focal mild portal inflammatory infiltrate comprised 
predominantly of lymphocytes with scattered
eosinophils and rare plasma cells with lymphocytic cholangitis 
and a focus suspicious for portal
endothelialitis (level 1A3).
2) Minimal steatosis present with focal balloon degeneration.
3) Trichrome stain shows no increase in fibrosis.
4) Iron stains shows mild iron deposition within Kupffer cells.

ERCP ___
The scout film revealed previous stent in place. 
After stent removal, the bile duct was deeply cannulated with 
the balloon. 
Contrast was injected and there was brisk flow through the 
ducts. Contrast extended to the entire biliary tree. 
The native CBD was 11-12 mm in diameter. 
There were no filling defects. 
The transplanted biliary duct was 4 mm, suggestive of duct 
mismatch. 
The stricture had resolved. 
The left and right hepatic ducts and all intrahepatic branches 
were normal. 
An 8 mm balloon was swept along the main duct without 
difficulty. 
No stone or sludge was removed. 
Excellent bile and contrast drainage was seen endoscopically and 
fluoroscopically. 
Overall, successful ERCP with stent pull and cholangiogram 
showing resoluation of the stricture that is likely secondary to 
duct mismatch.

Cyclspr-___ y/o male initially admitted to the medical service with 
weakness, and notes increasing ascites. Creatinine was also 
noted to be 1.9.
.
Renal ultrasound was performed showing normal native kidneys. 
Duplex done on liver showed patent vasculature, and also that he 
had massive ascites.
A paracentesis was due to be performed, but on HD 4, the patient 
was offered a donor liver, and he was taken to the OR.

Patient was taken to the OR with Dr ___ and Dr ___ 
___. At the time of surgery 6.5 liters of clear ascites was 
taken off. The hepatectomy was without major complication. The 
implanted liver reperfused normally. 
At the time of transplant he received 5 units RBCs, 4 units FFP, 
one unit of platelets, and had an estimated one liter blood 
loss.
He was stable at the end of the case and transferred to SICU, 
still intubated.

At the time of surgery he received a gram of mycophenolate pre 
op, and this was continued at one gram BID. He received 500 mg 
Solu-Medrol intra-op. Standard IV steroid taper was followed, 
however on POD 11, the PO prednisone was dropped to 10 mg daily 
due to concern for mental status changes. He started on Tacro on 
the evening of POD 0, and this was continued monitoring daily 
levels and adjusting dose accordingly.
However, worsening mental status on POD 7 was impetus to 
discontinue the tacro and switch him to cyclosporine starting 
the following day.

Following the transplant surgery, the patient was extubated on 
POD 1. He was restarted on tube feeds, given a clear diet, JP 
drains were sero-sanguinous. He did receive 2 units of RBCs, 1 
FFP, 1 platelet and 2 cryo.
Protocol ultrasound showed Patent hepatic vasculature with 
appropriate waveforms.

Patient was transferred to the regular surgical floor on POD 2. 
He continued to tolerate tube feeds. Had + flatus. Foley 
catheter was d/c'd and he voided without difficulty.
Patient was seen by ___ for new onset hyperglycemia, 
ultimately was sent out on an insulin sliding scale with an 
insulin pen.

Medial JP was removed on POD 4
He was seen and evaluated by ___, they recommended home with ___.

Creatinine was noted to still be elevated following liver 
transplant. Over the course of the hospitalization, the 
creatinine eventually came back down to 1.0  He was voiding 
adequate urine.

Once his bowel started functioning again, he actually started to 
have significant diarrhea, up to 6 bowel movements daily and 
very loose. Stool for C diff was negative. After nutrition 
review, his formula was changed to Pulmocare, and this has been 
more well tolerated, with ___ but more formed bowel movements 
daily. We also changed him from MMF to Myfortic.

Patient was being setup for discharge, but on about POD 7, he 
was seeming more confused. At night was when it was worse, and 
where it was first noted, and then it was occurring during the 
day. It was decided to stop the tacro, wait a day and then start 
cyclosporine.
It took a few days, but mental status started to clear, and the 
patient was deemed safe to go home on POD 12.

Brief Hospital Course:
___ with decompensated HCV  cirrhosis (ascites, coagulopathy) on 
transplant list with MELD of 23 presenting with worsening volume 
overload, malnutrition and ___ with creatinine of 2.0. 
  
#HCV cirrhosis: 
Decompensated by coagulopathy and ascites on admission. 
Bilirubin level was stable and no signs of HE although on 
rifaximin (was not taking lactulose at home). He is currently 
being treated with sofosbuvir/ribavirin and had cleared his 
viral load after 1 month of treatment. Ribavirin and sofosbuvir 
were initially discontinued due to ___ but restarted with renal 
improvement. Ribavirin was started at a lower dose due to 
chronic anemia caused by the drug and Sofosbuvir was restarted 
at the home dose.

___: 
Patient with baseline creatinine of 0.9, was increased to 2.0 on 
___ in setting of increasing doses of diuretics. After 
paracentesis of tense ascites and holding diuretics, his Cr 
improve to his baseline, suggestive of either vascular depletion 
from diuretics or tense ascites causing renal vascular 
compression or simple volume overload.

# Nutrition: 
Patient's cirrhosis and ascites had been causing decreased 
appetitite due to gastric compression as well as a catabolic 
state leading to muscle wasting. Nutrition was consulted and 
calorie counts were initiated. A Dobhoff tube was placed at the 
bedside and supplemental tube feedings were initiated. The 
patient was tolerating tube feeds well during the day prior to 
discharge. He had mild hypophosphatemia in the setting of tube 
feeds which was repleted prior to discharge.

# Ascites: 
Patient with history of significant ascites, worsening over last 
few weeks despite increased diuretics and becoming tense 
ascites. He had 4L removed in the ED on admit with resolution of 
the tensity, and a second therapeutic paracentesis for 5L was 
performed prior to discharge.

# Varices: 
He had EGD performed during this admission with Grade 2 varices 
visualized. He was started on nadolol for treatment of 
esophageal varices.

# Anemia: 
He has baseline Hgb of 11 due to Ribavirin induced anemia. 
Initial drop of 11 to 7.5 in Hgb thought to be dilutional in the 
setting of immediate prior albumin administration. No signs or 
symptoms of bleeding were appreciated and his counts began to 
return to his baseline. He was given 1u PRBCs given his severe 
liver disease and significant anemia. 

Transitional Issues:
-Please repeat creatinine and sodium on ___ and fax result to 
___ to ensure stable creatinine and sodium on diuretics
-Please repeat chemistries on ___ to ensure no refeeding 
syndrome
-Please follow-up peritoneal fluid culture from ___

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,

You were admitted with worsening kindey function and poor PO 
intake. You had a paracentesis with 4L removed and your kidney 
function improved. You had an EGD which did show varices and a 
feeding tube was placed to help you improve your nutrition at 
home. You have been set up with a home infusion company who will 
assist with tube feeding at home.

It is very important that you continue to take all of your 
medications as prescribed. We have decreased your diuretic doses 
to help protect your kidneys and started nadolol to prevent 
bleeding from varices.

It was a pleasure taking care of you!

PATHOLOGY:
==========
Liver, allograft,needle core biopsies:
1) Acute cellular rejection with mild portal inflammatory 
infiltrate comprised predominantly of
lymphocytes with prominent eosinophils and rare plasma cells 
with portal endothelialitis and
lymphocytic cholangitis.
2) No significant steatosis is seen.
3) Immunostain for CMV is negative with adequate control.
4) Trichrome stain shows mild partial expansion.
5) Iron stain shows no stainable iron.
Note: The findings are consistent with mild acute cellular 
rejection. It is difficult to evaluate for
recurrent HCV in this setting.

IMAGING:
========
___/ RUQ ULTRASOUND:
IMPRESSION:  
1.  Normal ultrasound of the transplant liver. 
2. Stable subcutaneous postoperative seroma/ hematoma as 
described above. 

___ CXR
FINDINGS:  
The lungs are clear without focal consolidation.  No pleural 
effusion or 
pneumothorax is seen. The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes 
are 
unremarkable. 
IMPRESSION:    
No acute cardiopulmonary process. 

___ RP ULTRASOUND:
FINDINGS:  
Again seen is a 3.8 x 2.5 x 0.9 cm subcutaneous fluid collection 
anterior to the liver, consistent with hematoma, unchanged in 
size compared to the most recent liver ultrasound, earlier 
today. Limited views of the liver demonstrate no acute 
abnormality. 
  
IMPRESSION:  
Unchanged subcutaneous fluid collection anterior to the liver, 
likely 
consistent with hematoma/seroma.

Brief Hospital Course:
This is a ___ male with a PMHx of HCV/EtOH cirrhosis s/p 
 OLT in ___ with HCV cure but c/b biliary stricutre s/p 
stenting presenting after liver biopsy for transaminitis with 
fevers and leukopenia consistent with sepsis found to have mild 
acute liver rejection

# Sepsis: Presented with fevers and leukopenia with a 10% 
bandemia which developed hours after liver biopsy on ___. 
Given the timing, the most likely source of infection was 
thought to be transient bacteremia after liver biopsy. Blood and 
urine cultures were sent and he was started on vancomycin/zosyn. 
Vancomycin was discontinued after 48 hours and he completed a 
5-day course of zosyn without recurrent febrile episode. 

# HCV/EtOH Cirrhosis s/p OLT with Mild Acute Rejection: Patient 
presented with AST/ALT that were elevated compared to most 
recent values from ___, as well as mild 
hyperbilirubinemia. Liver biopsy was done as an outpatient on 
___ for these rising LFTs. Results returned with evidence of 
mild acute rejection. HCV and CMV viral loads were undetectable. 
 Blood levels of both cyclosporine and everolimus were sub 
therapeutic, however. This was thought to be due to a complex 
drug-drug interaction. Cyclosporine was increased to 150mg BID 
and everolimus was increased to 3mg BID, without effect. Due to 
this drug interaction, the patient was started on tacrolimus, 
and cyclosporine was discutoninued. Levels were monitored and on 
discharge his tacrolimus dose was 5mg Q12 and his everolimus 
dose was 4mg BID. His most recent levels were 5.3 and 3.4 
respectively.  For acute rejection, he was treated with 5 days 
of 500mg solumedrol starting on ___. LFTs decreased by over 
50% on this regimen. He was transitioned to 20mg prednisone 
daily and planned for a taper over the course of several weeks.

# Post-transplant CKD: Baseline Cr is 1.4-1.7, and was 1.3 at 
discharge.

# Moderate malnutrition: Nutrition was consulted, who 
recommended ensure plus TID with meals.

# Possible hepatic arterial stenosis: Patent portal vasculature 
was seen on RUQ U/S. Continued on aspirin.

# Hypertension: amlodipine and metoprolol were held in setting 
of possible sepsis initially. After receiving steroids, the 
patient developed hypertension, so home amlodipine was restarted 
and increased to 10mg daily. Metoprolol was discontinued his 
blood pressures were within normal levels with only amlodipine.

# Headaches: Felt to be possibly related to immunosuppression 
side effect given the patient's temporal association. He was 
treated with Acetaminophen as needed, and this had resolved at 
discharge.

# Depression: Continued on sertraline.

# GERD: Continued on omeprazol.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
- patient will need to be on Valcyte for at least 3 months 
starting from ___
- patient will need to be on Bactrim for at least ___ year 
starting from ___
- Prednisone taper: 20mg for one week, then decrease by 5mg 
every week thereafter.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,

It was a pleasure taking care of you during your recent 
hospitalization at ___. You were hospitalized after having 
fevers and chills after a liver biopsy. We treated you with IV 
antibiotics but did not find a source of infection. We believe 
your fevers may have been to a transient bloodstream infection 
after the biopsy. Your liver biopsy showed that you were 
suffering from some mild rejection of your new liver. This is 
probably because everolimus and cyclosporine, the two 
immunosuppressant drugs you were taking, were not at adequate 
levels. To treat your rejection, we gave you high doses of 
steroids. Your liver function tests improved, and you were 
switched to oral steroids. You should take this taper as 
prescribed.

We also switched your immunosuppressants. You are now taking 
everolimus and tacrolimus. These two medications still have 
complex interactions, but it is our hope that they will prevent 
any further rejection of your new liver.

Please take your medications as prescribed and follow-up with 
your doctors as below. Please also eat a low carbohydrate diet 
while you are on steroids.

We wish the best!
-Your ___ Team

IMAGING/PATH:
==========================
___  Liver, allograft, needle core biopsy:
1. Focal mild bile duct proliferation with associated 
neutrophils, recommend evaluation to rule out biliary 
obstruction, ischemia or sepsis.
2. Scattered lobular neutrophilic microabscesses. CMV 
immunostain is negative.
3. No features of rejection are seen.
4. No steatosis seen.
5. No definite features of recurrence of viral hepatitis C seen.
6. Trichrome stain shows no increased fibrosis.
7. Iron stain shows no increased fibrosis.

___ MRCP
IMPRESSION: 
1. Transplanted liver with patent arterial and venous 
anastomoses.  Apparent narrowing at the biliary anastomosis is 
may reflect mismatched duct diameters between the donor and 
recipient. 
2. Unchanged prominence of the intrahepatic biliary ducts.  No 
new dilation. Focal arterial hyper enhancement and restricted 
diffusion around a dilated biliary duct in segment VI is most 
compatible with a focus of mild cholangitis.  No fluid 
collection. 
3. Interval decrease in size of a right upper quadrant 
intramuscular hematoma. 

ERCP ___
IMPRESSION:
The scout film was normal. 
The bile duct was deeply cannulated with the sphincterotome. 
Contrast was injected and there was flow through the ducts. 
Contrast extended to the entire biliary tree. 
There was a short stricture at the CHD in keeping with an 
anastomotic stricture vs duct mismatch. 
The left and right hepatic ducts and all intrahepatic branches 
were mildly dilated. 
A biliary sphincterotomy was made with a sphincterotome. There 
was no post-sphincterotomy bleeding. 
A ___ x 8 cm plastic stent was placed into the main duct. 
Excellent bile and contrast drainage was seen endoscopically and

ACUTE ISSUES:
========================== 
# ___ - AST 133/ALT 237 was on admission, increased 
from baseline. Patient recently underwent liver transplant 2 
months ago and was on cyclosporin and mycophenolate for 
immunosuppression. His liver ultrasound demonstrated evidence of 
hepatic arterial stenosis at the hepatic artery anastomosis with 
kinking noted, concerning for transplant rejection. The day 
prior to admission, he underwent urgent biopsy by ___ on ___, 
which showed focal mild bile duct proliferation with associated 
neutrophils concerning biliary obstruction, ischemia or sepsis. 
No evidence of transplant rejection, CMV (viral load negative), 
or active hepatitis C was seen on biopsy. MRCP was then 
performed and showed patent transplanted vasculature. Possible 
cholecystitis was also noted, however patient showed no signs of 
infection and had no abdominal pain during the admission. 
Patient then underwent ERCP on ___ with biliary sphincterotomy 
and stent placement in the main biliary duct. He will need to 
undergo another ERCP in ___ weeks for stent removal. 
___ trended down during this admission. His 
cyclosporin 250mg q12h and mycophenolate 720mg BID were 
continued, and doses were not adjusted as biopsy did not show 
evidence of rejection. Patient was also started on 5 day course 
of cipro post-ERCP for prophylaxis. He was tolerating PO well 
the next day without abdominal pain and was discharged.

# ___ on CKD - Patient was admitted for creatinine of 1.9 from 
baseline of 1.0-1.5. Improved to baseline after IVF. 
 
CHRONIC ISSUES:
========================
# HTN: Continued amlodipine 5mg, metoprolol 25mg
# DM: Decreased glargine to 6u as patient's glucose was 
low-normal during this admission
# GERD: Continued omeprazole 20mg
# Depression: Continued sertraline 100mg 
# Prophylaxis - continued Bactrim. Valganciclovir dose was 
decreased to 450mg from 900mg due to renal function. 

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
==========================
- Patient will need weekly cyclosporine levels and LFTs. 
Cyclosporine level on ___ was 146
- Patient will follow-up with Transplant Hepatology on ___.
- Repeat ERCP in ___ months for stent pull and re-evaluation. 
- Continue with antibiotics - Ciprofloxacin 500mg BID x 5 days 
ending on ___.
