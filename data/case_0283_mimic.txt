Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ is a ___ yo M with right femoral pseduoaneurysm. He 
was admitted ___ for scheduled aneurysm resection w Dacron 
interposition graft as well as DCB angioplasty of distal fem pop 
anastomosis. Estimated blood loss was 200 during the case, and 
the case went well. He was transferred to the vascular surgery 
service floor postoperatively. He did well following surgery. 
Within 24 hours his pain was adequately controlled on po 
medication, he was able to get out of bed to chair. He did 
require a straight catheterization of his bladder x1 due to 
urinary retention however this resolved. He began tolerating 
regular diet and resumed his home medications. On ___ in 
the AM he reported some right wrist pain, however there were no 
physical exam findings to accompany this pain and it was managed 
symptomatically at onset. Later over the course of the evening 
he developed erythema and swelling of the right wrist, extending 
over the soft tissues of the dorsal wrist and hand, and to the 
knuckle of the right ring finger. The patient endorses 
significant pain with ROM. He disclosed a history of similar 
such symptoms (approximately 5 episodes total) for which he was 
treated at an outside hospital with Keflex and experienced 
complete resolution of symptoms, per his report. The medicine 
service was consulted for this problem, and empiric Keflex po 
was initiated. The medicine service agreed with this plan, 
though they maintained a suspicion of rheumatologic etiology. 12 
hours following the initiation of antibiotic therapy the 
erythema and swelling improved substantially, and the pain 
decreased. Given the patient's near complete resolution of wrist 
symptoms, it was determined that Keflex was an appropriate 
therapy. A DVT u/s was done at the time of symptoms onset and 
yielded no acute thrombus or occlusion. Once appropriate the 
patient was discharged with instructions on wound care and 
following up in clinic. He was instructed to follow up with his 
PCP (who was notified via telephone msg) regarding this 
recurrent hand erythema/swelling.
