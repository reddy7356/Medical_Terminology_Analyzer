Brief Hospital Course:
SUMMARY 
========
___ with PMHx of ovarian cysts, severe chronic pain, POTS, PUD, 
substance abuse who presented with one day of increased erythema 
around right chest tunneled line site. ___ evaluated the site and 
removed the tunneled line and sent the tip for culture. The 
overlying skin changes were more consistent with 
contact/irritant dermatitis. She was not given antibiotics. She 
did not have a fever and mild leukocytosis on admission resolved 
by the time of discharge. Local wound care with lotion and 
desonide was used with relief. She had a midline placed for 
continuation of home IV fluids. She will discuss with her PCP as 
an outpatient about replacing the tunneled catheter line. 

ACTIVE ISSUES 
============

# Contact Dermatitis, corresponding to area of interest, 6x6cm 
erythematous plaque right chest wall. She presented to care with 
concern for local skin infection and involvement of the tunneled 
line site. Tunneled line was pulled in the ED prior to admission 
to the floor but upon evaluation the surrounding skin appeared 
consistent with an irritant, contact dermatitis.  Most likely in 
setting of reaction to tegaderm used to cover tunneled line at 
home. There were no clinical signs of cellulitis or systemic 
infection. Erythema and puritis improved with sarna and 
lidocaine lotion and desonide cream. Wound care was consulted 
who recommended Dermatology follow up for allergy/patch testing 
in the setting of frequent skin eruptions.  

# Leukocytosis. Initially >11 without neutrophilic predominance. 
This self resolved without antibiotics.  She remained afebrile. 
Nonetheless her tunneled line was removed ___ in the ED given 
concern for possible infection. The catheter tip was sent for 
culture which was pending at the time of discharge.

# Chronic dehydration 
# h/o POTS. Patient had tunneled line placed in ___ 
in order for home administration of IVF. Given continued need 
for ___ IVF supplemental/day at home, she had midline placed 
in her left arm on ___. Plan for outpatient coordination of 
replacing tunneled line when right chest irritant dermatitis 
resolves via PCPs office.  

# Recurrent DVT (RLE ___ after ankle surgery, and ___ assoc'd 
DVT x2 in ___. Followed by Dr. ___ in ___ ___. 
Maintained on 1.5mg/kg daily (90mg rounded to 80mg vial size) 
Lovenox once daily for treatment.  

CHRONIC ISSUES 
=============
# Anxiety/Depression. Continued Venlafaxine 150mg BID.  
# Severe chronic pain. Follow by ___ pain center, last seen in 
___. Continued home regimen of Tizanidine 
# H/o substance abuse. Per records. Not discussed with patient 
directly. Has outpatient follow up.
# Subtotal colectomy. BM ___ times/day, at current baseline. IVF 
repletion provided daily prn. No electrolyte abnormalities 
suggestive of dehydration. 
# ___ disc buldge with neural foraminal stenosis 
# Right hand paresthesia. She presented with chronic right hand 
paresthesia, chronic, likely in setting of cervical nerve root 
compression or more proximal nerve root compression in forearm. 
Negative right upper extremity ultrasound for DVT reassuring in 
ED. Strength in tact and strong right radial pulse also 
reassuring. 

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES 
===================
PCP ___ clinical follow up of right chest wall dermatitis at 
follow up to ensure improvement/resolution 
- Continue Desonide for ___ days 
- Midline placed for temporary use at home for IVF and IV 
Vitamin administration, with coordination of replacing tunneled 
catheter to be coordinated by PCP when indicated. 
- Wound care recs: Recommend using Duoderm thin as a platform 
around line sites so occlusive dressing is not directly on 
patient's skin.
- Wound culture tip from tunneled catheter line pending at the 
time of discharge to be followed by PCP. 
- Per inpatient wound care team, recommend Dermatology follow up 
as outpatient for possible patch testing. Appointment made

Discharge Instructions:
Hello Ms. ___,

You were admitted to the hospital on ___ due to low grade 
fever as well as redness, swelling, and tenderness that appeared 
around your PICC line site in the right arm since ___, 
___. 

In the hospital we did an ultrasound examination on the veins of 
your upper extremities and discovered clots in two veins in your 
right arm, adjacent to the PICC line. 

Therefore, we removed the PICC line and placed a tunneled line 
instead. The tunneled line is advantageous as it is placed in a 
wider vein that connects directly to the heart, and thereby 
reduces the risk of blood clot formation. You should continue 
your anticoagulant which will also help treat and prevent blood 
clots. You will continue your intravenous hydration via this 
tunneled line. 

Sincerely,
Your ___ Team

POTS (on home IVF), multiple admission for line infections (most 
recent MSSA bacteremia ___, colectomy (___), chronic pain, 
chronic fatigue, who presented with septic shock growing GNRs of 
unclear source, started on broad spectrum antibiotics. However, 
patient left on hospital day #2 against advice of medical team. 

#Left hospital against medical advice prior to receiving 
discharge paperwork or medicaitons. 
On hospital day 2, Ms. ___ wanted to leave against medical 
advice.
She was very upset and said she wanted to go home to get medical
care at home. Dr. ___ explained to her that she has gram 
negative rod
bacteremia making it unsafe  to go home. She said she didn't 
care if she died, was very upset and tearful. Medical team did 
not feel that she had capacity to leave against medical advice. 
Consulted psychiatry to evaluate the patient for capacity. She 
waited in the FICU waiting room because she refused to come back
onto the FICU unit. Psychiatry evaluated Ms. ___ and ___ she 
did have capacity to leave against medical advice. While 
preparing her paperwork, she left the hospital against medical 
advice and did not receive discharge paperwork or antibiotics, 
saying that she would be walking across the street to ___ to 
receive medical care there. Medical team contacted ___ who 
confirmed patient had been admitted and we spoke with a nurse 
___ relating that the patient was growing gram negative rods on 
blood culture. 

#Septic shock 
#GNR bacteremia
Presented with low blood pressures 80-90/50s. lactate elevated 
to 3.5, bandemia (but normal WBCs). Patient reported one day of 
fever, headache, photophobia, and sore throat. She was started 
on vancomycin/cefepime. Blood pressure improved to 110s/70s 
after fluid resuscitation (4L in the ED, 2L on the floor). Gram 
stain of blood cultures on admission returned as GNRs 
(speciation pending). At the time of elopement was undergoing 
investigation for source including urine culture as well as 
consideration of an LP due to c/f meningitis. CXR on admission 
without consolidation. Line infection considered less likely 
given GNRs and no evidence of surrounding cellulitis. Other 
pertinent work up included negative flu swab. Patient was 
adamant that she wanted to be DNR/DNI and did not want any 
procedures, felt that the team was not listening to her wishes, 
and left hospital as described above.  
 
#Transamnitis
ALT/AST mildly elevated c/w with hepatocellular etiology. She 
reported daily use of Tylenol 1 g twice daily for chronic pain 
but no recent change to that. Tylenol level 9, so NAC protocol 
not started. DDx included viral, drug-induced, autoimmune. Less 
likely ischemic given low transaminitis level. Labs ordered for 
work up included Hep A/B/C (pending), serum tox screen 
(negative, autoimmune hepatitis panel.

Brief Hospital Course:
___ F with medical history notable for POTS on home IVF, 2 
admissions for potential line infections without bacteremia 
(most recent ___ for (+) pseudomonal IV tip midline culture 
without bacteremia) who presented with red rash in right 
antecubital fossa and c/f midline infection: 

#RUE MIDLINE CONTACT DERMATITIS 
Presented with right antecubital erythema and prurutitis. 
Initial concern was for cellulitis in the ED, but was seen by 
dermatology who felt this was contact dermatitis. Received 
topical clobetasol with drastic improvement in her dermatitis at 
time of discharge. She was continued on loratadine, cetirizine, 
diphenhydramine, and chlorpheniramine. Clebetasol ointment BID 
to arms ___ days (___). We are working to arrange patch 
testing as an outpatient. For procedural prep, would recommend 
iodine-based solution for now unless patient objects. 

#STAPH COAG POSITIVE IV TIP
When she presented with right antecubital fossa erythema, her IV 
was pulled and tip was cultures. Her IV tip grew coag positive 
staph (pan sensitive). All of her BCx were negative. This is her 
second possible midline infection which has been BCx negative. 
Suspicion is for skin contaminant when tip pulled out. She 
completed 5 days IV abx (vanc with switch to cefazolin). Her 
overlying erythema and pruritis is though to be due to contact 
dermatitis from her allergy to line dressings and creams. 
Infectious disease was consulted who recommended AGAINST pulling 
future lines or sending the cath tip for culture unless the 
patient has fever, leukocytosis, instability or positive blood 
cultures.

#ACCESS ISSUES
Requires IVF for refractort POTS. Has had thrombus associated 
with PICC in the past and multiple midlines pulled due to 
?infection which are most likely contact dermatitis rather than 
cellulitis. She ultimately had tunneled RIJ placed by radiology 
on ___. She will have ___ services for help with dressing 
changes. 

# POTS requiring IVF AT HOME
Has refractory POTS likely exacerbated by partial colectomy in 
the setting of constipation. Requires access for this. IVF was 
continued during this hospitalization. 

# RECURRENT DVT (RLE ___ after ankle surgery, and PICC assoc'd 
DVT x2 in ___: 
Followed by Dr. ___ in ___ ___. Maintained on 
1.5mg/kg daily (90mg rounded to 80mg vial size). Held for 
tunneled line, but resumed on enoxaparin 80mg sq daily. FYI, she 
is not on NOAC due to suspected poor absorption (partial 
colectomy and chronic diarrhea). 

# PARTIAL SIGMOIDECTOMY: In ___ for refractory constipation, 
now with loost BM 4 times/day, at current baseline. This may be 
contributing to her dehydration and refractory POTS. Continued 
loperamide, psyllium prn. If BMs thickened in the future, 
consider re-trial of salt tabs and hydration for POTS.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: 
====================
#MEDICATIONS: Please see discharge worksheet for medication 
changes. 
[] If concern for future line infection, please do not remove 
future IV access unless febrile, unstable or leukocytosis. Get 
BCx first and consult with infectious disease and IV team before 
pulling the line. 
[] For procedural prep, would recommend iodine-based solution 
for now unless patient objects 
[] She has very allergic type skin. We will refer for patch 
testing as outpatient. 
[] We started clobetasol 0.05% ointment BID x ___ days to 
affected area on both AC fossae (___)
[] If BMs thickened in the future, consider re-trial of salt 
tabs and hydration for POTS.

Ms. ___ is a ___ yo F w/ PMH POTS (on home IVF), 
multiple
admission for line infections (most recent ___, who presents
with concern for infected tunneled line. 

The patient reports she developed fevers and chills the night
prior to hospital admission. She had her home nurse evaluate her
line in the morning. The home nurse was concerned so she sent 
the
patient to ___ for evaluation of possible infection. At ___ 
clinic,
she was tachycardic up to the 140s. Her line was pulled back and
a large amount of malodorous pus was noted from the tunneled 
site
c/w infection. She also had R chest skin erythema determined to
be contact dermatitis from tegaderm. She follows with 
dermatology
for this condition. 

She was sent to the ED for further evaluation. She requires a
central line for vitamin/fluids, which if she does not receive
fluids she experiences syncope.   

In the ED, the patient reported fatigue, lethargy, dizziness,
nausea, SOB. She denied CP. 

Initial VS were: Tc 99.2 102 121/82 18 100% RA

Brief Hospital Course:
Key Information for Outpatient Providers:Ms. ___ is a 
___ yo F w/ PMH POTS who presents with MSSA bacteremia ___ 
tunneled line infection. 

ACTIVE PROBLEMS:
================

#MSSA Bacteremia and CLABSI: Patient presented with a Hickman 
catheter that had become lodged in the tunnel. The suture was up 
in the tunnel. Upon withdrawing and removing the catheter in ___ 
frank pus was removed. Patient stated she had some subjective 
fevers to just over ___ F, occasional chills, baseline nausea 
and loose stools. Before blood cultures were returned, patient 
was treated with Vancomycin and Cefepime. She was narrowed to 
Vancomycin upon finding gram positive cocci in clusters. Finally 
she was narrowed to 2 g cefazolin q8h with a MSSA bacteremia. 
She continued to have itching and some swelling with cefazolin 
requiring IV Benadryl. Transitioned to Daptomycin ___ daily 
in an effort to not require IV Benadryl, that was also not 
tolerated. The patient was able to tolerate Ceftriaxone without 
IV Benadryl, thus it was chosen as agent for discharge. As the 
patient has had recurrent line infections, she will begin 2 hour 
ethanol dwells to minimize future risk of infection. She will 
also have a new dressing that is to minimize infection. 72 hours 
after having negative cultures the patient returned to ___ for a 
new line. She was discharged to home with services for her 
ongoing 2 weeks of ceftriaxone (end day ___. 

#Contact dermatitis: Last time the patient was admitted for a 
line infection, cultures were negative and the patient was found 
to have allergic contact dermatitis. Out of concern for repeat 
contact dermatitis, the patient was treated with Clobetasol 
Propionate TID to affected area. After the placement of her new 
central line a new dressing was used which the patient 
tolerated, but she had an episode of bleeding from the line site 
requiring a suture and re-dressing of the site which resulted in 
warmth, swelling and erythema. It was examined by ___, re-dressed 
with her new dressing instead of a tegaderm and the warmth 
abated, the swelling decreased and the erythema improved. 

CHRONIC ISSUES:
===============
# POTS: Patient with chronic POTTs. At home she receives about 3 
L of fluid daily in 3 boluses. She had a peripheral line in the 
hospital and veins sensitive to flow, thus she was infused at a 
slow maintenance rate 3L/24 hours with normal saline throughout 
her admission. 

# GERD: Ranitidine 150 mg PO/NG BID was continued in the 
hospital. 

# Depression / Anxiety: Venlafaxine 150 mg PO/NG BID were 
continued in the hospital

# Recurrent DVTs: Followed by Dr. ___ in ___ ___. Her 
lovenox was continued. 

# s/p Partial sigmoidectomy: In ___ for refractory 
constipation, now with loose BMs. Possible contributor to POTS. 
She continued her loperamide, psyllium prn while in the 
hospital. 

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
==================
- Cardiology recommended outpatient surface ECHO for MVP/TVP 
once stabilized 
- Cardiology recommended ___ year surface ECHO to evaluate 
MVP/TVP
- Central line nurse recommended new dressing that has 
antibiotics in it. Patient has package and fresh dressing on 
discharge. She will require further dressings for home. 
- Patient will have follow up with her PCP ___ on 
___
- Patient does not require further follow up from ___

___ ED on ___ with 2 weeks of pain along the course of her 
PICC line, 1 week of fevers, and difficulty infusing fluids 
through her PICC.(previously on 

The pt reports she has had dull pain along the course of her 
PICC line (from her L arm to her L axilla) ever since her PICC 
was placed.  The PICC has also been difficult to use, with fluid 
infusions requiring ~3.5 hours (this is an improvement from when 
the PICC was first placed, when infusions would take ~7 hours).  
She is able to flush and draw from the line without issues.  For 
the past week, the pt has suffered from intermittent fevers (her 
maximum recorded temperature was 103) and chills.  She was seen 
by her ___ on ___, who became concerned because the patient's 
temperature was 95 and she was shivering.  She was sent to her 
PCP, who transferred her to the ___.

Upon arrival to the ___ ED, her vitals were Temp 98, HR 90, BP 
102/81, RR 20, and SpO2 100% on RA.  On exam in the ED, the pt's 
L PICC site was without tenderness or erythema, and her LUE was 
non-edematous.  CBC, BMP, and UA were WNL.  CXR showed no acute 
cardiopulmonary process, but LUE US showed partially-occlusive 
DVT in the L subclavian/axillary veins.  In the ED, she was 
treated with 1g IV Vancomycin and 60 mg SC Lovenox.  As the 
Vancomycin drip was finishing, the pt began to complain of 
diffuse pruritis and developed a rash throughout her neck and 
torso. She did not have any chest pain or SOB.  She was treated 
with Benadryl 50mg PO x1, and her symptoms and the rash 
improved.  Vitals at the time of transfer were Temp 98.1, HR 81, 
BP 106/63, RR 18, SpO2 98% on RA.

On arrival to the floor, the pt stated her pruritis was 
improved.  There were no overnight events.  This morning, the pt 
continues to complain of dull pain in her LUE, along the course 
of her PICC line, but has no other complaints.  She denies any 
pruritis. She denies any sick contacts or recent travel.  She 
denies any runny nose, sore throat, SOB, abdominal pain, changes 
in her stools (she has 5 loose BMs/day at baseline), or dysuria.

Brief Hospital Course:
___ is a ___ woman with history of chronic 
constipation (s/p subtotal colectomy in ___, now with 
chronic diarrhea), s/p PICC placement on ___ for IV 
hydration, and history of DVT (previously on Warfarin) who 
presented to the ___ ED on ___ with 2 weeks of pain along 
the course of her PICC line, 1 week of fevers, and difficulty 
infusing fluids through her PICC, and was found to have DVT 
surrounding the LUE PICC line.

#L upper extremity DVT: The pt has history of previous lower 
extremity DVT at age ~___, and states she was briefly on 
Warfarin. She presented with 2 weeks of pain along the course of 
her PICC line, 1 week of fevers, and difficulty infusing fluids 
through the line (she states that her infusions can take ~3 
hours, but this is actually an improvement from when she first 
got the PICC line and it would take ~7 hours). Her exam was 
notable for mild tenderness to palpation along the course of her 
PICC line, but no LUE edema or pain with movement. ___ US 
identified a partially-occlusive DVT surrounding her PICC line. 
She was started on Lovenox SC BID to prevent pulmonary embolism. 
Her L PICC line was removed on ___. Blood Cx showed no 
growth for 84h, and a R PICC line was placed on ___. Proper 
placement of the new R PICC was confirmed with CXR.

#Fevers: The pt presented with 1 week of fevers, but no symptoms 
of localized infection. Her fevers were likely due to the DVT. 
WBC count was normal at 7.4 on admission, CXR was negative for 
pneumonia, UA was negative for UTI, and blood Cx showed no 
growth in 84 h. 

#Rash, pruritis: The pt developed pruritis and rash at end of 1g 
IV Vancomycin infusion in the ED. The exact rate of infusion is 
unknown. There was no evidence of anaphylaxis. This was likely a 
mild pseudoallergic reaction (Red Man syndrome) due to rapid 
Vancomycin infusion. IgE-mediated hypersensitivity unlikely 
given no respiratory compromise or history of previous exposure 
to Vancomycin. The pt was given PO Benadryl 50 mg x1, and her 
rash and pruritis resolved. She did not receive any more 
vancomycin during this admission, and had no further episodes of 
pruritis/rash.

#Chronic diarrhea: Pt has longstanding diarrhea ___ partial 
colectomy in ___ for chronic constipation. Extensive 
rheumatologic work-up has been negative. Pt has 5 loose BMs/day 
at baseline, and has not had any recent changes in her bowel 
habits. She remained at her baseline throughout this admission 
and received IV hydration as needed.
