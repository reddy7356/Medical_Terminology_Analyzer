Attending: ___.
 
Chief Complaint:
Parathyroid Adenoma
 
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Parathyroidectomy

 
History of Present Illness:
The patient is a ___ woman who underwent excision of a 
parathyroid adenoma corresponding to the right upper parathyroid 
gland approximately ___ year
ago. At the time of that surgery found a parathyroid 
adenoma-like structure corresponding to the right upper gland 
weighing 110 mg. Exploration on the left side resulted in 
excision of left lower parathyroid gland which on permanent 
section, however, turned out to be a normal gland (frozen 
section of biopsy had indicated hyperplasia) and a biopsy of a 
left upper normal parathyroid gland. The patient has continued 
to be hypercalcemic and has evidence of persistent
hyperparathyroidism. Further workup has provided evidence for a 
nodule in the right thyroid lobe's inferior aspect and an 
ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration biopsy yielded cytology 
that on immunohistochemistry was consistent with parathyroid 
cells and, in addition to that, an aspirate yielded parathyroid 
hormone level above 5000 pg/mL from that nodule. Therefore at 
this point there is evidence that the patient's persistent 
hyperparathyroidism is caused by an intrathyroidal adenoma in 
the right thyroid lobe's inferior
aspect. The patient was scheduled today for parathyroidectomy 
and most likely this will consist of a right thyroid lobectomy.
