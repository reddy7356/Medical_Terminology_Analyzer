History of Present Illness:
Mr. ___ is a ___ male with no prior PMH who
presents for a hand infection. The history is gathered from the
daughter, the pt using his daughter as an interpreter (with the
pt's consent), and records. The pt first noticed left hand and
wrist swelling and pain on ___. He had no unusual
exposures. He had not been camping, gardening, in contact with
animals, recently ill, recently exposed to antibiotics or a
hospital setting, or recently traveled. He had no water 
exposure.
He had no known cuts, breaks in the skin, or trauma.

The swelling worsened and the pt reported was given doxycycline
by his PCP without improvement. He then went to ___ where he
received dalbavancin ___ with some initial improvement. However
the swelling recurred. He was given cephalexin, then ___ the
abx were changed from cephalexin to ciprofloxacin + fluconazole
200 mg daily (plan for 10 days total) + three days of prednisone
80 mg PO daily. Again, there was no improvement. The swelling
tended to fluctuate but has been worse over the past ___ days.

wrist and tenderness with palpation of the wrist and dorsal 
hand.

Hand X-Ray:  
1. Soft tissue swelling of the dorsum of the left hand without 
underlying bony lucency to suggest osteomyelitis.  No acute 
fracture.
2. Widening of the scapholunate interval without significant 
proximal migration of the capitate, consistent with scapholunate 
dissociation.  Mild resultant degenerative changes in the distal 
lunate and radius.
     
Hand US:
Subcutaneous edema noted throughout the left posterior wrist and 
hand.  No discrete fluid collection identified.
  
MRI Hand Wetread:
  
1.  No findings to suggest osteomyelitis.  No drainable Fluid 
collection or rim enhancing abscess seen. 
2.  Moderate diffuse subcutaneous edema, most severe along the 
dorsal surface. Findings are consistent mild radiocarpal 
synovitis and tenosynovitis in the extensor and flexor 
compartments, particularly involving the second, third and 
fourth compartments, flexor pollicis longus and flexor digitorum 
tendons. There is also evidence of mild tendinosis involving the 
ECU, and mild patchy myositis.  These findings are likely 
related to inflammatory arthropathy/reactive changes, however 
infection cannot be entirely excluded. 
3.  Chronic scapholunate ligamentous tear, and dorsal tilt of 
the lunate 
consistent with DISI. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ is a ___ yo man with no significant PMH who presents with 
left hand swelling and pain initially concerning for cellulitis 
x1 month which has failed multiple outpatient courses of 
antibiotics and diagnosed with inflammatory arthritis.
     
# Left wrist and hand inflammatory arthritis 
Presented to ___ with recurrent painful arthritis of left 
wrist and hand which was treated over the course of the month 
prior to admission as an outpatient for cellulitis without 
significant improvement. Records from ___ indicate he was 
treated multiple times with dalbavancin and also received a 
short course of 80mg Prednisone which improved his symptoms. 
Hand surgery evaluated inpatient and felt unlikely to be 
infectioous arthritis. Rheumatology evaluated and agrees likely 
inflammatory arthritis. No sign of compartment syndrome or 
necrotizing fasciitis throughout admission, and with good 
perfusion. X-ray of hand without acute fracture, dislocation or 
evidence of OM. MRI performed and showed mild radiocarpal 
synovitis and tenosynovitis in the extensor and flexor 
compartments, mild tendinosis involving the ECU, and mild patchy 
myositis, likely related to inflammatory arthropathy / reactive 
changes. He was started on Prednisone 20mg daily and Colchicine 
0.6mg PO BID and demonstrated rapid improvement in symptoms. He 
was discharged to continue the same regimen until seen in 
___ clinic 1 week post discharge. He was also 
prescribed a Volar wrist splint, which was provided prior to 
discharge.
