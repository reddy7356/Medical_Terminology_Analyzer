=============
ACUTE ISSUES:
=============
#Severe Asymptomatic Hypertension
The patient was noted to be hypertensive at her ortho 
appointment in the setting of missing her home Losartan 100mg PO 
daily for 72 hours. On arrival to the ED, her SBP was 200 and 
she was given a dose of Labetolol 100mg. Her BP improved with 
this and was in the 160s on arrival to the floor. She had a 
slight ___ (discussed below) which resolved with better blood 
pressure control. She had no other signs of end organ damage 
including no EKG changes or LFT derangements. When her Cr 
normalized, she was restarted on her home Losartan 100mg PO 
daily and discharged home. Blood pressure on discharge was 161 / 
71.

___ on CKD
Baseline Cr ~1.1. Found to have mildly elevated Cr 1.3 in ED. 
She was given one liter of NS and this returned to baseline with 
improvement in her blood pressure. Her Losartan was initially 
held in this setting, however this was restarted with 
normalization of her creatinine as above. Creatinine was 1.2 on 
discharge.

===============
CHRONIC ISSUES:
===============
#Normocytic Anemia
#Anemia of Chronic Disease
Baseline hgb ___. Discharge Hgb was 8.9.

#GERD: Continued omeprazole 20mg daily

#Knee OA: Continued acetaminophen as needed

#HLD: Continued simvastatin 20mg

#Insomnia: Continued mirtazapine 7.5mg qHS, continued trazodone 
PRN

#Osteoporosis: Continued Ca and VitD supplementation

#Glaucoma: Continued latanoprost

#Stroke Prevention: Continued ASA 81mg

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
[] Please ensure that pt has antihypertensives at home
[] If needs further BP control, consider adding CACB
[] Would consider alternative analgesic rather than Ibuprofen 
given CKD, limit Ibuprofen if only effective agent
[] Please draw BMP at first f/u: Discharge Cr 1.2

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the orthopedic surgery service and 
was taken to the operating room for above described procedure. 
Please see separately dictated operative report for details. The 
surgery was uncomplicated and the patient tolerated the 
procedure well. Patient received perioperative IV antibiotics.

Postoperative course was remarkable for the following:
On POD#1, the patient's hematocrit was 21.9 and she was 
transfused with 2 units of blood.  On POD#2, her hematocrit was 
27.4.  On POD#2, she was noted to be in ___ on EKG.  
Cardiology was contacted.  No intervention needed.  This was 
unchanged from pre-op where she was given cardiac clearance 
prior to surgery.  The patient should follow-up with her primary 
care physician upon discharge to determine if a further work-up 
is indicated.  Urines were also ordered on POD#2 due to an 
increasing white count.  Urinalysis was negative.  Urine culture 
was negative as well.  Her white count had resolved at time of 
discharge.  On day of discharge, the patient was noted to have a 
developing hematoma.  She was instructed to ice and elevate 
frequently to help resolve this.

Otherwise, pain was controlled with a combination of IV and oral 
pain medications.  The patient received Aspirin 325 mg twice 
daily for DVT prophylaxis starting on the morning of POD#1.  The 
overlying surgical dressing was changed on POD#2 and the 
Silverlon dressing was found to be clean and intact without 
erythema or abnormal drainage. The patient was seen daily by 
physical therapy. Labs were checked throughout the hospital 
course and repleted accordingly. At the time of discharge the 
patient was tolerating a regular diet and feeling well.  The 
patient was afebrile with stable vital signs.  The patient's 
hematocrit was acceptable and pain was adequately controlled on 
an oral regimen. The operative extremity was neurovascularly 
intact and the wound was benign. 

The patient's weight-bearing status is weight bearing as 
tolerated on the operative extremity. 
 
Ms. ___ is discharged to home with services in stable 
condition.

or cane).

 
Discharge Instructions:
1. Please return to the emergency department or notify your 
physician if you experience any of the following: severe pain 
not relieved by medication, increased swelling, decreased 
sensation, difficulty with movement, fevers greater than 101.5, 
shaking chills, increasing redness or drainage from the incision 
site, chest pain, shortness of breath or any other concerns.
 
2. Please follow up with your primary physician regarding this 
admission and any new medications and refills. 
 
3. Resume your home medications unless otherwise instructed.
 
4. You have been given medications for pain control. Please do 
not drive, operate heavy machinery, or drink alcohol while 
taking these medications. As your pain decreases, take fewer 
tablets and increase the time between doses. This medication can 
cause constipation, so you should drink plenty of water daily 
and take a stool softener (such as Colace) as needed to prevent 
this side effect.  Call your surgeons office 3 days before you 
are out of medication so that it can be refilled.  These 
medications cannot be called into your pharmacy and must be 
picked up in the clinic or mailed to your house.  Please allow 
an extra 2 days if you would like your medication mailed to your 
home.

surgeon.
 
6. Please call your surgeon's office to schedule or confirm your 
follow-up appointment in three (3) weeks.
 
7. SWELLING: Ice the operative joint 20 minutes at a time, 
especially after activity or physical therapy. Do not place ice 
directly on the skin. You may wrap the knee with an ace bandage 
for added compression. Please DO NOT take any non-steroidal 
anti-inflammatory medications (NSAIDs such as Celebrex, 
ibuprofen, Advil, Aleve, Motrin, naproxen etc) until cleared by 
your physician.
 
8. ANTICOAGULATION: Please continue your Aspirin 325 mg twice 
daily with food for four (4) weeks to help prevent deep vein 
thrombosis (blood clots).  Continue home dose of Omeprazole 
while on Aspirin to prevent GI upset (x 4 weeks).  If you were 
taking Aspirin prior to your surgery, take it at 325 mg twice 
daily until the end of the 4 weeks, then you can go back to your 
normal dosing.
 
9. WOUND CARE: Please keep your incision clean and dry. It is 
okay to shower five days after surgery but no tub baths, 
swimming, or submerging your incision until after your four (4) 
week checkup. Please place a dry sterile dressing on the wound 
each day if there is drainage, otherwise leave it open to air. 
Check wound regularly for signs of infection such as redness or 
thick yellow drainage. Staples will be removed by your doctor at 
follow-up appointment approximately 3 weeks after surgery.
 
10. ___ (once at home): Home ___, dressing changes as 
instructed, and wound checks.
 
11. ACTIVITY: Weight bearing as tolerated on the operative 
extremity. Mobilize with assistive devices (___) if

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ is an ___ Y/o woman with past medical history 
significant for hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and anemia, 
unifocal ventricular ectopy, LVH, renal insufficiency, and 
bigeminy presenting after an episode of pre-syncope at home, 
resolved prior to admission. 

#Pre-Syncope vs Vertigo: Given history of bigeminy with 
bradycardia on admission, there was suspicion for arrhythmia as 
a cause for her symptoms. The differential also included 
orthostatic hypotension though her orthostatics were negative. 
Her symptoms were not consistent with seizure or 
neurocardiogenic etiology. She was monitored on telemetry 
throughout her hospital stay, which was significant for bigeminy 
and trigeminy, though she remained asymptomatic. She was 
evaluated by Dr. ___, with electrophysiology, who 
determined that her symptoms and telemetry findings are not 
related. In addition, the team determined that her arrhythmia is 
benign and and does not require further intervention either as 
an inpatient or as an outpatient. No medication regimen changes 
were recommended and she was determined to be safe for discharge 
home. 

# Hypertension: Home losartan was continued. HCTZ initially 
held, though restarted once orthostatics were negative. 
# GERD: Home omeprazole continued
# HLD: Home simvastatin continued
# Iron deficiency anemia: stable and chronic- continued home 
iron

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___, it was a pleasure to take care of you while you 
were in the hospital. You were admitted after you had an episode 
of dizziness at home. We were concerned that this may have been 
due to an abnormal hearth rhythm. We placed you on a heart 
monitor and observed you closely throughout the hospital stay. 
We consulted the cardiology team and together we determined that 
your symptoms were unlikely to be due to an arrhythmia, and in 
fact may have been an episode of vertigo. We now feel that you 
are safe to discharge home without a change to your medication 
regimen.
