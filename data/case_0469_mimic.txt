Brief Hospital Course:
Briefly, Mr. ___ is an ___ year old man with h/o DM, colon ca 
s/p transverse colectomy in ___ c/b incisional hernia/poor 
wound healing, advanced dementia, and HTN. He presented from his 
SNF with fever, abd distention, vomiting X2, and lethargy. Pt is 
a resident ___. He had 3 days of cold 
symptoms, 2 days of constipation and was noted to have decreased 
appetite and overall depressed functioning compared to baseline. 
On ___, he had a fever to 100.8 and emesis of yellowish 
nonbloody material X2 which led to transfer to ED.   
In the ED, initial vs were: T 106.1 P ___ BP 161/82 R 18 94%O2on 
RA, Patient was given 1 g Vanc, 4.5 g Zosyn, Tylenol 1g and 2 
litres of NS. Ice packs were placed to cool him. He was admitted 
to MICU for consideration of artic sun for cooling. 
However, since in MICU, remained afebrile. Hemodynamically 
stable. MS appears to be at his baseline. Was found to have UTI 
so Abx changed to CTx. CXR was negative for PNA. Blood cx 
negative. He got total 3L IVFs in ICU and  ER. Given his prompt 
improvement he was transfered out of MICU next day. On the floor 
he continued to do well. MS appeared at baseline, occasional 
sundowning but was redirectable. Abx were converted to cefpodox 
for UCx showing pansensitive enterobacter, for total 10day 
course. He had ARF on CKD on admission, which resolved back to 
baseline 1.2 with fluids. He developed mild pulm edema after 3L 
on admission, but this improved when resuming his home dose of 
lasix. As for his constipation, he had several BMs here that 
were well formed. There were no other issues. Discharged back to 
___. 
.
See progress note below for details of plan: 

___ year old man with h/o DM, colon ca s/p transverse colectomy 
in ___ c/b incisional hernia/poor wound healing, advanced 
dementia, chronic dCHF and HTN. He presented from his SNF with 
fever and lethargy and is found to have enterobacter UTI. 
Transfered to floor after brief MICU stable. Doing well and 
ready for t/f back to SNF.  
.
UTI, bacterial: Temp 106 reported in ED on admission (?error, 
may be was 100.6) but otherwise has been stable hemodynamically. 
Mild delirium that has resolved. Recieved empiric vanc/zosyn in 
ER, then CTX X3 days, will change to cefpodox on discharge per 
sensitivities of Enterobacter for 7day course. Blood Cx NTD. 
foley placed in ER and removed next day. Other infectious w/u 
with CXR (given URI symptoms) was negative. 
.
ARF on CKD III: Recent baseline is 1.3 since ___. Was 1.6 on 
admission. Improved to 1.2 after fluids and treatment of UTI 
which was stable on discharge. 
.
Bicytopenia: hct and plt all lower this admission than previous. 
Unclear what hct baseline is (prior ones are during GIB and post 
op). Repeat HCT here were stable around ___ after fluids.  Plt 
in past 300s, now ___ on admission for few days, likely ___ 
infection. Repeat plt improved to 220s on discharge. Coags were 
okay. 
.  
Acute Delirium in setting of advanced dementia: report of 
increased lethargy on admission, which is likely due to UTI. 
This resolved by next day. He appeared to be at baseline. He had 
occ episodes of agitation which may be sundowning rather than 
delirium. He did not need any medications. 
.  
Colon cancer: s/p resection. No abdominal pain.  ventral hernia 
stable but pt has chronic abd stage II ulceration/wound. Seen by 
wound care who provided some recs which will be relayed to ___. 
.
Chronic dCHF: Did develop mild pulm edema on CXR after fluids 
with some wheezing. This improved once his lasix was resumed and 
he did very well, never required O2. Kept on his BB/CCB. 
.

insulin regimen on discharge. kept on statin.

EGD report ___:
Esophagus:  Normal esophagus. 
Stomach:  Other 4 x 8 mm protruding structure with clot 
overlying it at the junction of the fundus and body, likely 
dieulafoy's lesion, although submucosal lesion cannot be 
excluded. There was evidence of active bleeding after the clot 
was rinsed. 3 clips were deployed, 2 of which remained clipped 
to structure, and epinephrine 1 cc x 3 was injected to the base. 
There was resolution of bleeding.  
Duodenum:  The papilla appeared enlarged with question of an 
overlying polyp.  Cold forceps biopsies were performed for 
histology at the papilla major.  
.
 
Brief Hospital Course:
This is an ___ year-old male with h/o dementia, diabetes, 
hypertension who presents with subacute GI bleed.  
.
# OCCULT GI BLEED:  Patient underwent endoscopy on morning 
following admission.  A source of bleeding was identified in his 
stomach (see reports above) and clipped.  The bleeding resolved. 
 After the procedure, his hematocrit stablized with most recent 
23.5, up from 22.6.  He will undergo colonscopy as outpatient to 
further work-up anemia and guiac-positive stools, although we 
believe that the likely source of his anemia has been treated.  
He is being discharged on an increased dose of pantoprazole, 40 
mg PO BID.  Aspirin has been held and should be restarted at the 
discretion of his outpatient doctor.
.
# ANEMIA:  Patient never required transfusion.  His hematocrit 
remained stable throughout admission and began trending upward 
on day of discharge.  The source for his anemia was localized to 
the stomach and treated endoscopically.  He will be discharged 
on home dose of ferrous sulfate.
.
# HYPERTENSION:  His lisinopril has been held during this 
admission for concern of precipitating hypotension in the 
setting of occult blood loss.  Because he has remained 
normotensive throughout with BPs in the 130/60s, we have chosen 
not to restart his lisinopril.  His BP should be monitored as 
outpatient and consideration given to restarting lisinopril 10mg 
qday (his home dose) as needed.
.
# TACHYCARDIA:  His verapramil was held at admission for concern 
of blunting a tachycardic response if he was actively bleeding.  
After the endoscopic procedure demonstrated a site of bleeding 
and the bleeding was stopped, we restarted the verapramil.  His 
heart rate overnight was well controlled in the ___ to ___.
.
# DIABETES:  Glipizide was held and regular insulin sliding 
scale started.  He will be discharged on home dose of glipizide.
.
# HYPERCHOLESTEROL:  Continued home dose of atorvastatin.
.
# SLEEP / AGITATION / DELIRIUM:  Continued home dose of 
trazadone.

CXR: IMPRESSION: No acute cardiopulmonary process.

CT Head:  IMPRESSION: 
1. No acute intracranial process. 
2. Moderate ventricular enlargement and sulcal prominence could 
be 
attributable to age-associated involutionary changes with 
associated chronic 
microangiopathic white matter hypoattenuation. Correlate with 
lumpbar 
puncture opening pressure. 
.
Radiology Report CT ABDOMEN W/CONTRAST Study Date of ___ 
1:42 ___ 
IMPRESSION: 
1. Long segment of irregular, enhancing thickened transverse 
colon wall. The 
differential diagnosis for this finding includes neoplasm such 
as lymphoma or 
primary GI malignancy. Inflammatory bowel disease would be 
unusual in this 
age group. This appearance would be also unusual for an 
infectious etiology 
such as C. diff colitis. Correlation with endoscopy recommended. 

2. Bowel wall thickening at the rectosigmoid junction likely 
represents 
proctitis. 
3. An 8-mm hypodense focus within the right kidney, too small to 

characterized, likely represents a simple cyst. 
.
___ C-scope
Protruding Lesions A single flat polyp of benign appearance was 
found in the distal sigmoid colon. Cold forceps biopsies were 
performed for histology at the distal sigmoid colon. A fungating 
mass of malignant appearance was found at the transverse colon. 
The mass caused a complete obstruction. The scope could not 
traverse the lesion and the examination was interrupted. Cold 
forceps biopsies were performed for histology at the transverse 
colon.  
.
SPECIMEN SUBMITTED: G.I. BIOPSIES (2 JARS)
DIAGNOSIS: 
Colonic mucosal biopsies, two:
A. Transverse, mass:
Adenocarcinoma.
B. Distal sigmoid, polyp:
Fragment of colonic mucosa with hyperplastic features.
.
Radiology Report ABDOMEN (SUPINE & ERECT) Study Date of ___ 
8:57 ___  
IMPRESSION: Distended loops of air-filled bowel consistent with 
ileus. Stool 
within the descending colon. Pneumoperitoneum from recent 
surgery.
