Brief Hospital Course:
A ___ yo RHW with a history of CIDP with recent exacerbation who 
received the 1st dose of a new course of IVIG therapy 2 days 
prior to admission. She presented with one day of dull, 
throbbing headache and neck stiffness. Her neurological exam was 
consistent with her previous outpatient examinations. 

The remainder of her physical exam and neurological exam were 
unremarkable. By the next morning, her meningismus resolved. 
Head CT with and without contrast was negative for venous sinus 
thrombosis and other acute intracranial processes (there was a 
concern for VST with IVIG or OCP therapy).  Her labs were 
notable for a normal serum WBC, negative serum/urine tox screen, 
normal UA. CSF analysis was consistent with meningitis, which 
was thought to be most likely aseptic due the fact that she had 
just received IVIG the previous day.  In addition, her CSF 
profile did not seem consistent with a bacterial meningitis. 
However, though she had no preceding prodrome to indicate a 
viral etiology, her CSF profile could have been consistent with 
a viral meninigitis.  As such, HSV-PCR was sent in addition to 
RPR, VDRL, Lyme titers, cryptococcal antigen, and serum/CSF ACE. 
She was on acyclovir during her hospitalization until her 
HSV-PCR came back negative.  

The patient was discharged home with follow up with Drs. ___ 
___. The following lab results were pending at discharge: 

1. RPR, VDRL
2. Lyme titers 
3. Cryptococcal antigen 
4. Serum/CSF ACE

stiffness, which began the day after the 1st dose of a new 
course of IVIg. Your physical exam, lumbar puncture results, and 
negative imaging findings were consistent with aseptic 
meningitis, which was likely due to your IVIg therapy. You 
received acyclovir while hospitalized for the possibility that 
you had Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV) meningitis. Your HSV PCR is 
negative. Your headache and neck stiffness resolved with pain 
treatment and rest. Please contact Dr. ___ in one week to 
report how you do.
