History of Present Illness:
Ms. ___ is a ___ woman with severe persistent
asthma (1 prior intubation), allergies, and depression who is
presenting with shortness of breath.

She is followed by ___ pulmonary and was last seen in ___.
She is currently on Advair and Flovent standing and
duonebs/albuterol inhaler PRN. She previously tried Xolair, but
developed a hypersensitivity reaction. Pulmonary has been 
working
to get insurance approval for Nucala - the patient reports she
now has approval, but still needs to schedule an appointment for
administration. She is also taking montelukast, zyrtec, and
Flonase for her allergies. In spite of this, she's had to take
prednisone ~twice per month for the past several months for her
asthma symptoms.

This time she reports that she had contact with a sick child a
few days ago and then developed URI symptoms (runny nose, sore
throat, and cough). She then developed shortness of breath and
wheezing typical of prior asthma exacerbations. She has been
taking her medications as prescribed and took predisone 40mg on
the day prior to presentation and on the day of presentation. 
Her
symptoms persisted and so she presented to the ED on ___.

IMAGING:

PORTABLE CXR ___:
Probable artifact mimicking a left apical pneumothorax however 
repeat exam in
the Radiology department including expiratory film is suggested 
to exclude
pneumothorax.

CXR PA/LATERAL ___:
No pneumothorax. 
Mild pulmonary edema may have increased since ___.
 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ lady w/ severe persistent asthma (1 prior intubation), 
allergies, and depression who presented with shortness of breath 
and wheezing and was found to have an acute asthma exacerbation.

#Asthma Exacerbation
#Shortness of breath
#Allergies:
She had diffuse expiratory wheezes on exam and increased work of 
breathing at rest.  She initially required 1.5L of oxygen.  
Initial ABG was unremarkable.  CXR showed no evidence of 
pneumonia.  She was afebrile throughout her hospital course.  
She was having a mildly productive cough.  She was treated with 
IV Solumedrol 80mg on ___ and then started on Prednisone 60mg 
daily on ___.  She was on scheduled duonebs Q6H plus PRN 
albuterol nebs Q2H.  She was continued on her home Flovent, 
Advair, and Montelukast.  She had been exposed to a sick child 
recently and was having some URI symptoms prior to admission, 
which may have triggered the exacerbation.  She also has 
seasonal allergies and was continued on Cetirizine.  She has an 
outpatient pulmonologist at ___ who originally wanted to start 
her on Nucala (mepolizumab), but then needed insurance approval, 
which apparently she has now, but needs a new appointment for 
this to be administered. The patient improved significantly 
while in the hospital and was saturating well on room air prior 
to discharge. She completed 5 days of steroids while in the 
hospital. She will follow up with PCP within the next 1 week.

#Hyperglycemia: She has had documented hyperglycemia with 
systemic steroids in the past, but no formal diagnosis of 
diabetes.  Her blood glucose was in the 120s-210s and controlled 
with sliding scale Humalog.  Her A1c was 6.4.

Transitional issues:
- Patient to follow up with Pulmonary for consideration of 
mepolizumab
- No changes made to home medications

continued on your home inhalers.  You were not found to have a 
pneumonia.  You will continue steroids when you leave the

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ is a ___ y/o F w/ severe persistent asthma, allergies, 
and depression, who presented with SOB, DOE, and cough with no 
consolidation on CXR in setting of recent sick contacts.
Overall picture was felt to be consistent with severe asthma 
exacerbation probably triggered by viral illness.  She required 
BIPAP for several hours in the ED.

# Asthma w/ acute exacerbation: stable/improving
# Acute respiratory acidosis: improving
# Acute hypoxic respiratory failure: improving
Presented with dyspnea and wheezing along with recent sick 
contacts, felt to be consistent with asthma exacerbation 
triggered by viral illness. CXR negative for focal infiltrate. 
She required BIPAP for several hours in the ED.
On admission her peak flows were 250, well below her baseline of 
475. She improved gradually on the medical floor with usual 
asthma exacerbation treatment including prednisone, standing & 
PRN nebs, and expectorants in addition to her home medications.
Peak flows and wheezing significantly improved with steroid 
treatment, though she still had some mild wheezing on day of 
discharge (day four of steroids). Therefore she was discharged 
on a short steroid taper (40mg on ___, 30mg on ___, 20mg 
on ___, 10mg on ___. 

# Seasonal Allergies: continued fluticasone nasal spray, 
cetirizine

# Leukocytosis: developed leukocytosis to 17, likely steroid 
effect. There was no evidence of pneumonia on CXR. Improved to 
11 at time of discharge

# Steroid-induced Hyperglycemia 
# Pre-Diabetes
HbA1c in ___ was 6.2%, repeat A1c here is 6.4%.
While hospitalized, treated with NPH and ISS.

# Depression: continued home bupropion 200mg BID, LamoTRIgine 
100 mg BID, Sertraline 50mg

> 30 minutes spent on discharge coordination and planning
