___ year about 1 month ago (he initiated it). Since that time he 
has been interested in another girl and she told him that she

current boyfriend and these mixed signals are causing a "state 
of polarizing emotions." The patient reports he has felt down

alone" and described another panic attack when he "lost control" 
and had an urge to overdose on an entire bottle of nyquil (which 
he has in his dorm room) as a suicide attempt. 
.
Patient also states that when he recently had his "waves of 
sadness" he thought "I'd let myself pull the trigger if I had a

Brief Hospital Course:
This is a ___ yo single Caucasian male student at ___ with no 
PPH or PMH who presents for several weeks of panic attacks and 
suicidality in the context of romantic breakup. Patient 
describes episodes consistent with panic disorder and also 
displays poor coping with recent romantic breakup and prospect 
of moving on from that relationship. On exam, patient was 
initially anxious and dysphoric, and had some episodes of panic 
accompanied by intrusive thoughts of death and dying.  With 
initiation of an SSRI and prn Vistaril for panic attacks, 
patient's symptoms improved significantly and he developed 
coping skills through group work and individual therapy while 
admitted. He was aligned with outpatient providers at discharge 
for continued symptomatic management, therapy, and medication.

#Legal: ___
#Safety: Patient with SI prompting admission. Patient had a few 
occasions of feeling overwhelmed by thoughts of death during 
panic attack episodes, which resolved with staff support and prn 
Vistaril. He was maintained on q15 min checks on the unit and 
did not engage in self-harm behaviors.  

#Psychiatry
Adjustment disorder with mixed anxiety and depression: Patient 
with 1 month history of panic attacks, dysphoria, and 
generalized anxiety, increasing in frequency over the past week. 
No full-blown panic attacks while on the unit, but continued 
anxiety with some intrusive thoughts of death and dying. Zoloft 
was initiated at 25 mg QHS and uptitrated to 50 mg QHS at the 
time of discharge in order to address his anxiety. Vistaril 25 
mg TID prn anxiety attacks was also initiated, which the patient 
reported improved his panic symptoms significantly.  He denied 
any thoughts of death in the days leading up to discharge.

#Medical
Hypokalemia - Potassium was 3.1 upon admission, unknown etiology 
as patient reports normal diet and asymptomatic.  He was 
replenished with PO supplement, and repeat value was 4.1.  
Patient was observed to be eating well on the unit with no 
disordered behaviors.

Risk Assessment
The patient carries some risk factors for self-harm/suicidality, 
including acute psychosocial stressors, lack of previous 
outpatient providers, family history of mental illness, male 
gender, and age. Protective factors include help-seeking 
behavior, lack of substance use, no chronic mental illness, 
family support, no prior self-harm or suicide attempts, and 
stable housing. The patient's suicidal thoughts lie in a 
specific context of romantic relationship discord as well as 
panic attacks resulting from enmeshment in such situations. The 
patient displayed no self-harm behaviors on the unit, and 
thoughts of death and dying were rapidly abated by emotional 
support and prn medication. Upon discharge, the patient denied 
suicidality and was able to cite numerous coping skills obtained 
during admission in order to properly deal with such thoughts in 
the future.
