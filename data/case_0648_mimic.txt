Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ is a ___ year old man with hydrocephalus since 
infancy after traumatic birth with VPS placed at three months 
and revised at ___ years who presented to ED for evaluation of 
headaches. 

Mr. ___ has had a headache since ___. He had a normal 
neurological examination, with no papilledema, and NCHCT with 
relatively stable ventriculomegaly. He was evaluated by 
neurology and neurosurgery who did not feel that his headaches 
were because of hydrocephalus or shunt malfunction. Benign 
headache management was recommended. 

Mr. ___ presented ___, again, because of headache. Mr. 
___ was evaluated by neurology, neurosurgery, and 
ophthalmology and the conclusion was again that he had a benign 
headache. Mr. ___ was offered symptomatic headache 
management, but declined. He was taking prednisone for his 
headache, but it has not been of benefit and might be 
contributing to anxiety and tachycardia. Mr. ___ expressed 
generalized weakness in addition to headache. We have 
recommended that he present to his primary physician to further 
discuss this as he or she will be more able to generate broad 
differential.

Discharge Instructions:
Mr. ___, 

You were admitted to the neurology service for further 
assessment of your headaches.  Your case was discussed amongst 
neurology, ophthalmology, and neurosurgical physicians.  We have 
concluded that we do not believe that your headache is because 
of either increased or decreased pressure in your head.  We 
think that you have a benign headache that can be treated as an 
outpatient.  We offered you medication for headache management, 
but you did not feel strongly about starting a new medication at 
this time.  We would recommend that you no longer continue to 
take the prednisone for your headaches as it may have been 
contributing to some anxiety and racing of the heart.  

We feel strongly that you should see your primary physician to 
discuss your generalized weakness.  We do not think that your 
weakness is from a primary neurologic condition and feel that a 
primary physician would be better ___ to more fully study for 
this.  We also recommend that you follow up with your 
neurologist and report to him or her that the prednisone was not 
of benefit and potentially caused side effects.  If you are 
interested in daily headache management medications he or she 
should be able to further help you. 

Thank you for allowing us to care for you, 
___  Neurology

Brief Hospital Course:
#Papilledema with hydrocephalus
The patient was admitted to the Neuro ICU under Neurosurgery 
with Hydrocephalus after ophthalmology noted papilledema on 
exam. A right frontal EVD was placed under conscious sedation 
that was opened up at 15mm above the tragus. After the EVD was 
placed his headache improved. He underwent a repeat NCHCT on 
___ that showed stable hydrocephalus, so his drain was dropped 
and opened at 10. At that time, his vision remained blurry 
although his headache had improved. He was evaluated by 
Ophthalmology who recommended sending CSF to rule out 
meningitis, a MRI Brain and Orbit with MPRAGE to rule out venous 
sinus thrombosis. MRI brain and Orbit with MPRAGE showed 
continued papilledema and was negative for VST. On ___, CSF 
cultures showed 3+ PMNLs but no growth on final culture. The 
patient was transferred from the Neuro ICU to the ___ on ___. 
On ___, the patient remained neurologically stable on 
examination. On ___, the patient remained neurologically 
stable. EVD was intermittently clamped for high output, however 
was re-opened due to visual changes. On ___, the patient 
remained neurologically stable on examination. Ophthamology was 
consulted to re-evaluate for papilledema. A CSF sample was sent 
for gram stain and culture, which showed no growth. In the 
afternoon, the patient suffered a sudden onset HA and underwent 
a STAT CT head which was stable. On ___, the patient remained 
neurologically stable on examination. He stated that his 
headache and dizziness were markedly improved. The patient 
underwent a pre-op work-up in anticipation for surgical 
placement of a VP shunt the next day. On ___, EVD was clamped 
in anticipation of VP shunt placement in the afternoon. Patient 
did not tolerate EVD being clamped, ICPs sustained in ___. EVD 
was re-opened at 25. Repeat CT ___ was grossly stable. Patient 
underwent left frontal VP shunt placement on ___. Please see 
separate operative report in OMR by Dr. ___ further 
details. On POD 1, patient was reporting adequate pain control, 
ambulating independently, and voiding without issue. Patient was 
medically cleared for discharge home on ___ and discharged 
home in stable condition with plan for close ___ on 
___.

Brief Hospital Course:
___ year old male with a history of hydrocephalus s/p shunt 
placement as a small child who presets with headaches, 
dizziness, and generalized weakness and imaging concerning for 
ventriculomegaly.

#Ventriculomegaly
The patient was admitted to Neurosurgery for further work-up. He 
underwent a repeat CT of the head, which showed unchanged 
ventriculomegaly. He also underwent MR of the head which again 
showed unchanged ventriculomegaly, but no evidence of any acute 
intracranial etiology of his symptoms. Neurology was initially 
consulted and recommended headache management. Ophthalmology was 
consulted to evaluate for papilledema associated with acute 
intracranial hypertension, but there was no evidence of 
papilledema on their evaluation. The patient continued to be 
monitored and remained neurologically stable.

#Tachycardia
The patient was found to be tachycardic to the 150s-160s with 
mobilization. He was asymptomatic during this, and his heart 
rate returned to baseline once he was back at rest. His labs 
were checked and were within expected limits. An EKG was also 
obtained and was unremarkable. Medicine was consulted, and 
recommended fluid repletion, so the patient was given a 1L 
normal saline bolus.  The patient improved slightly but still 
into sinus tachycardia with ambulation.  Seen by medicine and 
cleared for home with holter monitor and f/u with cardiology.

#Disposition
The patient mobilized with the nurse and was determined to be 
independent with mobilization.
