STUDIES:  

CTA: 

1. No pulmonary embolism or acute cardiopulmonary process. 

2. Enlarged and heterogeneous right thyroid lobe as seen on 
prior
examination, for which further evaluation can be performed with 
a thyroidultrasound on a nonemergent basis if clinically 
indicated. 

3. Mild intrahepatic biliary ductal dilation, at least involving 
the lefthepatic lobe, not fully imaged. Correlate with LFTs, if 
further evaluation is warranted ultrasound or MRCP can be 
considered.

4. simple fluid collection in the left paraesophageal region 

 
EKG:  sinus tachy, left axis WNL, PRWP, non specific lateral T 
wave faltening. Not significantly changed from prior. 

There is normal compression and augmentation of the comon

tightness and shortness of breath. She underwent chest CTA, MI 
rule out and laryngoscopy which did not demonstrate any obvious 
cause for her symptoms. She did endorse her symptoms often 
happening at night and sometimes accomapanied by nocturnal 
cough. She had stopped taking omeprazol about 2 months prior.  
She was restarted on omperazol at 20mg BID. On morning of 
discharge she reported that her throat tightness has resolved 
overnight and she feels much better. She denies fevers, chills, 
cough, SOB, CP or any other complaints currently. I also spoke 
to her thoracic surgeon Dr. ___ who reviewed her 
CTA and does not think her symptoms and imaging are concerning 
for a any post operative complication or recurrence.

to hemocncentration. Now resolved.

after resolution of relative hemoconcentration with fluids. 
- simple fluid collection in the left paraesophageal region - 
likely post surgical. No concern per thoracic surgery.  
- Enlarged and heterogeneous right thyroid lobe: unchanged from 
prior per radiology. Past FNA benign. 
- intrahepatic biliary ductal dilation - likely normal changes 
post CCY, no clinical or lab correlate for cholestasis. 
- ? CHF: given chronic symptoms of DOE, orthopnea, PND, periph 
edema. 
- peripheral edema: ___ amlodipin? CHF? ___ neg for DVT's. 
- DMII - metformin was held after IV contrast which is likely 
why she has been having hyperglycemia in the 200's over the past 
day. Restarted on day of discharge
