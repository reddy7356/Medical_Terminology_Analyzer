STUDIES:
___ EKG: SR at 81. LAD and LVH. <1 mm ST/J point elevations 
in V1-V3, and aVR. TWI in I, II, aVL, V5-V6. No prior for 
comparison

___ CXR: The lungs are clear without consolidation or edema. 
There is mild aortic tortuosity. The cardiac silhouette is top 
normal for size. No 
effusion or pneumothorax is noted. No displaced fractures are 
evident. 
  
IMPRESSION: No acute pulmonary process. 

___ CT HEAD: There is no evidence of intracranial hemorrhage, 
edema, shift of normally midline structures, hydrocephalus, or 
acute large vascular territorial infarction. Prominence of the 
ventricles and sulci are consistent with global cerebral 
atrophy, greater than expected given the ___ age.  
Periventricular white matter hypodensities are consistent with 
mild chronic small vessel ischemic disease. The visualized 
portions of the paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are well 
aerated. The imaged osseous structures are unremarkable. 
  
IMPRESSION: 
1. No acute intracranial process. 
2. Global cerebral atrophy is more than expected given the 
___ age. 

___ CXR: As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung 
volumes have 
slightly decreased. As a consequence, there is minimal crowding 
of vascular structures at the lung bases. However, no focal 
parenchymal opacity suggesting pneumonia is detected. No pleural 
effusions. Borderline size of the cardiac silhouette without 
evidence of pulmonary edema.

K-4.0 Cl-99 HCO3-26 AnGap-___ year old M found unresponsive at T stop, admitted with EtOH 
level of 381, ___, and closing anion gap.  
.  
# Acute Renal Failure: 
Patient presented with an elevated creatinine to 2.4. Per 
primary provider at ___ baseline 
is 1.1. ___ was pre-renal in etiology and improved to baseline 
with fluid rehydration. 
.  
# Alcohol Dependence with Acute Intoxication: 
Pt's unresponsiveness was initially due to alcohol intoxication. 
He had no focal signs on neuro exam and CT head was negative. 
Acute intoxication resolved and patient was monitored for 
withdrawal on CIWA scale with valium. He denied history of 
seizure but did report past history of "bad dreams" and DTs in 
___. He was given thiamine 100 mg PO daily and a multivitamin. 
He did not show any signs of withdrawal during hospitalization 
with CIWA scores consistently below 5. 
.  
# Anion Gap Acidosis: 
Patient presented with elevated anion gap and decreased bicarb. 
This was attributed to alcoholic/fasting ketoacidosis with 
possible contribution from mild lactic acidosis in the setting 
of dehydration. He had no ketonuria or serum ketones, but these 
levels were checked after patient was given fluids and glucose 
on arrival to ED. Serum osmolality was checked and could be 
accounted for by his alcohol level. Gap closed with fluid 
rehydration. 
.
# Benign Hypertension: 
Patient developed hypertension with systolics in the 200s. He 
was asymptomatic. Baseline is unclear, but he reports ususally 
130s-150s. He was continued on his home metoprolol and his 
lisinopril was uptitrated from 20 to 40 mg daily. He was also 
started on nifedipine with significant improvement in his blood 
pressures- he was discharged on this medication. His blood 
pressure control should be followed up in the outpatient 
setting.  
.  
# CAD Native Vessel: 
___ NP at ___, patient has a h/o 
CAD s/p anteroseptal NSTEMI in ___. No baseline EKG in our 
system, but EKG here showed NSR 81, LAD, less than ___levations in aVR, V1 and V2 and TWI I, II, V4-V6. Non specific 
changes and patient asymptomatic while in house. Did note some 
chest pain a week prior to admission while drinking alcohol. Was 
ruled out for acute MI and continued on aspirin, metoprolol, 
lisinopril, and simvastatin. Patient is a poor historian, but 
given remote chest pain, may benefit from outpatient stress 
test.
.  
# Leukocytosis:
 Patient w/ no localizing symptoms for infection, CXR, U/A 
normal. Likely a stress response as trended down on repeat 
testing.
.
# Right rib pain: 
On discharge, patient complained of mild R rib pain that was 
reproducible on palpation. Patient was not hypoxic, or 
tachycardic, and had an ambulatory O2 sat between 94 and 97%. 
CXR showed no evidence of rib fractures. Likely musculoskeletal 
in nature, but if persists, should be further evaluated.

IMAGING
BILATERAL HAND XRAYS
IMPRESSION: 
  
1. No acute fracture or dislocation.   
2. Slightly suboptimal assessment of the right hand due to 
patient 
positioning. Findings suggestive of gout involving the distal 
aspects of the ___ and ___ metacarpals. 

BILATERAL FOOT XRAYS
IMPRESSION: 
  
No acute fracture or dislocation.  Findings concerning for gouty 
arthritis involving the ___ left MTP joint. 

CXR
IMPRESSION: 
  
No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ man with h/o gout, HTN, CAD, MGUS, alcohol abuse who 
presents with gout, also found to have anemia, transaminitis, 
and very short episode of likely afib, resolved.

1) Gout: Inflammatory markers quite elevated, with CRP greater 
than assay.  Rheumatology was consulted and performed 
arthrocentesis on left knee, which showed negatively 
birefringent crystals, WBC count ___, consistent with gout.  He 
was started on prednisone 60mg daily x5 days, as well as 
tramadol for pain control.  Colchicine avoided due to 
transaminitis.  Improved symptomatically, and discharged with 
prednisone taper: 40mg ___, 20mg ___, 10mg ___, 
then stop.  

2) Transaminitis: Mild, AST>ALT in 2:1 pattern, trending down on 
discharge.  Given patient's history, suspect alcoholic liver 
disease, although upon contacting patient's primary care 
provider, did not have elevated LFTs in the past.  Perhaps we 
could be seeing a transaminitis in the setting of ongoing total 
body inflammation. Liver function with INR normal, plts normal. 
Deferred workup of this, especially since trending down. Would 
repeat LFTs in outpt follow-up and consider further work-up if 
they remain elevated.

3) Anemia: Hemoglobin 8 throughout admission, though dropped 
from 11 at initial admit, was most likely hemoconcentrated 
coming in, given orthostasis and ___.  Upon review of his PCP's 
records shows that his baseline Hgb seems to be around 10.  He 
had no signs of active/overt bleeding.  Also on review of 
records, he has a listed diagnosis of MGUS, and there is some 
concern as to whether the anemia is related to this. Hemolysis 
labs were negative, with a low reticulocyte count. Therefore, 
SPEP sent and pending at time of discharge and will need to be 
followed up. Iron studies actually with high ferritin either due 
to active inflammation at this point, vs. anemia of chronic 
disease. B12 normal.  

4) Paroxysmal afib: had isolated episode of irregularly 
irregular tachycardic rhythm on ___ night of admission, which 
appeared c/w afib on EKG.  However, resolved with fluids and 
reverted to sinus rhythm on his own; maintained on telemetry 
subsequently without events and never recurred.  He was thought 
to be a poor candidate for any anticoagulation. 

5) Alcohol abuse: maintained on CIWA q4h while in ___, with 
diazepam 10mg for CIWA>10.

6) HTN: hypertensive to SBP 180s on admission; once home 
anti-hypertensives were restarted, this normalized, but with a 
few isolated systolics in the 190s.  Therefore, home nifedipine 
increased from 60mg daily to 90mg daily.  Maintained on 
lisinopril and metoprolol.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES
-Will need to have LFTs rechecked to see if downtrending.  If 
not, will need w/u with RUQ u/s, outpatient eval for 
transaminitis.
-Will need to have CBC rechecked to ensure stability
-SPEP pending at time of discharge

Discharge Instructions:
Mr. ___,

It was a pleasure taking care of you while you were admitted at 
___.  You were admitted due to joint pain from gout.  You had 
a tap of your left knee to look at the fluid in your knee, and 
this was consistent with gout.  You were started on prednisone 
to help with your inflammation and pain.  You were found to have 
anemia and mildly elevated liver enzymes, but these were stable. 
 Your blood pressure was also high, and your nifedipine (blood 
pressure medication) was increased.
