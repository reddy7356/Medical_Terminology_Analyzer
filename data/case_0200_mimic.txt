Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,  

You were hospitalized due to symptoms of right-sided body 
weakness and sensory changes resulting from an ACUTE ISCHEMIC 
STROKE, a condition in which a blood vessel providing oxygen and 
nutrients to the brain is blocked by a clot. Damage to the brain 
from being deprived of its blood supply can result in a variety 
of symptoms.  
Stroke can have many different causes, so we assessed you for 
medical conditions that might raise your risk of having stroke. 
In order to prevent future strokes, we plan to modify those risk 
factors. Your risk factors are:  
-Hypertension, Hyperlipidemia, cocaine abuse

We are changing your medications as follows:  
Start: Aspirin 81mg daily, atorvastatin 40mg daily and 
lisinopril 5 mg daily

Please take your other medications as prescribed.  
Please followup with Neurology and your primary care physician 
as listed below.  
If you experience any of the symptoms below, please seek 
emergency medical attention by calling Emergency Medical 
Services (dialing 911). In particular, since stroke can recur, 
please pay attention to the sudden onset and persistence of 
these symptoms:  
- sudden partial or complete loss of vision  
- sudden loss of the ability to speak words from your mouth  
- sudden loss of the ability to understand others speaking to 
you  
- sudden weakness of one side of the body

- sudden loss of sensation of one side of the body  
- sudden difficulty pronouncing words (slurring of speech)
