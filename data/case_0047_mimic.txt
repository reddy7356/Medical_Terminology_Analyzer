The patient was sent to ___ given her open book pelvic fracture, 
however, no active bleed was identified.  On HD#2, an MRI spine 
was performed which demonstrated T4-T5 instability, ligamentous 
disruption, spinal syrinx, which spine reported was operative.  
On ___ the plan was to take the patient to the OR with 
thoracics for an anterior approach to the spine.  Unfortunately, 
the patient had poor oxygenating, PEEP requirements rising and 
so surgery was deferred. Blood cultures at that time also began 
growing GPCs, and so Vanc/Zosyn was started. On ___, the 
patient was transfused 1 uPRBCs for Hct of 21 with appropriate 
response. On ___, it was again planned to take the patient to 
the operating room for anterior approach to repair the patients 
spine, however, once a double lumen tube was placed, the patient 
rapidly desatted to the ___ and so surgical intervention was 
once again aborted given concern for pt's tolerance of one lung 
ventilation. DLT left in place (both lumens opening in trachea) 
given concern for difficult re-intubation. Dose of decadron 
given for laryngeal edema was given and the patient was started 
on a lasix gtt and the patient was paralyzed on Roc for 2 days.  
On ___, the patient was stable enough to be taken back to the 
operating room to exhcange her double lumen tube for a 7.5 ETT 
to allow for better respiratory toilet while the patient is more 
stable for her T-spine surgery.  On ___, the patient went to 
the operating room for an anterior approach to her T ___ right thoracotamy approach.  On ___, the patient 
went back to the OR for a posterior approach to her spine 
fusion.  On ___, an IVF filter was placed given her exptected 
prolonged immobility.  And on ___, she went to the OR with 
ortho for a pelvic ring ORIF and R ___ tibia ORIF.  
Pre-operatively, her Hct was 19, so she received 2uPRBCs.  Over 
the prior several days, the patient had been having daily 
fevers, and had been placed on ceftriaxone emperically.  Post-op 
on ___, the patients antibiotic regimen was broadened to 
Vanc/Cefepime for her continued fevers.  On ___, the patient 
was extubated without any issues. She continued to improve over 
the next few days in the ICU. A CXR on ___ noted an improving 
left retrocardiac opacification and apparent resolution of a 
small left pleural effusion. Antibiotics were completed for HCAP 
treatment (ended ___. She failed a formal speech and swallow 
evaluation on that day ___ and so was continued NPO with tube 
feeds with plans to reassess later in the week. She did require 
some high ___ oxygen and non-invasive BiPap on ___ and ___ for 
improved breathing/oxygenation. At that point the screening 
process for an LTAC and rehab was begun. She was also started on 
Seroquel at that time for agitation especially at night. 

She was transferred to the floor on ___ for continued care and 
management. Seroquel was increased due to continued agitation at 
night. Low dose Coumadin was begun for treatment of long-term 
immobilization and hx of multiple major fractures. Foley was 
d/c'd on ___. She continued to have episodes of agitation 
overnight, and was started on Xanax on ___. She also failed to 
void and foley was replaced on ___ the patient was 
doing well and was ready to be discharged to rehabilitation 
facility.
