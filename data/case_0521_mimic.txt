REPORTS

 ECG Study Date of ___  8:37:58 ___ 

Sinus rhythm with A-V conduction delay. Non-specific 
intraventricular 
conduction delay of the left bundle-branch block type. Possible 
inferior 
myocardial infarction, age indeterminate. Poor R wave 
progression. 
Non-specific ST-T wave abnormalities. No previous tracing 
available for 
comparison.  

CHEST (PA & LAT) Study Date of ___ 6:33 ___ 

IMPRESSION: 
  
Apparently elevated right hemidiaphragm with configuration 
raising possibility of subpulmonic effusion.  Lateral decubitus 
films could help clarify.  Right basilar opacity could be due to 
adjacent atelectasis noting that infection is not excluded.  
Cardiomegaly. 
  
___ ECHOCARDIOGRAPHY REPORT
  TTE (Complete) Done ___ at 2:23:07 ___      FINAL 

Normal left ventricular cavity size and right ventricular cavity 
dilation with regional biventricular systolic dysfunction (LVEF 
= 40 %) c/w CAD/chronic infarction ___ RCA distribution). 
Pulmonary artery hypertension. Mild mitral regurgitation. 
 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ year old male hx. DM, CAD, CHF, schizoaffective disorder 
presenting with findings of CHF exacerbation and hypertensive 
urgency/emergency. 

# Acute on chronic systolic CHF exacerbation:  Patient appeared 
to be in significant right sided heart failure with bilateral ___ 
edema, elevated BNP.  Patient was diuresed effectively with 40 
mg IV lasix daily.  He was negative 1.5-2.0 liters daily with 
this regimen.  Patient's most recent PCP was contacted for 
records which revealed patient has had problems with anasarca 
and noncompliance with CHF regimen for quite some time.  Most 
recent ECHO from PCP showed ischemic cardiomyopathy with EF 25%. 
 Patient underwent repeat ECHO this admission which showed EF 
40% with biventricular systolic dysfunction.  CHF service was 
consulted who recommended patient be discharged on oral 
torsemide 20 mg daily.  His lisinopril was continued.  
Metoprolol was switched to carvedilol as below.  He has followup 
with his PCP to continue to address his CHF regimen, and would 
benefit from close monitoring and referral to cardiology.

# Hypertensive urgency/emergency: patient largely asymptomatic 
on admission but could qualified as hypertensive emergency given 
pulmonary effusion, signs of CHF on exam, elevated BNP.  
Patient's pressures came down with administration of home 
antihypertensive regimen of metoprolol and lisinopril as well as 
lasix.  Amlodipine 5 mg daily was added from hospital day ___ 
but pressures remained elevated in the 150-170s systolic range.  
Out of concern for worsening his cardiac function, decision was 
made to not increase amlodipine but to substitute carvedilol for 
metoprolol for its added antihypertensive properites.   
Pressures remained elevated but improved on day of discharge in 
the 150s-170s range.  Patient would benefit from close 
monitoring of renal function and titration of antyhypertensive 
regimen going forward.

# CAD s/p inferior MI: patient had evidence of old inferior MI 
on EKG, no signs or symptoms to suggest ACS on admission, 
troponin was neg x1.  As per self report, patient had MI in ___ 
and said he did not receive stents.  Most recent PCP also could 
not confirm if he was stented or not.  His metoprolol was 
switched to carvedilol as above and he was continued on aspirin, 
lisinopril, and simvastatin.  

# DM: held oral regimen and placed on ISS in house, ___ remained 
well controlled.

to address CHF and antihypertensive regimen.  Most recent PCP
