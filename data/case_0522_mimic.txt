Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None
 
History of Present Illness:
Mr. ___ is a ___ male with past psychiatric history of major 
depressive disorder with psychotic features, past medical 
history of hypercholesterolemia, hypertension, atrial 
fibrillation, mild cognitive impairment, and mild ___ 
who is a patient of Dr. ___ and is admitted for 
recurrence of psychosis.

Per Dr. ___ dated ___, Mr. ___ was doing 
well until about a week ago when he became "increasingly 
preoccupied with having run into someone
from ___ School who knew him when he was sick. 
Since then he has become increasingly paranoid and delusional. 
He has become convinced that people are talking about him and 
that he owes money to ___. He has looked 
into investments for money to repay ___ and has concealed 
this
from his wife." 

Upon presentation to the unit, Mr. ___ reports that for the 
last 6 days his mood has been "very upset and nervous." He says 
that about 6 days ago, he "imagined" that he stole from ___ 
___ while he worked there in the past and he has 
been concerned that the people may come to arrest him for this. 
He reports he has gone as far as to look for money to repay 
___.
He is not sure whether this is real or not but regardless, is 
very upset about this. He has also been hearing voices which he 
is unsure are real. He cannot recall what they say exactly but 
reports that they say "disparaging" things to him. He now feels 
extremely guilty about past sexual transgressions and abusing an 
expense account to support these transgressions in the remote 
past. No visual hallucinations. He has had "fleeting" SI which 
is ego-dystonic. No plan or intent. He is adamant that he enjoys 
his life. He loves his wife and children dearly and describes 
his 4 grandchildren as a "joy" but the delusions have 
preoccupied him to the extent that he has difficulty interacting 
with them. He thinks that the delusions preceded the mood 
symptoms but is not
sure. He reports that his current symptoms are very similar to 
those he experienced in ___ when he attempted suicide by 
overdosing on narcotics and walking into ___ and 
doesn't want things to get "that bad" this time. He is fearful 
of ECT but cannot describe why and is unsure if it helped him in 
the past.

Brief Hospital Course:
==== PSYCHIATRIC =====
# Major Depressive Disorder with psychotic features:  Mr. ___ 
has a history of depression since ___ with notable shame and 
guilt. In the hospital his nortriptyline was increased to 75mg 
QHS and he was started on olanzapine 2.5mg that was subsequently 
increased to 5mg. During his admission the patient noted 
fleeting visual hallucinations which most consistently included 
"little green men" which he sees in "clouds" in the room. He 
denied any auditory hallucinations throughout his admission. 
Throughout the week of ___ he developed increasing insight into 
his delusions of owing money to ___ by 
stating he likely does not owe them any money and he was "acting 
crazy." His paranoia decreased in this time as well and he noted 
that focus and concentrating on these paranoid thoughts helped 
to resolve these concerns as he knew they were not based in 
reality. He was similarly able to "ignore" the visual 
hallucinations and stated that he knew these were not based in 
reality and was relatively unconcerned by their appearance.

Mr. ___ noted that much of his anxiety was rooted in concern 
regarding his wife's health. A few weeks prior to admission she 
was diagnosed with a recurrence of breast cancer which had been 
in remission for over ___ years. Prior to this admission she 
underwent two surgeries to treat this cancer and underwent a 
mammography on ___ to investigate if further treatment was 
necessary. Leading up to this test, Mr. ___ himself was very 
anxious and he believes this anxiety exacerbated his symptoms. 
His anxiety noticeably decreased after he learned that his 
wife's test showed successful treatment.

Mr. ___ was discharged to a Partial Hospitalization Program 
which was encouraged by his outpatient psychiatrist. The patient 
is uncertain if this will benefit him but he is willing to try.

The following medications were prescribed after discharge:
- Nortriptyline 75mg QHS (increased from 50mg on ___
- Olanzapine 5mg (started on this admission. Initially started 
with 2.5mg which was then uptitrated after patient found to 
tolerate medication).

# Insomnia: The patient at home took 0.5-1mg of Lorazepam 
nightly to
help with sleep. Patient was trialed on Trazodone 25mg and slept 
very
well and was transitioned off lorazepam due to fall concern with 
that medication.  Mr. ___ had nights where he did not sleep 
well during admission (especially the night prior to his wife's 
aforementioned test). Mr. ___ wife expressed concern that 
the patient sleep walks and is very agitated during sleep.
- Recommend outpatient sleep study to assess agitation during 
sleep.
- Patient responded well to Trazodone 25mg QHS PRN, occasionally 
needing an additional dose.

===GENERAL MEDICAL ISSUES====
___: continued carbidopa-levodopa ___ TID.  Spoke 
with outpatient neurologist regarding his ___ and 
driving who recommended outpatient driving evaluation. 

#Hyperlipidemia: Continued atorvastatin 10 mg daily. 

#Hypertension: On admission blood pressure readings of 180/100 
with 160-170/80-100 on repeat.  Monitored closely and continued 
lisinopril 20 mg daily. His blood pressure returned to within 
acceptable limits shortly after admission and remained there 
until discharge.

#Atrial fibrillation: Continued bisprolol 10 mg daily and 
dabigatran 150 mg BID

#Trigeminal neuralgia: Prescribed carbamazepine 200 mg po PRN. 
Patient notes that he
does not like to take this medication due to side effect of 
drowsiness.

#Normocytic anemia:  Admission labwork revealed Hgb 12.5 with 
MCV 96. No recent baseline for comparison. Differential includes 
early iron deficiency anemia, occult bleed, or anemia of chronic 
disease perhaps resultant from his conditions. No intervention 
performed during this admission given relatively mild drop in 
hemoglobin.

IMAGING AND DIAGNOSTICS
=======================
NCHCT (___): Similar appearance of the large posterior left 
frontal lobe intraparenchymal hemorrhage, with associated 
vasogenic edema, new intraventricular extension likely 
attributable to redistribution.  No new or enlarging hemorrhage. 


CTA Head and Neck (___):   
1. Unchanged large left frontoparietal intraparenchymal 
hemorrhage with 
intraventricular extension with rim of surrounding vasogenic 
edema.  No

MRI Brain (___): 
Left parietal intraparenchymal hematoma without associated 
abnormal 
enhancement.  However, follow-up examination should be obtained 
after 
resolution of hematoma to exclude possibility of underlying 
lesion. 

NCHCT (___):
1.  Overall, stable appearance of the known left frontotemporal 
intraparenchymal hematoma with slight interval increase in 
associated 
vasogenic edema since prior exam in ___. 
2.  Previously seen small intraventricular hemorrhages are also 
similar compared to prior exam. 
3.  No evidence of infarction or new hemorrhage.

NCHCT (___):
Unchanged left intraparenchymal hematoma and adjacent edema.  
Interval 
redistribution of the intraventricular hemorrhage.  No evidence 
of new infarct or hemorrhage.  

CXR (___):
Severe left lower lobe atelectasis unchanged.  Small if any left 
pleural 
effusion.  No pneumothorax.  Heart size top-normal. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ is a ___ year-old man with ___ disease, 
trigeminal neuralgia, and atrial fibrillation on Pradaxa; who 
was transferred from ___ for a large left temporoparietal 
intraparenchymal hemorrhage without midline shift. At ___ he 
was given tranexamic acid and K-Centra, then Praxbind at ___ 
to reverse his anticoagulation. On exam he had significant 
speech compromise and a dense right neglect and plegia. He was 
admitted to the neuro ICU, then step-down unit for further 
monitoring. A PEG was placed on ___. 

#L IPH with IVH extension: Patient had repeat imaging which 
showed stable bleed. MRI brain did not show evidence of 
microbleeds in other locations. In the ICU, patient was 
hypertensive and needed a  nicardipine drip for blood pressure 
control. His PO medications for HTN and rate control were 
started after an NG tube (and later PEG)was placed. Pradaxa was 
held given his large bleed. Patient was started on SQ heparin 
and aspirin. We discontinued anticoagulation and discussed these 
risks with the family (risk of bleed vs risk of embolism given 
a-fib), and they agreed to discontinue. 
- He should have a follow-up MRI in 6 months for interval 
resolution of blood and to evaluate for an underlying etiology 
for his bleed (vascular malformation, neoplasm, etc). 
- He will follow-up with stroke neurology at ___ with Dr. 
___. 
- Continue aspirin 81mg DAILY. Discontinue other anticoagulation 
indefinitely. 

___ Disease: Patient was started on his home Sinemet 
dose of ___ x 1 tab TID and this was increased to 1.5 tabs 
TID due to significant rigidity. He did not have a noticeable 
response to the increased dose, but we considered that his 
continuous tube feeds (with added protein) may be interfering 
with his absorption of the drug -- which is a known interaction 
-- so we changed his tube feeds to 14 hour overnight cycles. 
- Avoid feeding until 1 hour after Sinemet dose AND do not dose 
Sinemet until 2 hours after feeds have stopped. 
- He will follow-up with his neurologist, Dr. ___.  

#Atrial fibrillation with RVR: In the ICU, he required an 
increase of his home metoprolol dosing due to rapid heart rate. 
He consistently had rates in the 110s-130s, and we further 
uptitrated his metoprolol to 62.5mg Q6H, which improved his 
vitals to BPs 110-149/69-85, and HRs ___ on his final day of 
admission. Due to those HR decreased below 50, we reduced the 
dose to 50mg Q6H prior to discharge. 

#Mild leukocytosis: His WBC fluctuated during this admission, 
ranging from 8.9-13.2. He was not febrile, urine was negative on 
3 occasions, did not have diarrhea, and CXR did not suggest any 
infectious process. This may have been a stress response, 
atelectasis, or an NMS-like syndrome resulting from irregular 
absorption of Sinemet causing a withdrawal-like syndrome. 
- Intermittently monitor CBC. Chest physiotherapy and incentive 
spirometry when able. 

#Left pleural effusion and atelectasis: As part of the 
infectious work-up above, CXR revealed left-sided pleural 
effusion. We considered thoracentesis and consulted pulmonary 
medicine. They performed bedside ultrasound and determined the 
effusion was due to atelectasis. 
- Chest physiotherapy and incentive spirometry as above. 

#Agitation: His hospital course was notable for agitation at 
times and he pulled out IVs. He was given Zyprexa as this was 
his home medication, though it did not help. We discontinued 
Zyprexa due to its exacerbation of ___ and switched to 
Seroquel PRN which has less of an interaction. He has, in 
general, not been agitated save for on ___ occasions earlier in 
the admission. 

#Insomnia: We discontinued his home amitriptyline due to 
significant sedation. 

#Trigeminal Neuralgia: Initially he was in significant pain and 
his Tegretol was resumed. Family described that he becomes 
significantly sedated on Tegretol and was only taking it as 
needed for pain at home, so we made this medication PRN.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,
  
You were hospitalized due to symptoms of right-sided face, arm, 
and leg weakness and inability to speak resulting from an ACUTE 
HEMORRHAGIC STROKE, a condition where a blood vessel providing 
oxygen and nutrients to the brain breaks and bleeds into the 
brain. The brain is the part of your body that controls and 
directs all the other parts of your body, so damage to the brain 
from being deprived of its blood supply can result in a variety 
of symptoms.
  
Stroke can have many different causes, so we assessed you for 
medical conditions that might raise your risk of having stroke. 
In order to prevent future strokes, we plan to modify those risk 
factors. Your risk factors are:  
-Atrial fibrillation
-High blood pressure

We are changing your medications as follows:  
- STOP Pradaxa, amitriptyline, atorvastatin, olanzapine, 
trazodone
- INCREASE lisinopril to 20mg DAILY, Sinemet ___ to 1.5 tabs 
TID, metoprolol to 50mg Q6H (from 25mg BID). 
- START aspirin 81mg DAILY. 
Please take your other medications as prescribed.  
Please followup with Neurology and your primary care physician 
as listed below.  
If you experience any of the symptoms below, please seek 
emergency medical attention by calling Emergency Medical 
Services (dialing 911). In particular, since stroke can recur, 
please pay attention to the sudden onset and persistence of 
these symptoms:  
- Sudden partial or complete loss of vision  
- Sudden loss of the ability to speak words from your mouth  
- Sudden loss of the ability to understand others speaking to 
you  
- Sudden weakness of one side of the body  
- Sudden drooping of one side of the face  
- Sudden loss of sensation of one side of the body  

It was a pleasure taking care of you.

Sincerely,
___ Neurology
 
Followup Instructions:
