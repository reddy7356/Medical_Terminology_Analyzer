Dual-chamber pacemaker implantation ___

 
History of Present Illness:
Ms. ___ is a ___ year-old woman with history of HTN, CAD s/p 2
stents on bisoprolol, and CKD who presented to the ED with
dizziness, found to have bradycardia and hypotension admitted to
the CCU for pressor requirement. 

Patient reports she has been feeling slightly dizzy
intermittently for the past month. This worsened over the past
week and has been associated with new dyspnea on exertion and
PND. She denies any chest pain/pressure, n/v, or orthopnea. Her
dizziness became significantly worse today such that she was
unsteady on her feet. She also endorsed some numbness in her
feet. She called EMS who found her to be bradycardic with a HR 
of
28, SBP in the ___. She got atropine 0.5 mg x1 and IV fluid ___
cc bolus. 

She denies any recent changes to her medications or new
medications. She denies any changes in her life that correspond
with development of dizziness a month ago. She manages her own
medications and denies any difficulty taking them or accidental
overdose. She also notes intermittent burning epigastric pain,
worst with eating. 

She does have history of a "mini-heart attack" (?NSTEMI) s/p 2
stents in the ___ ___ years ago. Her family reports
that she had bradycardia during that time as well, but she also
had significant chest pain. Her current presentation does not
feel similar to her presentation at that time.

She has otherwise been well, and denies any fevers, chills,
n/v/d.  
 
In the ED,  

- Initial vitals were: 98.1 38 114/38 18 98% RA 
- Exam notable for: Not recorded 
- Labs notable for: Platelets 116, K 6.6, BUN 30, Cr 1.7, pH
7.32, CO2 48
- Studies notable for:  CXR - Right base opacity could be due to
combination of pleural effusion and atelectasis, but underlying
consolidation is not excluded. Cardiomegaly. Moderate pulmonary
vascular congestion. Right paratracheal opacity without
indentation on the trachea may be due to prominent vasculature,
but underlying lymphadenopathy is not excluded given lack of
priors for comparison.
- Patient was given: Atropine 0.5mg x 1, glucagon 1mg, Dopamine
gtt, Calcium gluconate, insulin/dextrose, 500cc NS,
- Cardiology was consulted and recommended:  
 - empiric glucagon for BB reversal
 - agree with dopa (block above the node with narrow escape)
 - reverse electrolyte abnormalities
 - ICU admission for pressor requirement, BB will need to 
washout
and electrolyte derangements will need to be reversed before we
can consider primary conduction disease. 
 
On arrival to the CCU, her dizziness has resolved. She feels 
well
and denies chest pain, palpitations, dyspnea, abdominal pain,
n/v/d, subjective fevers/chills. Endorses constipation.

======================== 
Ms. ___ is a ___ year-old woman with history of hypertension, 
CAD s/p 2 stents, and CKD who presented with dizziness, found to 
have hypotension and bradycardia felt secondary to sick sinus 
syndrome. She required atropine in the field and in the 
emergency department. She was started on dopamine and admitted 
to the CCU, now status post permanent pacemaker placement on 
___. 

#CORONARIES: History of 2 stents in the ___, 
details unknown 
#PUMP: LVEF 55-60% (___)
#RHYTHM: sinus rhythm 

ACUTE ISSUES: 
======================== 
# Sick sinus syndrome:
Patient presented with one month of worsening dizziness, 
initially found to have a junctional rhythm with rates in ___ 
on EMS evaluation. She received atropine in the field and in the 
ED, as well as glucagon in the ED (there was a concern for a 
beta blocker toxicity, but this was later disproven on further 
history). EKGs were without evidence of ischemia and troponin 
was negative. She was started on a dopamine drip and admitted to 
the CCU. Following correction of hyperkalemia and keeping her 
off a beta blocker, she remained dependent on dopamine with 
ongoing evidence of sinus node dysfunction. She had permanent 
pacemaker placed on ___. Weaned off dopamine gtt. Home 
bisoprolol for history of CAD restarted at discharge. 

# Hypotension: 
Hypotension on admission was felt secondary to bradycardia. She 
was kept on a dopamine drip as above. Her hypotension resolved 
after pacemaker implanted. Her home enalapril was held at 
discharge due to borderline hyperkalemia and she remained 
normotensive. 

# Suspected ___ on CKD: 
Cr. 1.7 on admission (unknown baseline), likely secondary to 
poor renal perfusion in the setting of hypotension. Her Cr 
improved with IV fluids and dopamine drip. Per report, she has 
new diagnosis of CKD and is being worked up at ___. Discharge Cr 
1.2. 

# Hyperkalemia: 
Hyperkalemia on admission was felt secondary to ___ on CKD and 
enalapril. Her K improved with holding home enalapril and 
resolution of ___. 

# Thrombocytopenia:
Platelets in 130s since ___ per PCP ___. Patient may 
benefit from further workup as an outpatient. 

# GERD:
Continued omeprazole.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: 
======================== 
DISCHARGE WEIGHT: 73.6 kg
[] Patient has device clinic follow-up on ___ at 9:40 AM for 
pacemaker 
[] Enalapril held at discharge for borderline hyperkalemia and 
normotension. Consider restarting if potassium continues to 
normalize. 
[] Consider outpatient workup for thrombocytopenia. 
[] Right paratracheal opacity without indentation on the trachea 
may be due to prominent vasculature, but underlying 
lymphadenopathy is not excluded given lack of priors for 
comparison. Recommend outpatient CXR follow-up.
