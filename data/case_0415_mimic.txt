      Reported to and read back by ___ (___)
6:30AM
      ___. 

Imaging:
CT Chest (staging)
FINDINGS:  
  
The right axilla and supraclavicular station are obscured by 
contrast 
artifact.  Left axillary lymph nodes are numerous and some are 
enlarged, 
ranging in diameter up to 10 by 18 mm, 03:15.  Right hilar nodes 
are numerous and some are borderline enlarged as well.  There 
are no enlarged 
supraclavicular nodes. Anasarca in the anterior chest wall 
extends into both axillae. 
  
There are no discrete soft tissue lesions elsewhere in the 
imaged chest wall suspicious for malignancy. Gynecomastia is 
mild and symmetric. Findings below the diaphragm will be 
reported separately. 
  
There is no thyroid mass.  Atherosclerotic calcification is not 
evident. Aorta and pulmonary arteries and cardiac chambers are 
normal size.  Pericardial effusion is small, nonhemorrhagic and 
there is is only minimal right pleural effusion, despite 
ascites. 
  
The only enlarged intrathoracic nodes are in the right 
diaphragmatic station laterally, 10 mm, 03:45 and juxta cardiac, 
11 mm, 03:43 and in the esophageal hiatus, 10 mm, 03:46. By 
virtue of their location, these nodes reflect subdiaphragmatic 
pathology and could be either reactive or malignant. 
  
There are no lung lesions suspicious for metastasis. Subpleural 
atelectasis and subsegmental atelectasis, both primarily at the 
lung bases are not due to bronchial obstruction. Bronchial tree 
is patent to subsegmental levels. There are no bone lesions in 
the chest cage suspicious for malignancy or infection. 
  
IMPRESSION:    
No pulmonary metastases. 

CT ___
IMPRESSION:
1. 3.8 x 4.9 cm rim enhancing lobulated fluid collection in 
segment 7 of the
liver containing foci of gas, consistent with liver abscess.
2. Large ascites, increased compared to previous studies, with 
peritoneal
enhancement consistent with malignant and/or inflammatory 
change. Increase in
omental caking consistent with omental metastatic disease.
3. Increase in size of an ill-defined hilar mass traversed by 
the metallic
common bile duct stents, consistent with cholangiocarcinoma, 
with increased
size of associated lymphadenopathy.
4. Small bilateral pleural effusions, slightly increased. 
Bibasilar
atelectasis.
5. Pericardial effusion and diffuse anasarca.

___
A plastic stent placed in the biliary duct was found in the 
major papilla. This was removed with snare.  Evidence of a 
previous sphincterotomy was noted in the major papilla. 
Cannulation of the biliary duct was successful and deep with a 
sphincterotome using a free-hand technique.Contrast medium was 
injected resulting in complete opacification. 
A long irregular stricture that was 20 mm long was seen at the 
common hepatic duct and upper third of the common bile duct. 
There was mild post-obstructive dilation of the right 
intrahepatic duct. 
No opacification of the left hepatic system with contrast 
initially. After few attempts we managed to advanced the 
guidewire into the left hepatic system using an angled wire 
followed by injection of contrast medium. Mild dilation of the 
left intrahepatics was noted on cholangiogram.   
Both right and left main hepatic ducts were dilated successfully 
using a ___ Fr Soehendra stent retriever over the existing right 
and left intrahepatic guidewires.
Two 8cm x 8mm Uncovered-WallFlex Biliary metal stents (REF 
___ were placed successfully across the 
stricture into the right and left main hepatic ducts.
Brisk drainage of bile and contrast from the biliary tree was 
noted endoscopically and fluoroscopically.  

CT ___
FINDINGS:  
  
LOWER CHEST: Bilateral pleural effusions have improved from ___, 
resolved on the right and slightly smaller on the left with 
adjacent 
compressive atelectasis. Linear atelectasis is seen at the left 
lung base and 
the lingula. Small pericardial effusion is unchanged. 
  
ABDOMEN: 
  
HEPATOBILIARY:  The liver demonstrates homogenous attenuation 
throughout.  A 
drainage catheter in the hepatic segment VII is identified with 
significant 
interval improvement of the intrahepatic abscess, previously 4.4 
x 2.8cm, now 
2.4 x 1.5cm. Two metallic common bile duct stents are in place 
with associated 
small pneumobilia, stable from the prior study.  The 
infiltrative mass in the 
porta hepatis, extending into segment IVB/V, consistent with 
known patient's 
known cholangiocarcinoma, is unchanged with stable 
lymphadenopathy about the 
celiac axis. Attenuation of the main portal vein (04:27) is 
unchanged. The 
common hepatic artery remains encased by tumor. The gallbladder 
is not 
visualized. 
  
SPLEEN:  The spleen shows normal size and attenuation 
throughout, without 
evidence of focal lesions.  A calcification within the spleen is 
unchanged, 
likely a granuloma. 
  
PANCREAS: Main pancreatic duct is not dilated.  The pancreas is 
atrophic. 
  
ADRENALS:  The right and left adrenal glands are normal. 
  
URINARY: The kidneys enhance symmetrically and excrete contrast 
promptly 
without hydronephrosis. 
  
GASTROINTESTINAL:  The visualized loops of small and large bowel 
are not 
obstructed. 
  
MESENTERY AND RETROPERITONEUM: Lymphadenopathy about the celiac 
axis and porta 
hepatis is unchanged. A 9.5 x 4.7 cm omental mass in the left 
hemi abdomen 
(04:41) was previously 9.6 x 4.3 cm, unchanged. Large 
intra-abdominal ascites 
with peritoneal thickening and enhancement is compatible with 
malignant and/or 
inflammatory change. There is no free intra-abdominal air. 
  
VASCULAR:  There is no abdominal aortic aneurysm.  There is no 
calcium burden 
in the abdominal aorta and great abdominal arteries.  The main 
portal vein is 
markedly attenuated at the porta hepatis, unchanged. The splenic 
vein and SMV 
are patent. 
  
BONES: No bone finding suspicious for infection or malignancy is 
seen. 
  
IMPRESSION:  
  
1.  Significant interval decrease of segment VII intrahepatic 
abscess.  The 
patient is afebrile with resolution of leukocytosis. The 
drainage catheter was 
removed at the bedside when patient came for subsequent 
paracentesis.  He 
tolerated the removal well without immediate issues. 
  
2.   Otherwise, no change in known hilar cholangiocarcinoma with 
associated 
lymphadenopathy and omental caking. 
  
3.  Large intra-abdominal ascites with peritoneal enhancement, 
compatible with 
malignant and/or inflammatory change. 
  
___ US liver with drain placement
FINDINGS:  
  
Targeted ultrasound of the right hepatic lobe demonstrates an 
approximate 5.0 
x 2.7 cm heterogeneous collection near the right dome 
corresponding to area of 
abscess on prior CT and ultrasound guided drainage. Echogenic 
material within 
this area may represents catheter pigtail and/or air. 
  
IMPRESSION:  
  
Decrease in size of right hepatic dome collection as described 
above. 
Echogenic material within the collection may represent catheter 
and/or air.  
At time of scanning, approximately 1 mL of pus was aspirated 
from the drain. 
  
___ 10:28 am ABSCESS      Source: liver. 

   GRAM STAIN (Final ___: 
      4+   (>10 per 1000X FIELD):   POLYMORPHONUCLEAR 
LEUKOCYTES. 
      NO MICROORGANISMS SEEN. 

   FLUID CULTURE (Final ___: 
      Reported to and read back by ___ ___ ___ 
10:20AM. 
      ___ ALBICANS. 
         Isolated from broth media only, INDICATING VERY LOW 
NUMBERS OF
         ORGANISMS.  Fluconazole IS SENSITIVE . 
         sensitivity testing performed by ___. 
         This test has not been FDA approved but has been 
verified
         following Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute 
guidelines
         by ___ Clinical 
___
         Laboratory.. 

   ANAEROBIC CULTURE (Preliminary):    NO ANAEROBES ISOLATED. 

   FUNGAL CULTURE (Preliminary):    NO FUNGUS ISOLATED. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
The patient is a ___ year old male with recent diagnosis of 
choangiocarcinoma, elevated ___ who presenents with fevers, 
hyponatremia, found to have peritonitis, cholangitis, GNR 
bacteremia and subsequently developed a liver abscess. Course 
was complicated by difficult to control abdominal pain, and 
nausea and recurrent malignant ascites.

#Infection: peritonitis, gram negative bacteremia, liver abscess
Patient presented septic with blood culture positive for E Coli. 
Peritoneal fluid was also consistent with bacterial peritonitis 
complicated by omental involvement of tumor secondary to 
metastases. He was treated with 2g IV ceftriaxone and flagyl. He 
then developed increasing WBC count and underwent CT abdomen 
which revealed a liver abscess. He underwent US guided drainage 
on ___ with 25cc of pus removed. Culture showed yeast.  
Fluconazole was added.  Due to decrease in drain output, the pt 
underwent repeat CT on ___ and drain removal on ___.  
The pt will need to continue with ceftriaxone, flagyl, and 
fluconazole for at least 2 weeks post drain removal.  Infectious 
disease will follow the pt and determine if longer antibiotics 
should be given. 

#Malignant Ascites
Presented with significant recurrent malignant ascites in 
addition to secondary peritonitis. His ascites was managed with 
intermittent large volume paracentesis. He received two doses of 
albumin on day 1 and 3 of treatment for peritonints.  He was 
followed by hepatology and we discussed placement of a drain to 
manage ascites. Given current infections, hepatology did not 
recommend drain placement. Also felt there was no role for 
diuretics. The patient will continue 2/x weekly large volume 
paracentesis.  Due to the pt living so far from the ___ 
center and its branches, the GI MD who has seen the pt in the 
past was contacted about managing the outpt paracentesis. 
___ that he would indeed manage this and that the 
pt should contact his office to set it up. 

#Cholangiocarcinoma: The patent was seen by heme/onc while 
hospitalized. The patient can begin treatment of his cancer when 
he has finished his antibiotic course. He patient will follow up 
with Dr. ___ for care.

#Pain
This was controlled with a fentanyl patch and oral liquid 
morphine as needed.

#Nausea with vomiting
The patent had significant pain and nausea with vomiting 
preventing ability to tolerate much by mouth. He was followed 
closely by palliative care who helped with symptom management.  
This was best controlled by keeping down the pt's ascites.

#Hyponatremia
Present throughout the admission. due to hypovlemia low albumin 
state and liver disease.  Pt was asymptomatic. It was felt that 
attempts to give IVF or significantly alter the pt's diet would 
not be very beneficial.

#DM type 1 x ___ years: 
On Lantus as outpatient.  The pt preferred to manage his blood 
sugars independtly. 

#IBD s/p colectomy with duodenitis and pouchitis: 
Per notes was on Budesonide,which was not continued on recent 
admission. Discussed with GI and felt not to contribute to 
recent presentation. Budesonide was not continued.

# Hypothyroidism: 
Levothyroxine 175mcg daily

Disposition:
The pt was strongly recommended by his care providers and his 
PCP to not return directly to home but rather to tranfer to an 
LTAC or SNF.  Despite our attempts to explain this to the 
patient and explain it was likely the best possible way to 
prevent further significant complications the pt was not 
willing.  The pt was d/ced to home with home care.

hepatic artery. Appearance is suspicious for cholangiocarcinoma. 
More definitive diagnosis might be achieved with tissue sampling 
via endoscopic ultrasound. 
2. No intrahepatic biliary dilatation with CBD stent in place. 
3. Large volume ascites. 
4. Evidence of prior colectomy with small bowel anastomosis in 
the right lower quadrant. 
    
 
Brief Hospital Course:
This is a ___ old gentleman with hx of IBD presenting with 
ongoing abdominal pain over months. Issues summarized by problem 
below.  

#Abdominal pain, ongoing: Most likely of hepatobiliary etiology. 
Pt with ongoing pain and weight loss for several months.  He has 
had a work-up at two outside hospitals, including a recent ERCP 
with findings of presumed PSC, s/p stent placement after 
presenting with biliary obstruction.  At the OSH, his bilirubin 
was down to normal after stent placement.  He was subsequently 
referred to ___ for ongoing work-up of this pain; however ERCP 
on the first day was deferred given severity of pain.  CT 
abd/pelvis was obtained which demonstrated large volume ascites 
and a hilar mass at the porta hepatis encasing the vasculature, 
concerning for malignancy.  He underwent an ERCP with brushings 
of a stricture and the prior stent was replaced.  Cytology was 
still PENDING upon discharge.  He was seen by the ___ 
surgical service and plans were made for follow-up in the 
___ clinic on ___, ___.  In 
regards to his pain, he initially required IV dilaudid as he 
wasn't able to take po; this was transitioned to oral dilaudid 
as oral oxycodone was not effective.  Consideration should be 
given to a long-acting pain medication should his pain continue 
to be a significant issue - this was not done in-house as the 
patient was determined to leave on ___ and was not on a 
long-acting oral agent during his stay.  His labs on the day of 
discharge were notable for a rising white count and rising 
bilirubin.  The patient was asymptomatic but counseled 
extensively regarding our concerns - he elected to still leave 
the hospital on ___ and will get follow-up labs with his 
outside GI on ___.  He will complete his 5-day course of cipro 
that was started after ERCP.   

#Ascites: There was a noted lesion in the hepatic hilum on CT 
imaging causing narrowing of portal vein which was concerning 
for causing his ascites. Liver did not appear cirrhotic on 
imaging. He underwent U/S with dopplers which showed no 
thrombosis.  Diagnostic paracentesis was done ___ with SAAG of 
<1.1 less concerning for cirrhotic disease but rather 
malignacy/peritoneal carcinamotsis.  He underwent a therapeutic 
para on ___ of 4.7 liters.  He was started on spironolactine 
50 mg twice daily to see if this would help with the ascites.  
Lasix was not started given ongoing issues with hydration 
in-house and the risk of dehydration at home.  His labs on the 
day of discharge were concerning for worsening dehydration as 
well as mild hyperkalemia; the patient still elected to leave 
and will get labs with his outside GI MD on ___. 

#DM type 1: on lantus and humalog at home; doses of both were 
reduced initially due to NPO status and highly variable oral 
intake (patient not eating consistently most days of his 
inpatient stay).  His sugars rose to 340s on the day of 
discharge; full dose lantus and humalog were given.  His 
corrected sodium was 132 on the day of discharge.  His sugar was 
in the mid ___ prior to discharge and he will continue with his 
regimen.  He was counseled about the interaction of cipro with 
insulin and the risk of hypoglycemia. 

#IBD s/p colectomy with duodenitis and pouchitis: Was most 
currently on budesonide 9mg po daily and this was continued

#Hypothyroidism: ContinueD Levothyroxine 175mcg daily

#Elevated BP: Improved from admission. BP likely elevated due to 
pain
Patient denies hx of HTN. Was on Lisinopril in the past for 
renal protection ___ diabetes.  As his blood pressure remained 
stable between 140-150 systolic, anti-HTN were deferred, 
although he is now on spironolactone for his ascites.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,
It was a privielege caring for you here at ___. You came in 
for an ERCP procedure but had to be admitted because your belly 
pain got worse. After underhoing testing we found that you have 
a new mass in the biliary area causing some level of obstruction 
as well as most likely causing the fluid in your abdomen.  You 
underwent an ERCP with biopsies; these results are still 
pending.  You also underwent drainage of the fluid twice - first 
time with 1 liter removed, the second time with 4.7 L removed.  
There is no evidence of infection; cytology from the fluid 
though is still pending.  

You were started on Spirinolactone, a medication to help remove 
some of this fluid.  This medication can cause high potassium, 
so it is imperative you get your potassium rechecked on ___. 

You have an appointment with Dr. ___ team on ___ in the 
___ please keep this appointment.

You were started on oral dilaudid for pain control; please note 
this medication causes sleepiness and constipation.  Do not 
drink or drive while taking this medication; you are also being 
discharged on a bowel regimen to help prevent constipation.

You have been on antibiotics since the procedure to help prevent 
an infection.  This antibiotic does interact with insulin and 
can cause LOW sugars, so please monitor your sugars closely and 
frequently as you may need to decrease your insulin dose.  This 
antibiotic also rarely causes pain and rupture of the Achilles' 
tendon; if you get pain at the heels, please stop this 
medication.  You have 5 MORE doses of this medication - last 
dose on ___ evening.  Please note you need 
space the cipro and levothyroxine apart by approximately 4 hours 
given the interaction. 

Lastly, your blood work on the day of discharge was concerning 
for possible infection, dehydration, and slightly elevated 
potassium.  You were advised to stay in the hospital for an 
additional day so we could monitor your labs, give you fluids, 
and ensure these labs were not worsening (which they have done 
since ___.  you have elected to leave the hospital today and 
expressed understanding of the risks of infection, dehydration, 
and worsening potassium.  We have discussed that you will get 
these labs rechecked on ___ through your GI doctor, 
___ provided).  The ERCP team is also aware and 
also recommends you stay today. In addition, we are concerned 
about the rising liver tests - again, we recommend you stay for 
continued evaluation of this.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ is a ___ yr old man with Hx of IBD s/p colectomy and 
ileoanal pouch, type I DM, hypothyroidism and recently diagnosed 
Cholangiocarcinoma s/p CBD stent x 2 who presents for management 
of acute on chronic hyponatremia with a sodium of 114 on 
admission. 

ACTIVE ISSUES
#SEVERE HYPONATREMIA: Currently asymptomatic. This is likely 
multifactorial secondary to hypovolemia as he appears dry and is 
thirsty. In addition, it is likely that underlying liver disease 
and possible SIADH may also play a role. This was not responsive 
to NS fluid resuscitation previously. Grossly elevated TSH 
likely contributing. Ascites causing compression of renal veins 
may also be a limiting factor. Correction of his profound 
hypothyroidism is expected to contribute, however despite fluid 
restriction, the patient's sodium level has remained stable at 
the 119-120 mEq range. Continued to follow renal 
recommendations: fluid restriction 1.5L daily, concentrated 
albumin bid today, Na checked q___ - patient near baseline Na, no 
salt tabs. Low potassium diet. Managed hypothyroidism per 
endocrinology (see below). Ensure supplements tid, drained 
ascites, as below. 
- Planned goals of care discussion today, as fluid restriction 
may not be consistent with patient's desires re: treatment at 
this stage -- was decided to go home on hospice with liberalized 
fluid and PO intake. 

#RECURRENT MALIGNANT ASCITES: Notable omental caking on imaging
now requiring drainage every few days due to symptoms. PleurX 
drain placed in peritoneum yesterday by ___ which patient 
tolerated well. 3L drained yesterday.
- Drain prn patient comfort

#PAIN: better controlled with fentanyl patch, q48h.

#DM TYPE 1: On Lantus as outpatient. Dose-reduced recently due 
to poor PO intake.

#HYPOTHYROIDISM: On Levothyroxine 175mcg daily at home. In 
house, TSH 63, T4 3.9. Patient also with malnutrition. 
Hypothyroidism likely contributing to hyponatremia. 
- IV levothyroxine per Endocrine
- Appreciate further recommendations from Endocrinology

#METASTATIC CHOLANGIOCARCINOMA: currently not candidate for 
systemic
chemotherapy given poor performance status. Per prior 
documentation, consideration being given to possible palliative 
regimen (Gemcitabine + Cisplatin).
- Plan for goals of care discussion today with patient, family, 
Oncology team and Palliative care

#MALNUTRITION: Patient with ongoing weight loss, 25 pounds since 
late ___.
