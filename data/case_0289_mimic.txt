History of Present Illness:
Mr. ___ is a ___ mam with CAD S/P 2 DES to OM2 in 
___ and 1 DES to proximal LAD in ___ who 
presents with chest pain.

Onset of chest pain was the morning of admission. This woke him 
up from sleep at 0500, was mildly improved with nitroglycerin 
but still present on arrival. Pain was "sharp" and felt in the 
left lateral side of his chest and back with radiation to the 
left arm. It worsened when he pushed on his chest, but does not 
worsen with deep breaths. He reported no diaphoresis, nausea, 
vomiting, lightheadedness. He denied recent fever or URI 
symptoms. He recalled similar chest pain with his prior anginal 
episodes. He has GERD and is on pantoprazole, does stated this 
did not feel like his GERD symptoms. He called his cardiologist 
and was told to come to the hospital. Chest pain further 
improved with nitroglycerin and aspirin provided by EMS. About 2 
weeks ago, patient began having more frequent chest pain. He 
lifted and carried some things and had anginal symptoms. He took 
nitroglycerin, and it resolved. Last night, he had unloaded his 
car and again had symptoms that resolved with nitroglycerin. The 
morning of presentation, the pain woke him and didn't completely 
resolve with nitroglycerin. In general, he reports that his 
anginal symptoms occur with lifting, but doesn't usually have 
chest pain with his regular exercise (swimming and cycling). His 
angina will occasionally worsen with stress. He sleeps on ___ 
pillows, mostly related to spinal stenosis. He does not have 
shortness of breath or cough when lying down. Also related to 
his spinal stenosis, he cannot walk more than 0.2 miles without 
pain; he uses a walker when he needs to walk more than that. He 
can take care of all his ADLs/IADLs and lives at home with his 
wife. 

In the ED, initial vitals: T 94 HR 68 BP 128/72 RR 18 SaO2 100% 
on RA. Exam remarkable for regular rate and rhythm, clear lungs, 
no signs of fluid overload. EKG showed SR at rate of 66, normal 
axis, no ST or T wave changes. Labs were notable for normal WBC, 
Hgb 12.1, plt 281, INR 1.2, K 5.1, Cr 1.2, trop-T <0.01 x2. UA 
unremarkable. Patient was given: SL Nitroglycerin 0.4 mg by 
___ EMS Prehospital; SL Nitroglycerin 0.4 mg; Nitroglycerin 
gtt IV, and Morphine Sulfate 4 mg.

After arrival to the cardiology ward, the patient reported that 
pain was very mild. He had mild lightheadedness after the 
nitroglycerin drip started. He had not eaten anything since 
breakfast, last bowel movement was the morning of admission. He 
took his clopidogrel last night.
 
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: 
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of dyspnea on 
exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema, 
palpitations, recent syncope, or presyncope.  On further review 
of systems, he denied any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep 
venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of 
surgery, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red 
stools, recent fevers, chills or rigors. All of the other review 
of systems were negative.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ is a ___ mam with CAD s/p 2 overlapping 
DES to OM2 and one DES to the proximal LAD who presented with 
biomarker chest pain and was found not to have any obstructive 
CAD, suggesting musculoskeletal etiology for his discomfort.

# Left Chest pain: Patient with extensive CAD history with chest 
pain on exertion, relieved by nitroglycerin. CXR clear, EKG 
without ST changes and Tropinin-T normal x2. Presentation 
concerning for biomarker negative unstable angina, however 
coronary angiogram performed on ___ showed patent stents 
without angiographic evidence of obstructive disease. As such, 
most likely cause of patient's chest pain was muscle 
strain/costochondritis. Patient was continued on his home 
statin, ASA, clopidogrel, amlodipine, and carvedilol. Patient 
was given a lidocaine patch on discharge.

Chronic medical problems:
# Chronic back/shoulder pain: Continued home methocarbamol with 
PRN acetaminophen, baclofen.

# Hypertension: Continued home medications per above but held 
ACE-I given contrast administration and lower blood pressures on 
discharge

# Dyslipidemia: Continued home atoravastatin

# GERD: continued home pantoprazole

# Anxiety: continued home buspirone, citalopram,

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
[ ] Patient would like referral to weight clinic
[ ] Please check creatinine and potassium within 1 week to

___ CXR
Lungs are clear.  Heart size is normal.  There are degenerative

pneumothorax
is seen

___ EXERCISE STRESS AND MIBI
INTERPRETATION: This ___ year old man with BMI of 36.7 and h/o 
CAD
s/p DES to LAD in ___ was referred to the lab for evaluation 
of chest
discomfort. He exercised for 9 minutes on modified ___ 
protocol and
stopped for fatigue. The peak estimated MET capacity is 7, which
represents an average exercise tolerance for his age. No chest, 
arm,
neck or back discomfort reported. At peak exercise a 0.5-1 mm 
upsloping
ST segment depression noticed in the inferior leads and V4-V6, 
as well
as a 0.___levation in lead aVR. These IL ST segment 
changes became
horizontal during recovery before it returned to baseline by 5 
minutes
post-exercise. Rhythm was sinus with rare isolated VPBs. 
Baseline
systolic HTN with appropriate BP response to exercise and 
recovery. HR
response to exercise was slightly blunted in the presence of 
beta
blockade.
IMPRESSION : Iscehmic EKG changes in the absence of anginal 
symptoms to
the achieved workload. Average functional capacity. Nuclear 
report sent
separately.

CARDIAC PERFUSION: Normal myocardial perfusion. Calculated left 
ventricular ejection fraction is 65%.
 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ with history of CAD s/p stents to OM2 in ___ and 
positive nuclear ETT with 99% LAD s/p DES ___, hypertension, 
and dyslipidemia, who presented with presyncope and had a 
negative work-up for myocardial infarction. 

ACTIVE ISSUES: 
===============
#PRESYNCOPE 
#CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE
The patient presented after feeling chest/epigastric discomfort 
with lightheadedness, diaphoresis and nausea while walking. This 
resolved with 20 minutes of rest. He presented to the ED where 
EKG was non-concerning for ST segment changes and troponins were 
negative x3. He was admitted for a stress test and had an 
ETT-MIBI that demonstrated no anginal symptoms, and normal 
myocardial perfusion. He continued his home aspirin, 
clopidogrel, carvedilol, and atorvastatin. His home benzapril 
and furosemide were initially held with concern for 
hypotension/orthostatis, but were resumed upon discharge. 
Patient remained hemodynamically stable and did not have any 
further chest pain or presyncopal symptoms during his hospital 
stay. 

#LEUKOCYTOSIS 
He presented with an elevated WBC to 18 with >90% neutrophils. 
This resolved by the morning following admission and he had no 
signs of infection. 

CHRONIC ISSUES:
===============
#HYPERTENSION
His home amlodipine and carvedilol were continued. His home ACEi 
was initially held with concern for hypotention/orthostatis, but 
was resumed upon discharge. 

#HYPERLIPIDEMIA 
His home atorvastatin was continued. 

#GERD
His home pantoprazole was continued. 

#ANXIETY
His home buspirone and citalopram were continued. 

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES
==================
[ ] Continue to monitor patient for anginal symptoms.
