CXR: No acute cardiopulmonary disease.

Head CT: 
1. Left sided cystic encephalomalacic changes from remote large 
left middle cerebral artery territory infarct.
2. No acute major vascular territorial infarcts are noted. 
However, considering underlying chronic changes, subtle acute 
infarcts may be missed, for which MRI is a better modality.
 
Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ was admitted to the Neurology Service for further 
evaluation. She remained hemodynamically stable throughout her 
hospital course, which is outlined by problem as follows:

1) Seizures:
She was loaded with Dilantin in the ED and also started on 
Keppra. Her Dilantin level after the load was supratherapeutic. 
Given the drug-drug interactions of Dilantin and Coumadin, it 
was therefore decided to switch her from Dilantin to Keppra. The 
Keppra was therefore gradually titrated to 1000mg BID and her 
Dilantin was allowed to taper down (level 8.7 day prior to 
discharge). She tolerated the switch to Keppra well and without 
side effects, and reported no additional seizure events. Should 
she have increased seizures or concern for seizure activity, the 
Keppra can be increased to 1250mg or 1500mg PO BID as tolerated. 


2) DVT: 
In the interim, while her dilantin was trending down, the 
Coumadin was stopped and she was bridged with Lovenox. The INR 
was also followed (1.5 day prior to discharge) and she will 
needed it checked regularly as when her Coumadin is restarted.

3) Hypothyroid:
Her TSH was checked and was normal. She was therefore continued 
on her home dose of Levothyroxine. 

She is being discharged with stable R hemiparesis and aphasia 
back to assisted living with ___ services to assist in 
anticoagulation management. Her PCP's office was contacted and 
informed of her hospital course. They will see her at her home 
for follow-up and adjust her Coumadin as needed.
