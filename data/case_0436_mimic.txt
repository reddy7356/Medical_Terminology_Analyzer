Brief Hospital Course:
ICU COURSE

1) Dyspnea:  
Patient presented to ED with limited medical history and report 
of a new diagnosis of a lung mass prior to leaving AMA from St. 
___ hosptial. Was noted to have a complete opacification of 
left lung field on CXR with minimal lung markings. CT scan was 
suggested, though patient refused. Root cause of patient's more 
acute dyspnea is the pleural effusion. Patient's dyspnea 
improved greatly following removal of 400 mL fluid during 
thoracentesis. A broad differential was entertained given ___ 
year history of HIV and smoking history: left side lung mass and 
associated malignant pleural effusion, lymphoma, 
post-obstructive pneumonia and resulting parapneumonic effusion. 
This was supported somewhat by leukocytosis and bandemia of 6%. 
Empiric therapy with vancomycin and cefepime was started.  
Sputum cultures were procured, as well as fluid cell counts, 
chemistries, cytology, gram stain, and culture.  The analysis of 
the effusion was abnormal, but nondiagnostic.  Chest CT on ___ 
showed mass (BAC) that was "head-sized", invading the left 
hilus, mediastinum, bronchus and PA. Many spinal mets were 
noted.  Given the picture of Stage IV Ca, discussion with family 
and patient resulted in change to comfort measures only.  
Patient was maintained on nasal cannula and later non-rebreather 
to support oxygenation.  Sedation also helped with tachypnea, 
that seemed to worsen when patient was more alert.
.
2.)  Hyponatremia:  
Patient had Na of 129 upon admission.  Was thought to be likely 
a hypovolemic hyponatremia given patient's hypovolemia, though 
other processes could not be exluded until the patient was 
euvolemic.  The patient was treated empiraclly with volume 
replacement with subsequent checks in sodium and urine 
lytes/osms.  Resolved with volume replacement.
.
3.)  HIV:  
Patient and son reported that she has been on and off therapy 
for years, though they did not know her current disease state 
upon admission.  HIV antibodies and viral load were taken to 
assess disease state.  CD4 count of 7, not enough blood for 
viral load.  Patient was started on azithro for MAC ppx and 
bactrim for PCP ___.  These were stopped as patient transitioned 
to CMO.
.
4.)  Heroin abuse:  
Patient noted last use ___ months prior to admission.  Patient 
reported her methadone maintenance dose to be 90 mg daily. 
Attempts were made to contact ___ clinic in 
___ to confirm the dose.  Methadone was administered 
at the confirmed dose.  These were held intermittently when the 
patient seemed overly sedated.

.
Medicine Floor Course:
Patient was transferred to the floor on ___.  Upon arrival, 
she was sedated, had a respiratory rate of 44 and coarse breath 
sounds.  Given patient's CMO status, she was continued on 5L O2 
by NC, morphine drip, ativan, and scopolamine and hyoscyamine 
for oral secretions.  At 05:10 the next morning ___, house 
officer was informed of patient's death.  Exam revealed 
nonreactive pupils, no respirations or heart sounds, no 
Babinski, and no response to pain.  Family was notified.
