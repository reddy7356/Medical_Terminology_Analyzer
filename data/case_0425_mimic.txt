Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted after being found unconscious. This was likely 
related to a heroin overdose.  Because of this, your muscles 
began to break-down, releasing a number of dangerous substances 
into your blood, which injured your kidneys.  The treatment for 
this was to monitor your labs and give you a significant amount 
of fluid through the veins.

As you know, continued heroin, alcohol, tobacco, and other drug 
use is extremely dangerous to your health.  We have provided you 
with some resources to seek treatment to help with your 
addiction.  We all strongly encourage you to seek treatment to 
prevent serious consequences, that include death.

You also tested positive for hepatitis C. As we discussed, it 
will be extremely important to follow-up with the liver doctors, 
as scheduled below. There are a number of tests that are still 
pending, which makes it even more important to follow-up with 
the liver specialists.

Please know that if you continue to share needles, you run the 
risk of passing hepatitis C onto others.  You tested negative 
for HIV today, however you should know that continued IV drug 
use especially when sharing needles, puts you at a high risk of 
contracting HIV.
