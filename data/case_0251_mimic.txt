Attending: ___
 
Chief Complaint:
Weakness, fatigue, poor PO intake.
 
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None.
 
History of Present Illness:
___ with h/o metastatic colon CA to the liver and lung, not 
currently on treatment, who presents with two weeks of weakness

>> IMAGING:
===========
CT head: Multiple calcific foci are noted throughout the brain 
and without surrounding edema, most likely representing dural 
calcifications.  However, CT is low in sensitivity for 
evaluation for masses and if clinical suspicion is high, MRI is 
the recommended study of choice. 
.
RUQ U/S: Little change in comparison to prior study with 
heterogeneous echotexture of the liver consistent with known 
metastatic disease. The common bile duct remains stable at 9 mm. 

.
CTA chest:
1. Limited study due to contrast timing demonstrates no large 
central pulmonary embolus. 
2. Innumerable pulmonary metastases throughout bilateral lungs 
have increased in soft tissue density as well as in number. 
These findings are suggestive of worsening metastatic disease. 
3. The visualized portion of the upper abdomen again 
demonstrates numerous lesions throughout the liver. There is, 
however, evidence of new perihepatic small ascites suggestive of 
worsening metastatic disease. 

___
CXR
IMPRESSION:   
Diffuse pulmonary metastases.  No acute cardiopulmonary 
abnormality otherwise demonstrated. 

___ MRI ABDOMEN
IMPRESSION: 
1.  Limited examination as described above.  Innumerable 
metastatic lesions throughout all hepatic lobes appear 
progressed since ___. 
2.  Interval progression of multifocal intrahepatic biliary 
ductal dilatation which suggests a more diffuse process. 
3.  Moderate perihepatic and perisplenic ascites is also new 
since ___. 

EKGs
====
___
Sinus rhythm. Leftward axis. Left ventricular hypertrophy. 
Non-specific 
repolarization abnormalities. Compared to the previous tracing 
of ___ the findings are similar but repolarization 
abnormalities are slightly more prominent and may be related to 
left ventricular hypertrophy or ischemia. 
Rate PR QRS QT/QTc P QRS T 
93 170 94 388/445 28 -24 6 
 
___
Sinus tachycardia. Non-specific repolarization abnormalities. 
Compared to the previous tracing the rate has increased. Voltage 
criteria for left ventricular hypertrophy are no longer seen. 
Repolarization abnormalities are similar.  
Rate PR QRS QT/QTc P QRS T 
128 186 98 292/411 46 -14 81 
 
___
Sinus tachycardia. Non-specific repolarization abnormalities. 
Compared to the previous tracing the contour of ST segment 
depression is slightly changed. Clinical correlation is 
suggested.

Brief Hospital Course:
>> BRIEF HOSPITAL COURSE
========================
___ yo female with metastatic colon CA to liver and lung who 
presented to the ED with fatigue, paroxysmal SVT, hypokalemia 
and worsening hyperbilirubinemia, briefly admitted to the ICU 
with tachycardia, now transferred to floor for further 
monitoring, work up of hyperbilirubinemia, potassium repletion 
and goals of care discussions. Given her hyperbilirubinemia, the 
Hepatology team was consulted and recommended MRI, which showed 
innumerable metastases to the liver. Her clinical status 
continued to worsen due to hepatic encephalopathy, a family 
meeting was held, and she was made CMO. Her hepatic 
encephalopathy progressed, and she passed away ___.

>> ACTIVE ISSUES:
=================
#) Altered mental status in the setting of liver dysfunction: 
Mental status was steadily worsening throughout hospital course. 
Given extremely elevated bilirubin and worsening innumerable 
hepatic metastatic lesions, this is most likely due to hepatic 
encephalopathy. CBD was normal in caliber on recent ultrasound. 
Hepatology was consulted and recommended MR imaging to evaluate 
for reversible causes of hepatic dysfunction. No revsible causes 
were found (evidence of intrahepatic dilatation). She did not 
respond considerably to rifaximin or lactulose. Given her 
worsening mental status, a family meeting was held and her code 
status was changed to CMO. She continued to have worsening 
mental status as her hospital course progressed, and she passed 
away ___.

#) Metastatic colon cancer: She has metastatic disease with 
significant worsening of bilirubin in the last 2 weeks, likely 
due to progression of liver metastases. Per oncology notes, she 
is not eligible for further clinical trials but she is 
interested in pursuing further care, unclear how much she 
understands regarding her prognosis. She was taking regorafenib 
briefly as outpatient, but stopped d/t transaminitis. 
Capecitabine therapy was the only therapy she was eligible for, 
and the plan was to slowly transition her to more comfort care 
measures. She passed away ___, likely due to 'innumerable' 
hepatic lesions and worsening liver disease.
