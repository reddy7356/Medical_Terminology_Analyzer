Brief Hospital Course:
___ w/ hx of HTN/DMII, 3 vessel CAD s/p CABG (___), AV 
conduction disease s/p dual chamber PPM placement (___), who 
presents as a transfer from ___ with neck pain as 
an anginal equivalent and found to have NSTEMI. He underwent 
coronary angiography ___ demonstrating severe multivessel 
disease, including distal LAD disease after LIMA touchdown, 
occluded RCA and subtotally occluded SVG to RCA, and critical 
proximal LCx disease. Underwent successful Impella supported PCI 
of the LCx. Procedure was complicated by brief cardiogenic shock 
requiring impella with resolution. Triggered for hypotension on 
evening of PCI, likely due to anesthesia/vasoplegia, 
normotensive thereafter. Added back home medications metoprolol 
and lisinopril and imdur without issue. Rosuvastatin was started 
at low dose 5mg daily given statin intolerances in past. Day 
prior to discharge, while walking, telemetry captured him in 
atrial fibrillation w/ RBBB morphology; this was corroborated by 
detection of atrial high rate episodes on interrogation by 
electrophysiology team. He was found to be in AF much more 
frequently than prior, and started on dose-reduced apixaban.

ACUTE/ACTIVE ISSUES:
====================
# NSTEMI s/p stent to LCx ___
# CAD s/p CABG ___
Patient presented w/ neck pain and SOB, EKG appeared unchanged 
in the setting of elevated troponin concerning for anginal 
equivalent. Trops elevated and downtrending, now s/p LHc with 
severe multivessel disease, including distal LAD disease after 
LIMA touchdown, occluded RCA and subtotally occluded SVG to RCA, 
and critical proximal LCx afterwards thought to be due to 
anesthetic vasoplegia. He had recovery and was normotensive 
after. Restarted home meds with good effect. Started 
rosuvastatin 5mg without complication despite history of 
myalgias with other statins.

# CHF, new reduced EF 45-50%
Newly reduced EF noted this admission. No diuresis required as 
he autodiuresed small amount. Unknown dry weight, weight on 
discharge was 184 pounds. 

# AF
On day prior to discharge, he had periods of wide-complex 
tachycardia while having a bowel movement and later while 
walking. This was associated with awareness of increased heart 
rate but no other symptoms. He had EP evaluation and on device 
interrogation was found to have atrial fibrillation with 
aberrant conduction. He has been followed by Dr.
___ will see him day after discharge to follow up 
increased metoprolol to 75 mg daily. He was also started on 
apixaban 2.5mg BID (dose reduced for Cr 1.5, age>___, triple 
therapy with DAPT). Increase from metop tart 25 BID to metop 
succ 75 daily. 

CHRONIC/STABLE ISSUES:
======================
# Hx of AV conduction disease
# Hx of RBBB - s/p ___ Pacemaker Versa ___ ___ placement 
in ___.

# HTN - Initially held for catheterization and then resumed home 
metoprolol, lisinopril, and imdur and increased home metoprolol 
to 75mg succinate daily on discharge. 

# HLD - On admission not on a statin due to reported 
intolerance. Started rosuvastatin 5mg daily which he tolerated. 

# DMII - Per report only, not on home insulin or oral 
antiglyemics. A1C 5.8%.

# Asthma - Provided home albuterol, flovent.

# CKD - Pt admitted w/ Cr 1.4. Review of prior labs 
demonstrating Cr 1.2-1.5 for the past several years. He remained 
within his baseline. 

# GERD - Continued on home omeprazole.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES
==================
NEW/CHANGED/STOPPED MEDICATIONS
- Started apixiban 2.5mg PO BID for atrial fibrillation
- Increased home metoprolol to XL 75mg daily

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,

It was a pleasure taking care of you at the ___ 
___.

Why did you come to the hospital?
- You had neck and chest pain that wouldn't go away

What happened while you were in the hospital?
- You had heart catheterization and the cardiologists found 
extensive blockages in your vessels, including some in your 
bypass grafts.
- They were able to put a stent in your vessel called the "left 
circumflex artery"
- Your heart is relying very heavily on this vessel
- You had low blood pressures after the procedure, likely due to 
anesthesia, and they got better
- Your medications were restarted one by one to make sure you 
did well
- Your heart went into atrial fibrillation more than it used to, 
so metoprolol dosing was increased to slow the heart rate, and a 
new blood thinner apixaban was started to prevent blood clots.

What should you do once you leave the hospital?
- With the stent, you should take aspirin and plavix EVERY day. 
Do not miss any doses or the stent could clot off.
- metoprolol was increased to 75mg daily, extended release 
version that can be taken once in the morning.
- Your new medications are:
---rosuvastatin 5mg daily. Please continue to take this to help 
prevent future blockages.
---apixiban 2.5mg twice daily. This is a blood thinning 
medication to prevent the type of blood clots that can form with 
atrial fibrillation.
- If you have any trouble with your medications, let your 
Cardiologist know.
- Please take your medications as prescribed and go to your 
future appointments which are listed below.

We wish you all the best!
- Your ___ Care Team

artery) with Dr. ___. Please see operative report for further 
details. He tolerated the procedure well and was transferred to 
the CVICU intubated and sedated. He weaned off pressor support. 
He awoke neurologically intact and weaned to extubate. 
Beta-blocker/ASA/ Statin and diuresis were initiated. All lines 
and drains were discontinued per protocol. POD#1 he transferred 
to the step down unit for further monitoring. He developed afib 
and was started on amio and lopressor was incerased as 
tolerated. He had one episode of  bradycardia during his sleep 
therefore amio was lowered. He is being discharged on low dose 
amio taper in combination with lopressor. He was also started on 
coumadin for his post-op afib. His creat peaked at 1.3 where it 
still remains. He continues on low dose lasix for contined 
diuresis. He also remains hyponatremic wth a sodium of 131. He 
has been free water restricted. He will need a BMP checked in 
the next ___. He also had a rise in his WBC and was started on 
cipro for + UA but culture is pending. Physical Therapy was 
consulted for evaluation of strength and mobility. He continued 
to progress and on POD#5 he was cleared for discharge to home.
