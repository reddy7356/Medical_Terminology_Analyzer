History of Present Illness:
___ with Afib on coumadin, morbid obesity, history of PE, 
presenting with recurrent syncope.  Has had 5 episodes of 
syncope in last 24 hours. Has had increasing frequency of 
discrete episodes of symptomatic Afib that last hours and 
usually resolve spontaneously; at the time of conversion to NSR 
she feels presyncopal (these presyncopal symptoms are new over 
the last 3 months).  Two weeks ago, presyncopal symptoms were 
very severe during a conversion and had near syncope, which was 
associated with a reportedly 6 second pause on ___ monitor.  
Never truly syncopized until yesterday.  Apparently also had 
significant pause overnight (documented at either 6 or 4.5 
seconds) witnessed by EMS (strip not available to me). Also had 
Afib with rates in 140s (not clear to me if before or following 
long pause).  Historically, presyncope always preceded by Afib 
and associated with Afib termination; however, with episodes 
yesterday she is unsure if her fib terminated, as notes that she 
was still in fib when she came to again.

She was brought to ___, where she was in sinus rhythm in 
the ___.  As no telemetry beds available, transferred to ___ 
for likely PPM placement.  

She was seen by Dr. ___ on ___ (note not yet available) 
for ?PPM placement; reports this is scheduled to be done on 
___.  
 
On review of systems, notable for dyspnea, chills, urinary 
frequency, and hand tingling during episodes of Afib - otherwise 
has not had these.  Does endorse diarrhea x 4 days, nonbloody, 
controlled with immodium.  Took antibiotics a couple months ago 
for a UTI.  She denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, 
myalgias, cough, hemoptysis. She denies recent fevers, or 
rigors. He denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the 
other review of systems were negative.

dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, 
change in ankle edema.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ is a ___ year old woman with paroxysmal symptomatic 
Atrial fibrillation, morbid obesity, hypertension, who presented 
with recurrent syncope in setting of pauses during conversion 
from Afib to Normal Sinus Rhythm.

#. Rhythm/PAF/sinus pause. 
She has Afib which terminates and she then has a sinus pause 
before sinus node takes over again. On telemetry, patient 
alternated between Afib with RVR with HR in 100s to sinus 
bradycardia with HR in ___.  She did have a couple episodes of 
Afib with RVR to 140s, associated with anxiety, palpitations, 
urinary frequency, and overall discomfort; she was treated with 
an extra dose of low dose po metoprolol for these episodes which 
slowed her rate enough to convert rhythm.  On conversion from 
Afib to NSR, she had pauses associated with pre-syncopal 
symptoms. TSH normal. She had pacemaker placed ___.  She was 
given 3 doses of IV Vancomycin ___ and started on 
cephalexin 500mg Q6h x 2 days.  Warfarin had been held prior to 
procedure, and she was restarted on warfarin without heparin 
bridge. She was maintained on metoprolol which was uptritrated 
in the setting of further episodes of Afib with RVR and 
discharged to rehab on metoprolol succinate XL 100mg daily.  
This dose may be further uptitrated as needed.  Digoxin had been 
held in the setting of symptomatic sinus conversion pauses but 
was restarted upon discharge after pacemaker placement at home 
dose. 
 
#.  Diarrhea. 
Pt complained of recent diarrhea which improved on its own 
during hospitalization. She did have recent antibiotic course.  
No leukocytosis or fevers. She was continued on immodium as she 
was taking regularly at home. If diarrhea starts again, it 
should be further evaluated as outpatient.

tylenol PRN.

___

Secondary:
Sciatica

 
Discharge Condition:
Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Level of Consciousness: Alert and interactive.

Discharge Instructions:
Ms. ___, you were admitted to ___ because you were having 
episodes where you passed out, which seemed to be related to a

fibrillation to its normal rhythm. You had a pacemaker placed to

metoprolol to help prevent you from having further episodes of 
atrial fibrillation at a fast heart rate that makes you feel 
palpitations.

Changes to your medications:

2. Please START Metoprolol Succinate XL 100mg daily
