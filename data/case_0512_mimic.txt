motion are normal. There are simple atheroma in the aortic arch. 
The descending thoracic aorta is mildly dilated. There are 
simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. The aortic 
valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is 
not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve 
leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is 
seen. Dr. ___ was notified in person of the results in the 
operating room at the time of the study.

POST-BYPASS Normal biventricular systolic function. Left 
ventricular ejection fraction now 55-60%. No changes in valvular 
function. The thoracic aorta is intact after decannulation.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ is a ___ year old male with history of hypertension who 
was admitted with one year of progressive chest pressure, found 
to have diffuse three vessel disease requiring coronary artery 
bypass grafting.  He was managed medically on the floor while 
undergoing a pre-operative work-up.  On ___ he underwent a 
coronary artery bypass grafting (left anterior mammary artery to 
left anterior descending, saphenous vein graft to obtuse 
marginal and diagonal) performed by Dr. ___.  Please see the 
operative note for details.  He tolerated the procedure well and 
was transferred in critical but stable condition to the surgical 
intensive care unit.  He extubated without incident on the same 
day. On POD #1 he was transferred to the septdown unit. His 
chest tubes and temporary pacing wires were removed per 
protocol. He was started on statin, betablockers, and gently 
diuresed toward his pre-op weight. He developed a brief episode 
of post-op afib whcih was treated with IV and po amiodarone and 
he converted back to sinus rhythm. Postoperative CXR showed a 
stable left apical pneumothorax. He was evaluated by physical 
therapy and discharge to home with ___ services was recommended. 
On POD# 4 he was cleared for discharge to home in stable 
condition.
