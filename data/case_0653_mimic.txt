IMAGING:
___ CXR:
FINDINGS: 
Portable view of the chest demonstrate extensive consolidation 
of both lungs.  There is an area of lucency overlying the right 
hemidiaphragh, which likely represents an area of spared, 
aerated lung.  There is no deep sulcal sign in this area to 
suggest pneumothorax.  The cardiac silhouette is obscured.   
An endotracheal tube ends 3.2 cm above the carina.  A left 
subclavian central venous line ends in the mid to distal SVC.   
IMPRESSION: 
1.  Extensive consolidation of both lungs.  
2.  Endotracheal tube is 3.2 cm above the carina.  A left 
subclavian central venous line ends in the mid to distal SVC.  

___ HIDA SCAN:
Normal hepatobiliary scan. 

___ CHEST X-RAY:
Severe nearly global pulmonary consolidation has not improved at 
least 
radiographically since ___.  Lucency in the left mid lung 
suggests 
cavitation or pneumatocele formation.  Heart is normal size.  
Pleural 
effusions are presumed, but not substantial.  With the chin 
partially flexed, the tip of the endotracheal tube is above the 
upper margin of the clavicles, no less than 5.5 cm above the 
carina and should be advanced 2 cm for more secure positioning.  
Right jugular line ends in the mid SVC and upper enteric 
drainage tube passes into the stomach and out of view.  No 
pneumothorax. 

___ PELVIC PLAIN FILM:
No definite fracture or dislocation. If there is continued high 
clinical 
concern for an occult fracture, consider MRI. 

MICROBIOLOGY:
___ 3:35 pm Rapid Respiratory Viral Screen & Culture
      BRONCHIAL LAVAGE .

# SEVERE PNEUMONIA, RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE RESPIRATORY 
DISTRESS SYNDROME, SEPTIC SHOCK:  Multiple family members became 
ill and several were hospitalized for respiratory illness.  He 
reported myalgias, fatigue and fevers.  Chest x-ray revealed 
bilateral ground glass opacities, and PaO2/FiO2 on admission was 
65/0.5=132, he had no heart failure, thus his picture was 
consistent with acute respiratory distress syndrome.  
Respiratory viral cultures were positive for adenovirus, and 
given the severity of his symptoms, he likely bacterial 
superinfection.  He was maintained on ARDSnet protocol and was 
paralyzed for lung protection.  He was extubated on ___, O2 
saturation at 97% on 10L.  Currently satting well (91-93%).  ID 
recommended against cidofovir and recommended 8 day course of 
vancomycin/cefepime, which he finished on ___.  He received 
pressors (levophed and vasopressin), IV fluid resuscitation, and 
was hemodynamically stable upon discharge.

# DIARRHEA:  Developed profuse diarrhea on ___, so empirically 
started PO vancomycin for C. difficile.  Stool studies for C. 
diff revealed....

# DELIRIUM:  Though oriented and redirectable, upon extubation, 
patient was mildly confused, per wife.  Likely ICU delirium in 
the setting of severe illness, prolonged intubation, multiple 
sedating medications
 
# Acute hepatitis:  Likely related to adenovirus. Total bili 
trending down and ALT/AST stable. He had a reassuring right 
upper quadrant ultrasound and HIDA scan.

# Deconditioning: Marked muscular weakness, contributing factors 
are immobilization and myopathy from paralytics. He suffered a 
mechanical fall on ___, landing on his hip.  Plain film was 
negative for fracture.

 
# Communication: ___ (wife, RN, ___) Cell ___
