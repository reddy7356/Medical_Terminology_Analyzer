ventricular wall thickness with a normal cavity size.
There is suboptimal image quality to assess regional left 
ventricular function. Global left ventricular systolic
function is normal. Quantitative biplane left ventricular 
ejection fraction is 66 %. Left ventricular cardiac index
is normal (>2.5L/min/m2) There is no resting left ventricular 
outflow tract gradient. Normal right ventricular
cavity size with normal free wall motion. The aortic sinus 
diameter is normal. The aortic valve leaflets (?#)
appear structurally normal. There is no aortic valve stenosis. 
There is no aortic regurgitation. The mitral
leaflets appear structurally normal with no mitral valve 
prolapse. There is trivial mitral regurgitation. The
tricuspid valve leaflets appear structurally normal. There is 
physiologic tricuspid regurgitation. The estimated
pulmonary artery systolic pressure is high normal. There is no 
pericardial effusion. A left pleural effusion is

biventricular cavity sizes, and global systolic
function. No valvular pathology or pathologic flow identified. 
Normal estimated pulmonary artery systolic
pressure.

CXR ___

centrally.  The 
heart is at the upper limits of normal in size.  Bilateral 
midlung opacities appear similar, likely scarring.  Previously 
seen left retrocardiac opacity has resolved in the interim.  No 
pneumothorax is appreciated.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ is a ___ w/hx of emphysema, MAC, and spinal 
leiomyosarcoma (___) who presented for T8 vertebrectomy + 
T6-T10 ___, transferred from ___ after post-op 
course c/b orthostasis and hypoxemia

#Hypoxemia: 
#Emphysema
#Post-Radiation Lung Opacities:
#MAC:
Patient with underlying emphysema and therefore may have lower 
baseline oxygen requirements; he is known to wear 0.5L NC at 
home after weaning from last hospitalization. However, during 
his hospital course his O2 requirement increased to ___ with 
+SOB. DDx included likely post-XRT fibrotic changes vs 
organizing PNA, atelectasis ___ pain, MAC, volume overload. Pulm 
was consulted prior to transfer to medicine, thought hypoxemia 
was most related to atelectasis ___ pain/recent surgery and 
post-XRT organizing PNA vs fibrosis. Decision made to defer 
steroids for now (hx of MAC), will have outpatient Pulm f/u. MAC 
not thought to be contributing per Pulm and ID, awaiting 
sensitivities, 3x sputa were sent (2x induced). Trial of IV 
Lasix caused hypotension, likely dry, supported by positive 
orthostatics. CXR on ___ with no acute findings but notably 
showed persistent opacities. PE was also on differential with 
tachycardia and hypoxia, TTE wnl. CT-A Chest on ___ performed 
for interval changes and to r/o PE which was negative, though 
showed worsening Lg Lt pleural effusion, s/p IP 400cc 
serosanguinous fluid drained, exudative. CXR was interval 
improved. Pt felt improved afterward, will have IP outpt f/u. 
Overall, will f/u with Pulm, IP, and ID for further care.

#Orthostasis:
Thought to have been ___ poor PO intake and starting tamsulosin. 
Tamsulosin DC'd as was not prior home med, no Sx of urinary 
retention. Required intermittent IVF boluses, pt's orthostatics 
were neg prior to DC.

#Leiomyosarcoma:
Patient s/p T8 vertebrectomy and T6-10 fusion on ___. Surgery 
was unremarkable. Developed small apical Lt PTX likely ___ 
surgery that resolved. Further post-op course remarkable for 
adjusting pain meds, on gabapentin, APAP, Lido TD, Oxycodone 5mg 
q4h prn. On bowel regimen for opiates. Follows with Dr ___ 
(___) and Dr ___, is considering proton 
therapy at ___, though there are concerns from Pulm about 
worsening post-XRT lung changes if would start further 
radiation.

#Severe Malnutrition
Pt with signs of severe malnutrition. Poor appetite. Evaluated 
by Nutrition, started on Ensure supplements. Pt declined NGT for 
TFs. Was started on Marinol, uptitrated to 5mg BID. Consider 
increasing to 10mg BID at f/u.

#Normocytic Anemia: 
Consistent with chronic disease/inflammation. No signs of active 
bleeding. No pRBC transfusions required.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES
===================
-Pt with prior MAC Dx at OSH, Pulm and ID consulted, will 
follow-up outpatient with both for consideration of initiation 
of tx, awaiting sensitivities. Sent 3x acid fast sputa (2x 
induced) over admission
-Pt with likely post-XRT organizing PNA vs fibrosis per Pulm, 
will have outpatient Pulm f/u. Of note, pt is being planned for 
proton radiation therapy at ___ despite likely post-XRT changes. 
DC'd on 2L home O2, previously has been on ___ at home.
-Will have outpatient ___ and ___ follow-up for further 
leiomyosarcoma treatment. Pt's home oxycodone increased from 
q8h:prn to q4h:prn, increased gabapentin to TID from BID.
-Pt was found to have +orthostasis, improved with IVF and 
increased PO intake. Nutrition recommended NGT for TFs, pt 
declined for now, started on Marinol 5mg BID, uptitrate as 
tolerated, also given Ensures TID.
-Pt will have outpatient IP f/u after 400cc thoracentesis for Lg 
Lt pleural effusion, please f/u cytology and cultures
-Pt started on famotidine for heartburn, consider DC when no 
longer needed

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr ___,

You were admitted to ___ after you came in for spine surgery. 
Unfortunately, you developed worsening low oxygen levels while 
here. The infectious disease and pulmonary teams assisted us 
with your case due to your history of MAC infection. The 
pulmonologists thought that most of your breathing difficulties 
were likely due to pain from the surgery combined with 
post-radiation lung changes. The pulmonologists and infectious 
disease doctors ___ to ___ you as an outpatient in clinic. We 
also had our interventional pulmonary doctors remove some ___ 
from around your lungs. You will follow up with them in clinic 
as well. Please follow the neurosurgery recommendations from 
your surgery below. Please make sure to drink frequent ensures 
and to overall improve your nutrition.

It was a pleasure taking care of you!

sutures/staples.
•Please avoid swimming for two weeks after suture/staple 
removal.
•Call your surgeon if there are any signs of infection like
