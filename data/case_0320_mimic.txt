IMAGING

HEAD CT
Left basal ganglia and left intrathalamic hemorrhage with 
extension into the left and right lateral ventricles and new 
extension into the fourth ventricle. 

CT C-SPINE: Mild multilevel degenerative change. No acute 
fractures.

MRI/MRA BRAIN
1. Large left basal ganglia/lentiform nucleus acute hemorrhage. 
No definite evidence of an underlying AVM or mass lesion, though 
evaluation is limited due to edema and mass effect from this 
large hematoma. 
2. Multiple foci of susceptibility are seen throughout both 
cerebral 
hemispheres and cerebellum most consistent with amyloid 
angiopathy. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
Mr ___ was admitted to the surgical intensive care unit 
intubated under the neurosurgical service. 
On neurologic examination, he was unarousable even off sedation, 
with spontaneous movement of the left side, hemiparesis of the 
right side, and no withdrawal to painful stimuli throughout. 
Brainstem reflexes were intact. 
Patient remained hypertensive in the ICU requiring a Nicardipine 
gtt 24 hours after admission. His exam improved slightly on day 
2 with eye opening to nox and attempts to flex on his right to 
nox stimuli. However, this was the best his exam became, and he 
seemed to deteriorate after this. Multiple repeat head CT scans 
showed stable size of bleed, with stable intraventricular blood. 

Neurosurgery opted not to intervene and patient was transferred 
to neuro ICU service. 
An MRI/MRA was done to look for an underlying lesion or vascular 
anomoly. This showed extensive microbleeds consistent with 
amyloid angiopathy. This, combined with HTN, was the likely 
cause of this large bleed. 
ICH scale was ___, giving him a 72-97% chance of mortality 
within 30 days. 
After extensive discussion with his entire family including wife 
and children, decision was made to make him comfort measures 
only. He was extubated ___ at 9pm. 
Palliative care consult was involved. Patient expired on 
___ at 10:11 am.
