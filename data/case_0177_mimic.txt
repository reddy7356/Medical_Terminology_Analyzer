Brief Hospital Course:
OSH peritoneal cultures: negative for polys and organisms. NGTD

___ year old female with a past medical history of HTN, HLD, 
obesity s/p gastric bypass, anemia, and ESRD on peritoneal 
dialysis who presented to ___ emergency department with 
increasing weakness over the past ___s shortness 
of breath found to be profoundly orthostatic whose symptoms were 
thought to be secondary to over-dialysis.
.  
# Shortness of breath/dizziness: Upon presentation, the patient 
did not appear volume overloaded despite recent development of 
anuria. Given her long-standing history of diabetes there was 
concern that the patient's symptoms could be due to coronary 
artery disease; however, review of the patient's record shows 
that she had a recent stress test that did not show evidence of 
ischemia. An EKG did not show changes from prior, and CK-MB 
fraction was negative. Chest x-ray did not show evidence of 
volume overload or infection. She was found to be very 
orthostatic, and on ambulation, the patient desaturated to low 
___. During this episode of desaturation, the patient was 
profoundly short of breath with subjective chest palpitations 
and dizziness. With rest, the patient recovered. Patient 
underwent CTA for concern for PE as cause of symptoms which was 
negative. ECHO was notable for a hyperdynamic state concerning 
for a hypovolemic state. The patient's orthostasis and ECHO 
findings were attributed to the patient's restricted fluid 
consumption. Renal adjusted the patient's peritoneal dialysis, 
and she was also encouraged to increase her fluid consumption. 
Of note telemetry had no events. On day of discharge, with 
ambulation, the patient was less orthostatic (without symptoms) 
and did not desaturate on ambulation. The patient has follow-up 
arranged with her outpatient nephrologist regarding peritoneal 
dialysis. 
.
# End-stage renal disease on peritoneal dialysis: Secondary to 
diabetic nephropathy. Patient is pursing kidney transplant at 
___ and is followed by Dr. ___. The patient has been 
stable on peritoneal dialysis. Renal was consulted on admission 
and peritoneal dialysis was continued through the admission. 
Given the patient's extreme orthostasis, the patient's dialysis 
was adjusted per renal. Recommendations were made for the 
patient to increase consumption of fluids to prevent symptoms 
from developing. Outside hospital cultures of peritoneal fluid 
were followed during the admission as there was concern for 
peritonitis; gram stain was negative for PMNs and bacterial. 
Preliminary cultures were no growth to date. The patient did not 
receive antibiotics during her hospitalization at ___ her 
peritoneal dialysis catheter site was non-erythematous without 
purulence. 
.
# Incidental findings of pulmonary nodules on CT scan:  3mm 
nodule in right lung noted on CTPA.  However, Ms ___ is 
low-risk as she has no identifiable risk factors, so f/u imaging 
is not required.  However, if risk factors are identified, then 
12 month f/u CT scan is warranted.  
.
CHRONIC ISSUES:
# Type 2 diabetes complicated by peripheral neuropathy and 
nephropathy: Patient is on lantus and humalog as an outpatient. 
Last HgbA1c 6.8 in ___. The patinet's home lantus dose 
was continued through the admission as was a humalog sliding 
scale.  There were no events of hypoglycemia during the 
hospitalization. 
.
# Hypokalemia: Patient was supplemented with oral potassium 
chloride as needed through the admission. 
.
# Anemia: Hematocrit was trended through the admission and 
remained stable. Patient's anemia likely related to patient's 
end-stage renal disease. Patient received a dose of Epogen 
during the admission as she had missed her dose that she 
receives as an outpatient. 
.
# Hypertension: Continued home metoprolol through the admission. 

.
# Hyperlipidemia: Patient also had complaints of weakness. Given 
her use of statins, there was concern for statin-associated 
myopathy. CK was negative. Continued home Crestor through the 
admission. 
.

___ 10:55AM   ___ PTT-30.3 ___ F admitted from home for a deceased donor kidney transplant.

On ___, she underwent perfect match renal transplant. 
Surgeon was Dr. ___. Please refer to operative note 
for details. She received routine induction immunosuppression to 
include mycophenolate, 500 mg of Solu-Medrol and Simulect. At 
the end of the procedure the transplanted kidney was noted to be 
nicely pink with good pulse and thrills in the arteries. A 
double J ureteral stent and ___ drain were placed. ___ drain 
was positioned around the anastomosis and adjacent to the 
bladder anastomosis.

She was taken to the PACU post-operatively and was 
hemodynamically stable. Pain was not well controlled in the 
PACU, so she was changed from a morphine PCA to a dialuadid PCA. 
She also had several episodes of apnea without 02 desaturations, 
likely secondary to oversedation. She was transferred to the 
floor on continous O2 monitoring with a CPAP ordered for sleep. 
She was started on a clear liquid diet, which she tolerated, and 
a bowel regimen. On POD 1 she was found to be increasingly 
somnolent, her PCA lockout time was increased to 15 minutes, 
after which the patient was more alert and responsive. On POD 1 
her UOP decreased to ___. She was given a 500cc IVF bolus 
with minimal response, her foley was flushed and she immediatly 
put out 615cc of urine; her UOP increased steadily to 
100-200cc/hr by POD 2. 
Continuous O2 monitoring was discontinued on POD 2 after 
reevaluation by respiratory therapy. She was started on a 
regular diet on POD 2, given her history of IDDM, a consult was 
placed with the ___, who continued to follow 
and manage her diabetes during her hospital stay. She also began 
to experience episodes of hypertension, with systolic blood 
pressures elevated to the 180s-190s (supine). Blood pressures 
taken while the patient was seated were found to be in the 150s 
systolic. Transplant nephrology was consulted who recommeneded 
starting her on 12.5mg of PO metoprolol BID. On POD 3 she showed 
no response to PO metoprolol, with systolic blood pressures as 
high as 210s. She was given 15mg of IV metoprolol, which also 
yielded no response. After a 5mg dose of IV hydarlazine her 
systolic blood pressure decreased to the 150s systolic. On POD 4 
she was started on 5mg amlodipine and her metoprolol was 
increased to 50mg BID. IVF was discontinued. Amlodipine was 
further increased on ___ for sbp in 170-190 range. 

She was placed on the immunosuppresion protocol post-operatively 
which consisted of steroid taper, Cellcept, Prograf which was 
started on POD 1 and Simulect (intraop  and postop day 4). On 
POD 5 she completed her steroid taper, her blood pressures 
moderated, with systolic BP in the 140-160 range. At that time 
the patient was tolerating a regular diet, ambulatory and her 
pain was well controlled. On the day of discharge she and her 
husband were provided with medication teaching and were 
comfortable with administering her medication regimen at home. 

Physical therapy evaluated and recommended home with services. A 
previously scheduled Gastroenterology appointment for ___ 
was canceled and will need to be rescheduled.

Chief Complaint:
Abdominal pain, nausea/vomiting

 
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
___:  Cystoscopy, left retrograde pyelogram, left ureteral 
stent placement. Surgeon: ___, MD 

 
History of Present Illness:
This is a ___ F with ESRD on PD, DMII, HTN, HL, orthostatic 
hypotension, who presents with several days of abdominal pain, 
nausea, and vomiting. She reports that her abdomen began to feel 
tender about one week ago, but that 4 days ago the pain 
significant increased, especially with PD administration. 
Yesterday, she had severe pain with PD radiating to her back, 
and she felt that her abdomen was abnormally distended and 
'lumpy'. She has daily vomiting at baseline presumably due to 
autonomic dysfunction, but had increased nausea with vomiting 
and heaving up to 10x three days ago and ___ two days ago. 
She has also been constipated, her last BM was 5 days ago 
despite taking her daily dose of Miralax; her last BM was solid 
and almost white. She has also noted night sweats, shaking 
chills, subjective fever, anorexia, and fatigue. She denies 
chest pain, shortness of breath, headache. 

Of note, the patient is currently on 40mg Prednisone QD for 
suspected temporal arteritis; she presented in late ___ with 
temporal headache and ESR 112; subsequent temporal biopsy was 
negative. She has also recently been suffering from orthostatic 
hypotension ___ autonomic dysfunction, however she has been off 
midodrine as her BP has been recently stable while on 
prednisone. 

In the ED, her initial VS were T 97.2 HR 108 BP 129/74 RR 16 O2 
95% RA. Labs were notable for WBC 38.1, normal LFTs/lipase. KUB 
negative for obstruction. CT abd/pelvis showed an obstructing 
3mm L mid ureteric stone with mild hydronephrosis and tiny 
non-obstructing right renal stones. It showed CBD dilation to 
11mm, without masses/stones. No appendicitis or diverticulitis 
noted. Blood cultures were drawn and patient was given 2g IV 
ceftriaxone. The patient was evaluated by nephrology/dialysis 
team and started on IP Vancomycin and IP cefepime. No peritoneal 
fluid was drawn prior to antibiotics. However, the patient had a 
bag of peritoneal dialysate from from earlier on ___ which was 
sent for culture/gram stain. Finally, the patient reports some 
BRB on toilet paper after straining for attempted BM while in 
ED, however cannot find RN documentation of this. 

On the floor, the patient's nausea and abdominal pain were 
significantly improved and she was relatively comfortable. She 
denied chills, fever.

Imaging:
___
- KUB: The stomach contains an air-fluid level but does not 
appear distended.  Stool and air are seen throughout most 
portions of the colon, including the rectum.  A few air-fluid 
levels in the pelvis are probably colonic.  Although a paucity 
of small bowel gas limits assessment somewhat, no dilated loops 
of large or small bowel are seen.  There is no free air.  
Surgical clips are present along the left upper quadrant.  There 
is a catheter coiled in the pelvis, possibly for peritoneal 
dialysis.  Prominent calcified vessels are noted about the 
pancreatic head as well as the splenic artery.  Their presence 
may be associated with collateral pathways between celiac and 
superior mesenteric arterial distributions.  Mild spinal 
degenerative changes are noted with small osteophytes along the 
mid and lower portions of the lumbar spine, as well as suspected 
facet joint degenerative changes at the lumbosacral junction. 
IMPRESSION:  Few distal colonic air-fluid levels, which are 
non-specific, without findings strongly suggestive of 
obstruction.  No evidence of free air. 
- CT abd/pelvis w/o contrast:
CT CHEST:  Linear scarring is seen in the lung bases.  Trace 
peribronchovascular ground-glass opacity is seen in the right 
lower lung (2, 1), nonspecific and similar as on prior exams.  
There is also dependent atelectasis in the right base.  There is 
no pleural effusion.  The heart is normal in size.  There is 
relatively focal anterior pericardial fluid, appearance similar 
as compared to ___.  Dense multivessel coronary 
arterial calcifications are present. 
CT ABDOMEN:  Small perihepatic ascites is re-demonstrated, in 
keeping with history of peritoneal dialysis.  The gallbladder 
appears moderately distended but without definite stranding 
around it or pericholecystic fluid.  Note is made of dilated CBD 
to at least 11 mm without obvious obstructing stone or mass, 
although assessment is highly limited due to non-contrast 
technique.  This is increased as compared to prior MRI dated 
___.  A subcentimeter lesion seen in the liver on prior 
MRI is not well visualized.  The pancreas is diffusely atrophic, 
in keeping with chronic pancreatitis.  Abnormal configuration of 
pancreatic duct with cystic changes appears similar but is 
better demonstrated on prior MRCP dated ___. The left 
adrenal gland demonstrates stable thickening without nodularity. 
 The right adrenal gland appears normal.  There is a 3 mm stone 
in the mid left ureter and the left ureter is mildly dilated, 
although there is little caliber change at the site of the stone 
in the mid ureter.  Note is made of a single focus of air in the 
left renal pelvis (2, 27), which could represent air from gas 
forming organism in pyelitis, or alternatively air refluxed from 
the bladder could be considered.  There is no obstructing 
nephropathy on the right.  Multiple tiny non-obstructing stones 
are seen in the right kidney.  There is no right-sided 
hydronephrosis or hydroureter.  Small and large bowel loops are 
normal in caliber.  The appendix appears normal.  No free air or 
free fluid.  Extensive atherosclerotic disease is seen in the 
infrarenal aorta extending into the common iliac arteries 
without aneurysm. 
CT PELVIS:  At least two stones are seen in the bladder.The 
distal ureters, rectum, and prostate appear within normal 
limits.  No pelvic lymphadenopathy.  A peritoneal dialysis 
catheter is coiled in the pelvis between bowel loops.  Trace 
fluid is seen in the right hemipelvis. 
BONE WINDOW:  There is multilevel moderate thoracolumbar 
spondylosis.  There have been prior bilateral anterolateral rib 
fractures. 
IMPRESSION: 
1.  3 mm stone in the mid left ureter with upstream mild 
hydronephroureter although the degree of obstruction is 
uncertain since the ureter does not change caliber at the site 
of the stone.  Single focus of air in the left renal pelvis 
raises concern for pyelitis due gas- forming organism although 
refluxed air from the bladder could be considered since the 
bladder contains air, but this possibility would also require 
vesicoureteral reflux.  Close monitoring is advised. 
2.  Non-obstructing tiny right renal stones. 
3.  Bladder stones. 
4.  Small amount of ascites, which is anticipated in the setting 
of peritoneal dialsysis. 
5.  Diffuse atherosclerotic disease. 
6.  CBD dilatation to 12 mm without obvious obstructing mass or 
stone, 
increased since preceding MRCP dated ___.  Correlate with 
laboratory data and consider MRCP for further assessment if 
clinically indicated. 
- CXR PA/Lateral: The heart is normal in size.  The mediastinal 
and hilar contours appear unchanged.  The lungs appear clear.  
There are no pleural effusions or pneumothorax.  Mild 
degenerative changes are similar along the thoracic spine. 
IMPRESSION:  No evidence of acute disease.

___
- RUQ blood culture: Mild perihepatic ascites evident in keeping 
with history of peritoneal dialysis.  The liver is homogeneous 
in echotexture without discrete masses or lesions.  There is no 
intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation.  The common bile duct is 
dilated to 1.2 cm in maximal dimension, but tapers smoothly to a 
level of 0.8 cm in the distal aspect.  However, the most distal 
aspect at the level of the pancreas, as well as the pancreas in 
its entirety are obscured due to overlying bowel gas.  The 
gallbladder is distended, but without gallstones.  There is no 
gallbladder wall edema or hyperemia evident.  The visualized 
aspects of the right kidney are unremarkable.  Doppler 
assessment of main portal vein shows patency and hepatopetal 
flow.   
IMPRESSION:  
1. Minimal perihepatic ascites in keeping with peritoneal 
dialysis. 
2. Dilated common bile duct without intrahepatic biliary ductal 
dilatation.  Unable to evaluate common bile duct at level of 
pancreatic head. No stones in visualized aspect of CBD. No 
cholelithiasis 

___
- renal U/S: The right kidney measures 8.8 cm and is echogenic 
consistent with provided history of end-stage renal disease.  
The left kidney measures 10.0 cm. Trace perinephric fluid noted 
on the left. No evidence of hydronephrosis bilaterally.  
Multiple non-obstructing stones are identified within the left 
kidney, the largest of which is in the lower pole measuring 3 
mm.  The bladder is collapsed and not well evaluated. 
IMPRESSION: 
Smaller echogenic kidney on the right consistent with provided 
history of 
renal disease.  No hydronephrosis evident bilaterally.  Multiple 
non-obstructing stones on the left. 

Pathology:
___
- peritoneal fluid: negative for malignant cells
 
Brief Hospital Course:
This is a ___ F with ESRD on PD presenting with abdominal pain, 
nausea and vomiting, leukocytosis, and constipation, with 
obstructing L ureteral stone on CT, CVA tenderness, and 
gram-negative bacteremia, most likely consistent with 
pyelonephritis c/b ileus. 

Active issues: 
#PYELONEPHRITIS/NEPHROLITHIASIS:  The patient presented with 
fevers, chills, nausea/vomiting, malaise, leukocytosis with WBC 
to 38, along with CVA tenderness on exam and obstructing L 
ureteral stone on CT, all concerning for pyelonephritis. The 
patient was afebrile on admission but with CVA tenderness and as 
well as moderate point tenderness in the LUQ. The patient was 
originally started on IP cefepime and IP vancomycin for concern 
of PD related peritonitis, however, with ongoing CVA tenderness 
and after discussions with nephrology and urology, the cefepime 
was transitioned to IV, and on ___ the patient underwent 
cystoscopy with left retrograde pyelogram and left ureteral 
stent placement performed by Dr. ___, without 
complication. Following the procedure and with initiation of IV 
cefepime, the patient's CVA tenderness and LUQ point tenderness 
resolved. The patient remained afebrile and her WBC trended down 
over the course of her admission.  She was transitioned to 
ciprofloxacin and tolerated it well prior to discharge.  The 
plan was to leave the stent in for 1 week on Flomax prior to 
removal of stent.  Patient will need to discuss with urology 
about need of Flomax afterward given her high risk of stone 
formation given h/o gastric bypass.

# Klebsiella SEPTICEMIA: One of two blood cultures from ___ 
grew out gram-negative rods, which speciated as Klebsiella 
oxytoca, sensitive to cefepime and ciprofloxacin, thought likely 
secondary to pyelonephritis. The patient was afebrile on 
admission with stable vital signs. She had already been started 
on IV cefepime prior to the report of growth on blood culture 
and was continued on IV cefepime until 24 hours before 
discharge, at which time she was transitioned to PO 
ciprofloxacin, which she tolerated well, and will continue at 
home until ___. She was afebrile with stable vital signs at 
discharge. 

#R/O PERITONITIS: The patient presented with nausea, vomiting, 
and abdominal pain with peritoneal dialysis, as well as an 
elevated periotoneal dialysate WBC, all concerning for 
peritonitis. Peritoneal fluid culture and gram stain showed no 
organisms and AFB smear (done out of concern for TB peritonitis 
due to elevated monocytes in peritoneal fluid) was negative. The 
patient was started on IP vancomycin and IP cefepime for 
peritonitis. Her abdominal pain rapidly improved and she was 
able to continue peritoneal dialysis without any ongoing 
discomfort. In discussion with nephrology, concern for true 
infectious peritonitis was thought to be low and the patient's 
IP cefepime was transition to IV cefepime on ___, and her IP 
vancomycin was discontinued on ___. The patient remained 
afebrile and continued on peritoneal dialysis without any pain 
or discomfort, and her peritoneal dialysate fluid culture 
remained negative. She was discharged home with instructions to 
continue with good sterile technique for home PD. 

#CONSTIPATION: On presentation the patient had not had a bowel 
movement for ___ days; she takes daily miralax at home and is 
normally regular. She had passed a small amount of gas and a KUB 
on admission showed few distal colonic air-fluid levels without 
findings strongly suggestive of obstruction; though consistent 
with ileus. As constipation can interfere with the efficacy of 
peritoneal dialysis, the patient was started on an aggressive 
bowel regimen of 2L Golytely with good response. She was 
transitioned to standing Miralax and Senna without further 
constipation.   

# R/O TEMPORAL ARTERITIS: The patient had been diagnosed with 
possible temporal arteritis in late ___ after presenting 
with bitemporal headache but without jaw pain or claudication. 
She had been started on 40mg prednisone daily. In discussion 
with the outpatient rheumatologist, suspicion for true GCA was 
thought to be low after negative temporal artery biopsy and the 
risks of immunocompromise due to steroid therapy concerning in 
light of her current presentation, and the patient was started 
on a fast prednisone taper which she will finish on ___ (had 10 
mg daily reduction from 40 mg while in house, then 5 mg x 7 days 
prior to discontinuation) 

#TYPE 2 DM: The patient reported that her blood sugars had 
recently been difficult to control, most likely due to recently 
initiated prednisone therapy. She was started on her home 
insulin regimen, however, she had persistent asymptomatic  
hypoglycemia in the mornings with AM glucose levels in the 
mid-40s to low ___. She was evaluated by endocrinology from 
___ and ___ basal insulin levels were altered, while allowing 
the patient to determine her own sliding scale doses. Her blood 
sugars were mainly stable, ranging 80-150, however peaking to 
over 300 before bedtime. She was discharged on an altered 
regimen of 18U Glargine at bedtime with the plan to follow up 
with ___ closely (per patient's request to transition back to 
___
 
Chronic issues:
#AUTONOMIC DYSFUNCTION/ORTHOSTASIS: The patient has baseline 
autonomic dysfunction as a complication of her diabetes, 
however, this had not been an issue immediately prior to her 
admission because her BPs were stable while on prednisone. Her 
blood pressures were stable during admission, ranging 110s-150s, 
despite prednisone taper and she denied light-headedness or 
dizziness on standing or ambulating. 

#ESRD on PD: The patient initiated peritoneal dialysis 14 months 
ago and is oliguric/anuric, with max ___ urine/day. She was 
continued on peritoneal dialysis per the recommendations of the 
nephrology/dialysis team without complication. Her electrolytes 
were monitored and repleted as necessary. She was continued on 
her home supplements, with the exception of her EPO, which she 
normally receives every ___ and would receive after 
discharge. All medications were renally dosed.  

#DEPRESSION/ANXIETY: The patient was continued on her home 
anti-depressant and home anxiety medication. Her mood remained 
stable throughout admission. 

#CHRONIC PANCREATITIS/CBD DILATION: On non-contrast abdominal CT 
on admission, note was made of moderate gallbladder distention 
with CBD dilation to at least 11mm but without obvious 
obstructing stone or mass (though with evaluation limited by 
non-contrast technique). The patient did not complain of RUQ 
pain. A follow-up RUQ ultrasound again revealed a dilated CBD 
without intrahepatic biliary duct dilatation but with limited 
ability to evalute the CBD at the pancreatic head. The patient 
had normal LFTs and was asymptomatic, so no further workup was 
pursued during admission. However, outpatient MRCP for CBD 
dilatation should be considered.

Transitional issues: 
#FOLLOW-UP: 
-Primary care: the patient will follow up with Dr. ___ on 
___ at 11:10am.  Consider MRCP/ERCP for evaluation of CBD 
dilatation.
-Urology: the patient will follow up with Dr. ___ on ___ at 
10:00am
-Endocrinology: the patient will follow up with Dr. ___ 
at ___ on ___ at 10:00am

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___, 

You were admitted to ___ on 
___ for abdominal pain, fever, nausea, and vomiting. 

It was initially thought that you may have either an infection 
in your abdomen or an infection in your left kidney. You were 
started on antibiotics in your peritoneal dialysis fluid as well 
as intravenous antibiotics. You did not have a fever in the 
hospital and your abdominal pain rapidly improved. We found 
stones in your left kidney based on the imaging studies, and 
thought that your symptoms had been due to a kidney infection, 
so you underwent a procedure to put a stent into the left ureter 
(tube between the kidney and the bladder). Additionally, you 
were found to have bacteria growing from your blood culture and 
were continued on intravenous antibiotics to treat this. You 
were switched to oral antibiotic medicine, Ciprofloxacin, which 
you will finish taking after discharge from the hospital. 

You should continue using good sterile technique with peritoneal 
dialysis at home as you have been.  It is important to make sure 
that you have bowel movement every day, because constipation can 
interfere with your peritoneal dialysis.

We contacted your rheumatologist for the prednisone taper, 
because your pathology report showed that you do not have an 
inflammation of the artery at your temple.  Therefore, you are 
going to be gradually tapered off from the prednisone.  This has 
affected your blood sugar, and the diabetes doctors from ___ 
helped to manage your blood sugar.  You can return to see them 
after this hospitalization.

Please note the change in your medication: 
-ADDITION of ciprofloxacin 250mg every 24 hours, which you will 
take until the evening of ___
-ADDITION of Flomax (tamsulosin) 0.4 mg every night until you 
see your urologist.
-DECREASE Lantus (Glargine) to 18 units QHS
-CHANGE your sliding scale (see medication sheet for details)

ACUTE ISSUES 

# Left ___ Toe Foot Ulcer
# cellulitis 
# diabetic foot ulcer: Patient presented with left third toe 
necrosis and cellulitis
after traumatic injury (nail clipping). She had debridement and 
IV abx (vancomycin, ciprofloxacin, flagyl ___ at OSH with 
continued erythema and necrotic material. She had ABI that 
suggest multilevel PAD that will likely need re-vascularization. 
Foot exam was stable throughout hospital stay, she never met any 
SIRS or qSOFA criteria, no leukocytosis, CRP WNL, blood cultures 
were negative. She will undergo angiogram next week as 
outpatient. Until then she will continue on oral ciprofloxacin 
and Bactrim DS 1 tab BID. Her ultimate course should be 
determined after serial examination following potential 
revascularization on 
___. 

# Chest pain: Unclear etiology, appears to be longstanding per 
her report and
review of PCP notes in ___. EKGs unconcerning, stable, not 
typical pattern for angina and enzymes negative. Toponins were 
negative. Would consider additional outpatient evaluation. 

# Diabetic Nephropathy s/p Renal Transplant (___): continue 
home tacrolimus 1.5mg q12hrs (tacro trough: 4.6 on discharge) as 
well as home MMF.

CHRONIC ISSUES
# HTN/CAD: Cont metoprolol tartrate 50mg BID, losartan 25mg BID, 
consider decreasing metoprolol given bradycardia and increasing 
losartan given relatively HTN

# Cough/chronic sinusitis: Chronic cough in setting of recurrent 
sinusitis, bronchitis. Stable on admission. Continued home meds.

# Diabetes: Continued glargine and HISS with Humalog standing at 
meals.

Discharge Instructions:
Ms. ___,
It was a pleasure taking care of you at ___ 
___.  You were admitted to the hospital after a 
peripheral angiogram. We admitted you to the hospital for IV 
hydration secondary to your kidney transplant.  To do the test, 
a small puncture was made in one of your arteries.  The puncture 
site heals on its own: there are no stitches to remove.   You 
tolerated the procedure well and are now ready to be discharged 
from the hospital.   Please follow the recommendations below to 
ensure a speedy and uneventful recovery.

Peripheral Angiography
Puncture Site Care
For one week:
•Do not take a tub bath, go swimming or use a Jacuzzi or hot 
tub.
•Use only mild soap and water to gently clean the area around 
the puncture site. 
•Gently pat the puncture site dry after showering. 
•Do not use powders, lotions, or ointments in the area of the 
puncture site. 

You may remove the bandage and shower the day after the 
procedure.  You may leave the bandage off. 
You may have a small bruise around the puncture site.  This is 
normal and will go away one-two weeks. 

Activity 
For the first 48 hours: 
•Do not drive for 48 hours after the procedure
For the first week:
•Do not lift, push , pull or carry anything heavier than 10 
pounds
•Do not do any exercises or activity that causes you to hold 
your breath or bear down with abdominal muscles.   Take care not 
to put strain on your abdominal muscles when coughing, sneezing, 
or moving your bowels.

After one week:
•You may go back to all your regular activities, including 
sexual activity.  We suggest you begin your exercise program at 
half of your usual routine for the first few days.   You may 
then gradually work back to your full routine.
Medications:
Before you leave the hospital, you will be given a list of all 
the medicine you should take at home.  If a medication that you 
normally take is not on the list or a medication that you do not 
take is on the list please discuss it with the team!

Studies:
CXR (___)
PA and lateral radiographs of the chest show no evidence of 
consolidation or pneumonia.  There is no pleural effusion or 
pneumothorax.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.  
Multiple air filled loops of bowel are noted in the left upper 
quadrant.
 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ yo F with ESRD on PD, T2DM, peripheral neuropathy, autonomic 
neuropathy and orthostatic hypotension who presents from her 
PCP's office with orthostatic hypotension.

# Orthostatic hypotension: Improved in the setting of IVF 
rehydration and initiation of midodrine, fludrocortisone, and 
salt tabs. Likely secondary to a combination of autonomic 
dysfunction secondary to diabetes and dehydration secondary to 
decreased PO intake and recent diarrhea. PCP has raised concerns 
for anorexia, which could also contribute to her orthostatic 
hypotension. Another possible cause of hypotension is infection, 
although she has been afebrile, and has no localizing signs of 
infection. ___ test was within normal limits. 

# Troponinemia: No evidence of ischemia on EKG, and the patient 
was chest pain free. It is very difficult to interpret this lab 
value given the patient's renal function. However, there is 
little in her clinical picture to suggest that she has cardiac 
ischemia. 

# End-stage renal disease: Maintained on peritoneal dialysis, 
per renal recommendations. 

# Type 2 diabetes: Tightly controlled on this admission. She was 
maintained on her home insulin regimen. 

# Anemia: Crit was elevated on presentation, likely secondary to 
hemoconcentration. Work-up in the past has revealed anemia 
secondary end-stage renal disease and B12 deficiency. Per renal 
recommendations, she was given a split dose of epogen (4000 
units SC QMOWEFR). She was restarted on her home regimen of 
epogen upon discharge.

# Hyperlipidemia: Stable. She was maintained on her home dose of 
rosuvastatin.

# Anxiety: No active issues. She was maintained on her home dose 
of lorazepam.
