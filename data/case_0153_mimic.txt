during which time she was treated for bloody nephrostomy tube 
output, found to have UTI, ___, supratherapeutic INR, and LGIB.  

Please refer to Discharge ___ of ___ for details of 
her most recent hospitalizations. In brief, she was hospitalized 
at ___ in ___ and treated for recurrent 
pyelonephritis associated with her nephrostomy tubes, ___, C.

discharge. ___ presented with a Cr of 3.9 from prior value of  
2.8. LGIB characterized by one loose brown BM accompanied by  
~30cc BRBPR; thought to be due to previously noted colonic  
angioectasias in the setting of supratherapeutic INR; this did  
not recur or require pRBC transfusion. Patient went home on 
ciprofloxacin as UA was ___ for pseudomonas. However, her 
urologist discontinued this 5 days ago (6 days prior to

IMAGING
___ CXR: IMPRESSION:  
  
No change since the prior radiograph in probable small bilateral 
pleural 
effusions and bilateral hilar prominence, likely due to vascular 
congestion. 

___ CXR:  
IMPRESSION:  
  
Diffuse prominence of lung vasculature associated with bilateral 
pleural 
effusions, right greater than left and cardiomegaly reflect 
fluid overload and 
pulmonary edema. 
Likely bibasilar atelectasis. 

___ CXR: IMPRESSION:  
  
Large right pleural effusion and mild to moderate pulmonary 
edema and moderate to severe cardiomegaly are stable since ___, having worsened after ___. 
  
Dual channel dialysis catheter ends in the right atrium and 
inferior 
cavoatrial junction.  No pneumothorax. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ is an ___ w/ afib on coumadin, CKD w/ bilateral 
nephrostomy tubes p/w generalized malaise, who was treated with 
a trial of HD via tunneled line 

ACTIVE ISSUES 

#CKD: Cr 4.0 on admission unchanged from last discharge. During 
her last admission, renal ultrasound on ___ was reassuring 
against hydronephrosis. Additionally, interventional radiology 
colleagues evaluated her percutaneous nephrostomy tubes in the 
ED, and noted that the right PCN was not draining and noted 
bloody drainage around skin site. The drain was flushed, and 3 
way adapters added to both  
drains. She then underwent ___ guided bilateral PCN exchange on 
___ as the R PCN was noted to be dislodged and the L PCN 
would have been due for routine exchange shortly. During this 
admission, ___ again evaluated her, at the beside, and her 
nephrostomies were found to be intact and draining yellow urine. 
After discussion with the medicine, renal dialysis teams and the 
patient and family, it was determined that she would undergo a 
trial of hemodialysis via tunneled line.
The line was placed on ___, and she was dialyzed in the 
hospital. She was discharged with plans for continued outpatient 
dialysis. 

# Hypoxia: Patient noted to have large right-pleural effusion 
and intermittent 2L oxygen requirement. Repeat cxr on day of 
discharge showed persistent r pleural effusion, improved from 
CXR on admission, but stable from CXR several days prior to 
discharge. She was 95-98% on room air on day of discharge. 

#Staph epidermidis bacteremia: Noted during routine infectious 
work up after she presented to the ED with malaise. Repeat blood 
cultures did not grow anything; this was therefore thought to 
represent a contaminant as it grew in only one bottle. No

Brief Hospital Course:
Hospital course: Ms. ___ is a ___ w/ afib on coumadin, HTN, 
HLD, uterine CA, CKD w/ bilateral nephrostomy tubes p/w bloody 
nephrostomy tube output, found to have UTI, ___, 
supratherapeutic INR, and LGIB. UTI was treated with initially 
with cefepime, then with zosyn, transitioned to ciprofloxacin on 
discharge. ___ presented with a Cr of 3.9 from prior value of 
2.8. LGIB characterized by one loose brown BM accompanied by 
~30cc BRBPR; thought to be due to previously noted colonic 
angioectasias in the setting of supratherapeutic INR; this did 
not recur or require pRBC transfusion. 

Active issues:
#UTI/hematuria: UA with >182 WBC, RBCs, large leuk, nitrite pos, 
suggestive of UTI. Hematuria may be ___ UTI, supratherapeutic 
INR, or less likely urologic malignancy.
UTI was treated with initially with cefepime, then with zosyn, 
transitioned to ciprofloxacin on discharge. Urine culture with 
mixed flora. Supratherapeutic INR treated as below. Recommend 
outpatient follow up to assess for resolution of hematuria once 
infection is resolved. 

#LGIB: On ___, pt had loose brown BM accompanied by ~30cc BRBPR; 
thought to be ___ previously noted colonic angioectasias in the 
setting of supratherapeutic INR. This did not recur; she was 
hemodynamically stable; and Hgb was stable on recheck. 
Supratherapeutic INR treated as below.

#Leukocytosis: Pt with known UTI as above. Also with a hx of 
C.diff colitis on a prior admission. She had one loose bowel 
movement in the hospital, which did not recur and she attributed 
this to lactose intolerance. As it did not recur, a sample could 
not be sent for evaluation, but consider C.diff toxin assay if 
diarrhea recurs

#Anemia: Recent baseline Hb appears to be ___. Hbg is 8.7 on 
admission. This may be secondary to worsening renal function, 
bleeding from her nephrostomy, and LGIB as above.

#Supratherpeutic INR: Patient presenting with INR 5.7 and 
hematuria as above. She was treated with IV vitamin K in the ED. 
Warfarin was initially held, and a smaller dose of 1 mg was 
resumed prior to discharge, with plans for ___ 
clinic follow up 

___: Cr was 2.8 in ___ however, ranged up to 4.6 during 
her ___ admission. On admission, Cr of 3.9 above recent 
baseline. Likely prerenal ___ infection and concurrent volume 
depletion. Renal ultrasound reassuring against hydronephrosis; 
however, ___ evaluated her PCNs in the ED, and noted that the 
right PCN was not draining and noted bloody drainage around skin 
site. The drain was flushed, and 3 way adapters added to both 
drains. She then underwent ___ guided PCN exchange. By the time 
of discharge, Cr was 3.9. Furosemide was held with plans to 
follow up in clinic.

#Atrial fibrillation: Rate controlled and anticoagulated. 
Continued home metoprolol; managed warfarin as above

Chronic issues:
#Depression: Continued home Citalopram 10mg, BusPIRone 15 mg PO 
BID 

#Hx of gout: Continued home allopurinol

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,
It was a pleasure taking care of you at ___. You were admitted 
with bloody output from your nephrostomy tubes, and found to 
have a urinary tract infection, an elevated INR (meaning that 
your warfarin level was too high), and a bloody bowel movement.

Because your warfarin contributed to episodes of bleeding in the 
tubes and in the stool, the dose was reduced on discharge. You 
were also started on ciprofloxacin, an antibiotic for urinary 
tract infection. 

Please take all your medications as listed and follow up with 
your doctors and the ___ clinic. You should have 
your INR checked on ___.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ is an ___ y/o female with PMHx of Afib (on 
coumadin), DM2, h/o of uterine CA, CKD, and bilateral 
nephrostomy tubes who presented to the ED with altered mental 
status and found to have recurrent pyelonephritis associated 
with her nephrostomy tubes, ___ and C. difficile infection.

#C. DIFFICILE INFECTION: Returned positive on ___. Patient 
had reported diarrhea on admission but this symptom had resolved 
during hospitalization. Vancomycin PO started on ___ with 
course planned until 10 days after completion of Ciprofloxacin.

#UTI: Ms. ___ presented with increased confusion, bloody 
output from her nephrostomy tubes, nausea, and vomiting. 
Urinalysis suggestive of UTI, with no obvious signs of 
pyelonephritis on ultrasound. She had recent hospitalization for 
this same concern,  and had completed a course of Cefepime. 
Restarted Cefepime on admission here but culture returned as 
pan-sensitive Pseudomonas on ___ so transitioned to 
Ciprofloxacin PO with a planned 14-day course.

___ ON CKD: Baseline creatinine was 2.5. On admission her 
BUN/Cr was elevated to 117/4.3, likely due to current infection 
and pre-renal azotemia. Her uremia may be contributing to her 
current myoclonic jerking. 1.5L NS given during the first 24 
hours of this admission but renal function has improved today 
with Cr of 4.2. As below, lisinopril (5mg daily) and furosemide 
(160mg BID) were held.

#AFIB/SUPRATHERAPEUTIC INR: INR on admission 10.4. She had a 
reported fall the day prior to admission, CT head negative in 
the ED. She had bloody output from nephrostomy tubes, though in 
the setting of likely UTI/pyelonephritis. Received 10mg IV vit K 
in the ED. 

#BACTEREMIA: ED blood cultures returned with 1 bottle of gram 
positive cocci. Received Vancomycin X 1 on ___. Returned 
as Coagulase negative Staph on ___, suggestive of 
contaminant. Further antibiotics were deferred.

#ANEMIA: Recent baseline Hb appears to be ___. Hbg is 9.4 on 
admission. This may be secondary to worsening renal function as 
well as bleeding from her nephrostomy. Improved without 
intervention.

#DEPRESSION: Home Citalopram 10mg daily was continued. Home 
Gabapentin and Buspirone were held and restarted at discharge. 

#DM: Home Januvia was held. HISS was used while in house.

#HTN: Given relative hypotension, multiple infections and acute 
kidney injury, Lisinopril (5mg daily) and Furosemide (160mg BID) 
were held throughout this admission and at discharge. Metoprolol 
was continued.

#TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
- 14 days course of ABX for pyelo to end ___. ID f/u 
arranged.
- PO Vancomycin for C difficile to end ___ (10d after 
completion of Cipro course)
- INR rising quickly prior to discharge so held on ___ and plan 
to discharge on 1mg daily. Next INR ___. Further titration by 
___ clinic.
- Please recheck chemistry panel at close f/up.
- Ms. ___ lisinopril and furosemide were held during her 
stay and will be held at discharge. Please restart these

IMAGING:
TTE ___:
 The left atrium is elongated. No atrial septal defect is seen 
by 2D or color Doppler. The estimated right atrial pressure is 
___ mmHg. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy 
with normal cavity size. Overall left ventricular systolic 
function is low normal (LVEF 50-55%) with suggestion of relative 
basal to mid inferolateral/ lateral hypokinesis. The right 
ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with normal free wall 
contractility. The diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending 
and arch levels are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are 
mildly thickened. There is mild aortic valve stenosis (valve 
area 1.2-1.9cm2). Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The 
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is severe 
mitral annular calcification. There is mild functional mitral 
stenosis (mean gradient 5 mmHg) due to mitral annular 
calcification. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due 
to acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation may 
be significantly UNDERestimated.] Moderate to severe [3+] 
tricuspid regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid regurgitation jet 
is eccentric and may be underestimated. There is severe 
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. [In the setting of at 
least moderate to severe tricuspid regurgitation, the estimated 
pulmonary artery systolic pressure may be underestimated due to 
a very high right atrial pressure.] The end-diastolic pulmonic 
regurgitation velocity is increased suggesting pulmonary artery 
diastolic hypertension. There is a trivial/physiologic 
pericardial effusion. 

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of ___, 
left ventricular function is less vigorous. The right ventricle 
is mildly dilated with normal systolic function. The estimated 
pulmonary pressures are greater (severe pulmonary hypertension). 
Other findings are similar.  

Renal US ___:
IMPRESSION:  
Atrophic kidneys which demonstrate cortical thinning 
bilaterally. No 
perinephric fluid collection identified. Small bilateral renal 
cysts are 
incidentally noted. The left ureter is noted to be dilated 
perhaps representing ectatic proximal ureter or extrarenal 
pelvis; however, no frank hydronephrosis is visualized 
bilaterally. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
___, CKD (sIV) secondary to hypertension and diabetes, TAH-BSO 
(___) for endometrial cancer complicated by vesiculocutaneous 
fistulas s/p bilateral nephrostomy tubes (___), Afib, NIDDM, 
who presents with syncopal event, confusion, and ___. 

# SYNCOPE: Likely orthostatic in the setting of hypovolemia as 
occurred on rising to standing, and prior events have always 
been positional. Less likely vasovagal as occurred prior to 
attempting defecation. Also less likely primarily cardiogenic as 
she had a prodrome, positional circumstance. No events on 
telemetry. TTE showed mild aortic stenosis, unchanged from 
prior. Buspirone and gabapentin may predispose to 
ligtheadedness, therefore they were discontinued. The patient 
wore TEDS and was encouraged to stay hydrated.
 
# ___: Cr 4.5 from baseline 2.5-2.8 on admission. Baseline CKD 
thought due to DM/HTN. ___ be secondary to starting Bactrim DS 
QD for UTI. She also had poor PO intake and orthostasis. 
Therefore, she was treated for pre-renal etiology and given 
gentle IVF. Cr trended back to baseline. The patient also had 
tremor/myoclobus, which may have been due to gabapentin in the 
setting of ___. Lisinopril and lasix were restarted once ___ 
improved. Lasix was started at 80mg BID to prevent further 
orthostasis as the patient appeared euvolemic.

# UTI: Urine culture from ___ grew Enterobacter. Repeat urine 
cultures were contaminated. In the setting of altered mental 
status and worsening hematuria and purulent urine, therefore the 
patient was treated with an active infection. She did not have 
any evidence of pyelonephritis or perinephric abscess. She is 
s/p percutaneous nephrostomy tube exchanged. She was started on 
a 14 day course of cefepime via PICC line. She will require 
outpatient urology follow up for other options besides 
percutaneous nephrostomy.

# ENCEPHALOPATHY: Likely toxic/metabolic delirium in the setting 
of UTI, hypovolemia, possible uremia, reduced clearance of 
buspirone and gabapentin. Her mental status improved with 
cessation of these medications.

# PULMONARY HYPERTENSION: TTE reported severe pulmonary 
hypertension with 2+ mitral regurgitation.

# PANCYTOPENIA: Likely multifactorial: medication effect 
(allopurinol and bactrim), urinary tract infection, and 
age-related poor marrow reserve. Improved with treatment of 
infection and cessation of Bactrim.

# ATRIAL FIBRILLATION: The patient was rate controlled with 
metoprolol. CHADS2 = 3. INR was supratherapeutic on admission. 
Warfarin was restarted at home dose when therapeutic. INR on day 
of discharge was 3.0.

# GOUT: Allopurinol was restarted at every other day, given high 
risk for gout given CKD.

# TREMOR: Improved after stopping gabapentin and buspirone.

# ANEMIA: Continued iron.

# DM: HbA1c was 6.7%. Given goal of <8%, Januvia was held. We 
recommend close outpatient monitoring.

# DEPRESSION: She was continued on home citalopram.

# HYPERTENSION: Continued home metoprolol and lisinopril. 

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
- The patient will complete a 2 week course of cefepime (day 1 = 
___.
- Warfarin held on ___ for INR 3.0. Please recheck on ___.
- Please have the patient wear TEDS for orthostatic syncope.
- Gabapentin and buspirone were discontinued due to concern for 
side effects.
- Outpatient urology followup regarding potential alternatives 
to percutaneous nephrostomy tubes.
- HbA1c was 6.7%, therefore Januvia was held (Goal HbA1c < 8%).
- Lasix restarted at 80mg BID once ___ improved.

Dear Ms. ___,

It was a pleasure caring for you at ___. You were admitted 
with renal injury, confusion, and a urinary tract infection. 
These improved with IV fluids, antibiotics, and stopping 
Bactrim. Your percutaneous nephrostomy tubes were also changed. 
You will require a total of 2 weeks of antibiotics at home via a 
PICC line.

Two medications that may have been making you more confused and 
contributing to your passing out have been stopped (gabapentin 
and buspirone). 

We also suggest you wear thigh-high TEDS stockings to prevent 
passing out in the future.

nephrostomy tubes on coumadin for afib, DM2 who presents with 
hematuria and BRBPR after being found to have an elevated INR to 
12.3. 

She was initially thought to have hemorrhage shock, likely due 
to GU bleeding based on imaging, potentially GI bleeding (based 
on blood in her diaper, which could have come from GU or GI 
source). She was given 10mg IV vitamin K and 1u FFP, with a 
central line placed for access and vasopressors. Her vasopressor 
requirement rose during the morning of admission despite a 
relatively stable Hct; her WBC rose dramatically, however, to 
24.2, with an elevated lactate as well. Vancomycin/cefepime and 
Flagyl were started empirically, the latter for potential C. 
difficile infection given the report of diarrhea prior to 
admission. She was given fluid boluses, but continued to have 
worsening hemodynamics and pressor requirement. By morning, her 
family was at the bedside, and the decision was made not to 
further escalate care as it would not be within her goals of 
care. Family was at bedside when the patient passed from 
presumed refractory septic shock.

___
___
 
TTE:
The left atrium is moderately dilated. The right atrium is 
moderately dilated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are 
normal. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Due to 
suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality 
cannot be fully excluded. Overall left ventricular systolic 
function is normal (LVEF 70%). There is considerable 
beat-to-beat variability of the left ventricular ejection 
fraction due to an irregular rhythm/premature beats. The right 
ventricular free wall is hypertrophied. The right ventricular 
cavity is mildly dilated with borderline normal free wall 
function. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. 
There is mild aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is 
seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is 
severe mitral annular calcification. There is moderate 
thickening of the mitral valve chordae. There is mild functional 
mitral stenosis (mean gradient 5 mmHg during normal diastolic 
filling periods, but greater than 12 mmHg during short diastolic 
filling periods) due to mitral annular calcification. An 
eccentric, posteriorly directed jet of (at least) moderate (2+) 
mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the 
severity of mitral regurgitation may be significantly 
UNDERestimated.] Due to the eccentric nature of the regurgitant 
jet, its severity may be significantly underestimated (Coanda 
effect). Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen (may be 
significantly underestimated due to signal attenuation). There 
is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no 
pericardial effusion. 
 
Microbiology:
UCx x2: Negative (final)

 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ F with history of CKD and bilateral nephrostomies related 
to vesiculo-enteric fisutals s/p TAH-BSO for endometrial cancer 
now admitted with Acute Renal Failure likely pre-renal etiology. 
 
    
# Acute Renal Failure: ARF on chronic renal failure, admitted 
with Cr of 3.8 (OSH) from baseline 2.5-3.0. Elevated BUN out of 
proportion to Cr in setting of recent GI illness with poor PO 
intake suggested presentation most likely pre-renal in etiology. 
Received IVFs with improvement in Cr to baseline at time of 
discharge (2.6). UA was dirty, but in setting of bilateral 
nephrostomy tubes and negative urine culture, did not treat. 
Lisinopril, ethacrynic acid, metolazone and allopurinol were 
held on admission. These were held at discharge and she should 
follow up with her PCP within one week of discharge from rehab 
to evaluate restarting these medications. Her PCP is Dr ___ 
___ telephone ___.  
        
# Anion Gap acidosis: New anion gap of 16 on admission with 
normal pH on VBG. Likely represented uremia which improved after 
IVF rehydration with resolution in gap. Normal pH suggests 
concominant contraction alkalosis given high suspicion for 
hypovolemia. Anion gap acidosis resolved.
        
# Hyponatremia: Hypovolumic, hyponatremia given pre-renal 
azotemia and poor PO intake in setting of continue diuretic use. 
Na of 128 at OSH improved to 133 after IVFs confirming this 
diagnosis. Sodium remained normal following IV fluids.   
  
# Atrial fibrillation: New onset, acute A.Fib without history of 
afib in past. Last EKG in ___ was sinus rhythm. Rate controlled 
throughout admission. Echo with AS and MR. ___ normal. Given 
CHADS2 of 3, patient started on coumadin without bridge and will 
need to be followed-up in ___ clinic as outpatient, 
goal INR ___. Started on metoprolol prior to discharge for 
ongoing rate control. Amlodipine stopped in favor of metoprolol 
for rate control given patient without significant hypertension 
during this admission. Discharged on metoprolol 25mg BID, this 
should be titrated as blood pressure tolerates with goal HR<90, 
>60. She should have an INR check on ___, with goal INR ___. 

         
# Anemia: Chronic normocytic anemia with baseline Hct of ___ 
admitted with acute drop in Hct to 26 of unclear etiology. 
Unlikely to be acute blood loss anemia due to hemodynamic 
stability and lack of symptoms. Possible related to worsening 
underlying renal disease and last Hct was over 3 months prior so 
maybe slowly downtrending due to worsening renal function. 
Hemolysis labs negative. Stool guaiac negative. Iron studies 
revealed iron deficiency and patient was started on iron 
supplementation which was continued at discharge. 
    
# Diabetes mellitus: Chronic, non-insulin dependent Diabetes 
Mellitus Type II complicated by diabetic nephropathy. Held 
Glipizide while inpatient and maintained on HISS.   
     
Transitional Issues:
# ___ clinic follow-up for management of anticoagulation in 
setting of new onset atrial fibrillation (goal INR ___ after 
discharge from rehab. ___ Phone Number is 
___. 
# CODE: DNR/DNI  
# CONTACT: ___ (daughter) ___
