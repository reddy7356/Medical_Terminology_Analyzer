History of Present Illness:
___ year old female transferred from ___ yesterday 
for
neurosurgical evaluation of right frontal SDH. Per OSH records,
patient was found down today by her roommate, unknown length of
down time. Patient is unable to recall specifics, although today

IMAGING: 
==========

SPINE CT WO CONTRAST ___
There is no evidence of cervical spine fracture.  There is no 
prevertebral 
soft tissue swelling.  Incidental note is made of non fusion of 
the posterior arch of C1.  Bones are demineralized.  There are 
mild multilevel degenerative changes.  There is straightening of 
the normal cervical lordosis. There is mild apical scarring.  
The thyroid is unremarkable.  There is no suspicious cervical 
adenopathy. 
  
IMPRESSION:    
No acute cervical spine fracture. 

HEAD CT WO CONTRAST ___
1. Right frontal extra-axial hematoma has increased in size 
compared to 
outside hospital CT measuring 11 mm (previously 7 mm), in part 
representing 
acute subdural hematoma, an epidural component is also of 
concern given 
lentiform appearance inferiorly.  No associated calvarial 
fracture. 
2. Foci of subarachnoid hemorrhage and small amount of 
intraventricular 
hemorrhage is unchanged. 

HEAD CT WO CONTRAST ___
1. No significant change to the right frontal extra-axial 
hematoma measuring 11 mm in greatest diameter from the inner 
table. Although no underlying calvarial fracture is seen, the 
lentiform shape of the hematoma remain concerning for epidural 
bleed.   
2. Unchanged foci of subarachnoid and intraventricular 
hemorrhage. 
3. Paranasal sinus disease as described above. 

CXR ___: 
Bilateral left greater than right interstitial abnormality, most 
likely 
chronic. 

TTE ___:
The left atrium is normal in size. There is mild symmetric left 
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and global 
systolic function (LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal technical 
quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully 
excluded. Tissue Doppler imaging suggests a normal left 
ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg). The aortic valve 
leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet 
excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation. The 
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral 
valve prolapse. There is mild mitral regurgitation. There is 
mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no 
pericardial effusion. 

IMPRESSION: poor image quality. No structural cause of syncope 
identified. Left ventricular function is probably normal, a 
focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. The 
right ventricle is not well seen. No pathologic valvular 
abnormality seen. Pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not 
be determined.

___ 04:55AM BLOOD Calcium-8.6 Phos-3.6 Mg-2.___ yo female with h/o dementia p/w intracranial hemorrhage in 
setting of unwitnessed syncope/fall. 

ACTIVE ISSUES: 
==========================
#  Fall: pt reported falling over her walker, although her 
caregiver at home reported she may have lost consciousness for a 
few seconds. Her EKG at OSH was normal sinus rhythm, and she was 
monitored on telemetry with no noted events. She was evaluated 
by ___ who recommended rehab with delirium precautions. Fall 
may have been in the setting of UTI found on routine culture 
data. TTE unrevealing with no structural cause of syncope but 
with findings of mild pulmonary hypertension and mild LVH. 
 
#  Subdural hematoma: found to have small R SDH without midline 
shift, no focal neurological deficits, initially admitted to 
neurosurgical service. Repeat scan showed increase from 7 mm to 
11 mm, and a mild mass effect with concern for element of 
epidural bleed appearance. She was found to have chronic 
right-sided facial droop, as well as ?dysarthria although this 
was described as hypophonia by neurosurgery; her daughter while 
visiting the hospital later confirmed that her mother was at her 
baseline and did not have any speech abnormalities. Her SBP was 
maintained <140 with valsartan. Her home ASA was held. She will 
need to f/u in 1 week with neurosurgery and get a repeat head CT 
at that time. Of note, per neurosurgery recommendations, no 
indication for keppra as she is on depakote. 

# Urinary tract infection: pt found to have E. coli in her 
urinary culture. She was started on IV CTX on ___ and 
transitioned to PO cefpodoxime for the outpatient setting to 
complete 7 day course (last dose ___. 

# Presumed bacterial conjunctivitis: pt has purulent drainage 
from eyes, reports it is "sometimes like this at home." She was 
given Bacitracin/polymyxin B ointment 5 days starting ___ 
with improvement in symptoms. 

# Hypoxia: on first night of transfer to medicine, pt found to 
desat overnight to the mid 80'___, required 2 L NC and improved 
with 10 mg IV Lasix. Did not require O2 afterwards. TTE 
unrevealing with no structural cause of syncope but with 
findings of mild pulmonary hypertension and mild LVH. 

CHRONIC ISSUES: 
==========================
# CAD: currently holding ASA 81 mg per NSG recommendations. 
Continued 20 mg simvastatin daily. 

# Bipolar d/o: continued wellbutrin 100 mg daily, risperadone 2 
mg daily, depakote 250 mg qAM and 500 qPM, 15 mg mirtazapine 
daily
 
# Dementia: Continue home wellbutrin and mirtazapine.

***Transitional issues***: 
- f/u CT scan in 1 week with appointment with Dr. ___ 
- home ASA 81 mg d/c'ed, can discuss whether to restart it at 
appointment with Dr. ___ 
- UTI: started on ceftriaxone ___, will send out with 7-day 
course of cefpodoxime to be completed ___
- bacterial conjunctivitis: started on bacitracin/polymyxin 
___ (end date ___ 
- etiology for one time episode of mild hypoxia unclear though 
TTE with mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension, consider 
further w/u if ongoing issues with hypoxia
- caregiver is ___ ___
