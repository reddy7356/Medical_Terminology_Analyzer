CT ABD/PELVIS:
1.  Findings compatible with closed loop obstruction with two 
transition points in the left hemipelvis and decompressed distal 
bowel loops with small bowel dilated proximally up to 4.3 cm.  
Free fluid in the pelvis and mesentery with thickening of the 
interposed segment between the transition points could reflect 
some degree of developing ischemia. 
2.  No evidence of diverticulitis.   
3.  Thickening of the left adrenal gland compatible with 
hyperplasia.  
 
Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ presented with symptoms concerning for bowel 
obstruction.  He had a CT scan that was concerning for

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,

It was a pleasure taking care of you at ___.  You were 
admitted to the hospital because of a bowel obstruction.  You 
had surgery to relieve the obstruction. 

ACTIVITY: 
Do not drive until you have stopped taking pain medicine and 
feel you could respond in an emergency.  You may climb stairs. 
You may go outside, but avoid traveling long distances until you 
see your surgeon at your next visit. Don't lift more than ___ 
lbs for 4 weeks. (This is about the weight of a briefcase or a 
bag of groceries.) This applies to lifting children, but they 
may sit on your lap. You may start some light exercise when you 
feel comfortable. You will need to stay out of bathtubs or 
swimming pools for a time while your incision is healing. Ask 
your doctor when you can resume tub baths or swimming.
 
HOW YOU MAY FEEL: 
You may feel weak or "washed out" for a couple of weeks. You 
might want to nap often. Simple tasks may exhaust you. You may 
have a sore throat because of a tube that was in your throat 
during surgery. You might have trouble concentrating or 
difficulty sleeping. You  might feel somewhat depressed.  You 
could have a poor appetite for a while. Food may seem  
unappealing. All of these feelings and reactions are normal and 
should go away in a short time.  If they do not, tell your 
surgeon.
 
YOUR INCISION:
Tomorrow you may shower and remove the gauzes over your 
incisions. The staples will be removed when we see you in 
clinic.  Your incisions may be slightly red around the stitches. 
This is normal. You may gently wash away dried material around 
your incision. Avoid direct sun exposure to the incision area. 
Do not use any ointments on the incision unless you were told 
otherwise. You may see a small amount of clear or light red 
fluid staining your dressing or clothes. If the staining is 
severe, please call your surgeon. You may shower. As noted 
above, ask your doctor when you may resume tub baths or 
swimming.
 
YOUR BOWELS:
Constipation is a common side effect of narcotic pain 
medicaitons. If needed, you may take a stool softener (such as 
Colace, one capsule) or gentle laxative (such as milk of 
magnesia, 1 tbs) twice a day. You can get both of these 
medicines without a prescription.  If you go 48 hours without a 
bowel movement, or have pain moving the bowels, call your 
surgeon. 
 
PAIN MANAGEMENT:
It is normal to feel some discomfort/pain following abdominal 
surgery. This pain is often described as "soreness". Your pain 
should get better day by day. If you find the pain is getting 
worse instead of better, please contact your surgeon.  You will 
receive a prescription for pain medicine to take by mouth. It is 
important to take this medicine as directed. Do not take it more 
frequently than prescribed. Do not take more medicine at one 
time than prescribed.
Your pain medicine will work better if you take it before your 
pain gets too severe.  Talk with your surgeon about how long you 
will need to take prescription pain medicine. Please don't take 
any other pain medicine, including non-prescription pain 
medicine, unless your surgeon has said its okay.  If you are 
experiencing no pain, it is okay to skip a dose of pain 
medicine.  Remember to use your "cough pillow" for splinting 
when you cough or when you are doing your deep breathing 
exercises.  If you experience any of the following, please 
contact your surgeon:
- sharp pain or any severe pain that lasts several hours
- pain that is getting worse over time
- pain accompanied by fever of more than 101
- a drastic change in nature or quality of your pain
 
MEDICATIONS:
You can resume all your usual home medications.
