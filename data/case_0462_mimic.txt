IMAGING:
===================
CT CHEST W/O CONTRAST     ___
1. Small amount of subcutaneous air is identified in the left 
anterior chest
wall at site of a prior procedure.  Radiodense material in the 
left anterior
chest wall may be related to prior surgery.  No abscess is 
identified within
the limits of noncontrast scan.
2. Multiple nodular opacities and ___ opacities in 
bilateral posterior
lower lobes are new since ___.  Findings may reflect infection, 
however
malignancy is difficult to rule out.  Consider follow-up CT to 
ensure
resolution.
3. Bronchiectasis and fibrotic changes in bilateral anterior 
lungs and lung
apices have progressed compared to ___, likely reflecting 
interval evolution
of radiation changes.
4. Severe compression fracture/complete collapse of T12 
vertebral body and
moderate compression fractures at T5, T6, T11, and L1 vertebral 
bodies are new
since ___.

MRI CHEST ___ W&W/O CONTRAST     ___
1.  Trace amount of fluid within left breast implant removal 
surgical cavity
with mild enhancement of the cavity and overlying skin may 
represent
granulomatous changes versus phlegmonous changes.  Some 
contiguous intercostal
enhancement is demonstrated extending from the superficial soft 
tissue process
towards the pleura.  Underlying pleuroparenchymal enhancement is 
demonstrated,
uncertain if this is related to contiguous inflammatory change 
versus sequela
of prior radiation change and chronic pleuroparenchymal 
scarring.  There is
however small left pleural effusion.
2.  Fragmentation of the proximal left clavicle is consistent 
with chronic
fracture.  No definite signs of osteomyelitis.  1-2 cm fluid 
pocket along the
inferior aspect of the left sternoclavicular joint with mild 
peripheral
enhancement may represent joint/effusion.
3.  Synovitis of the right shoulder without glenohumeral joint 
effusion may be
due to patient's underlying rheumatoid arthritis is less likely 
to be
infectious in the absence of localizing clinical concern this 
region.  Mild
bone marrow edema of the right humeral head may be reactive to 
underlying
process.
4.  Moderate amount of fluid within the right subcoracoid bursa 
with internal
debris and surrounding enhancement may be inflammatory due to 
patient
underlying rheumatoid arthritis or could be due to fracture of 
the coracoid
seen superiorly.
5.  1 cm fluid collection with peripheral enhancement medial to 
the right
coracoid may represent extension from subcoracoid bursal fluid 
or may be
related to fracture of the right coracoid process.  Right 
coracoid process
fracture is better seen on CT from ___, underlying 
lesion cannot be
excluded.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ is a ___ year old woman with history of bilateral 
breast cancer, s/p bilateral mastectomy, and washout and removal 
of implant in L breast in ___ iso MRSA cellulitis, 
presenting with unresolved erythema and drainage of her left 
lateral chest and pleuritic pain. VSS. Physical exam notable for 
a large (8in x 5in) confluent area of erythema on the L lateral 
chest with mild serous drainage, TTP. Labs were unremarkable. 
Wound culture grew MRSA again. Infectious disease consulted and 
recommended MRI given high risk for osteomyelitis. MRI with 
nonspecific changes, unable to rule out osteomyelitis. 
Infectious disease determined risk of treating was far less than 
risk of not treating. Treatment was initiated Vancomycin with 
plan to continue for 6 weeks. After initiation of vancomycin, 
region of erythema, drainage and pain improved significantly. 

#Breast Cellulitis
The patient has a history of cellulitis of the affected area 
from ___, which she says never resolved, and worsened 
post-discharge until this admission.  Vital signs were stable on 
admission.  Physical exam revealed a large (8in x 5in)confluent 
area of erythema on the L chest, with marker placed around 
periphery of erythema. There was a minor 1cm x 1cm pocket of 
tenderness/fluctuance over the T4-T5 rib.  CT revealed no fluid 
collection.  Given concern for unresolved original infection, 
she was empirically treated with vancomycin to cover gram 
positives including MRSA, the cause of the original infection.  
Culture of seropurulent fluid identified MRSA.  Vancomycin was 
continued. PRS was consulted.
- Acetaminophen ___ mg PO/NG Q8H:PRN Pain 

#Possible Osteomyelitis
Given the cellulitis's proximity to bone, focal tenderness on 
ribs on exam, and L-sided pleuritic pain, there was concern for 
possible osteomyelitis.  MRI was could not definitely rule out 
osteomyelitis.  On discussion with radiology, further studies 
have a high chance of being equivocal.  With the pericardium so 
close to the ribs, the risk of undertreating the infection is 
much higher than the risk of IV antibiotics for 6 weeks the 
patient should take a 6-week course of IV antibiotics. 

#Cachexia  
The patient appears cachectic - 88 lbs on this admission, from 
130 lbs ___ years ago.  Her breast cancer oncologist was consulted 
about this, and a ___ was ordered.  Nutrition was 
consulted, and Ensure Enlive was added to the patient's diet.
-- Multivitamins 1 TAB PO DAILY  

#History of Breast cancer  
-- Anastrozole 1 mg PO DAILY  
-- Calcium Carbonate 500 mg PO/NG TID
-- Vitamin D 1000 UNIT PO/NG DAILY   

#RA on humira, prednisone  
-- Prednisone 5 mg PO/NG DAILY
-- Humera held

#Hx of cerebellar stroke, in ___  
-- Aspirin EC 325 mg PO DAILY 
-- Atorvastatin 10 mg PO/NG QPM   

#Hypothyroidism  
-- Levothyroxine Sodium 50 mcg PO/NG DAILY 

#HTN  
-- Lisinopril 2.5 mg PO/NG DAILY  

#Dry eyes
-- Artificial Tears ___ DROP BOTH EYES PRN dryness
-- PrednisoLONE Acetate 1% Ophth. Susp. 1 DROP BOTH EYES BID  

Transitional Issues:
1. Monitor PICC line (placed ___ for any signs of infection 
for 6-week course of IV Vancomycin. 
2. Follow up with infectious disease for ongoing antibiotics.
3. Follow patient's weight and ensure adequate PO intake. 
Nutrition recs below:

- Oral supplements: Ensure Enlive TID.
- Daily weights
4. Per infectious disease patient may need imaging at end of 
antibiotic course to ensure resolution of possible 
osteomyelitis. 
5. Given worsening arthritis, consider home OT services for 
patient. 
6. Follow up with plastic surgery for ongoing management. While 
inpatient, Infectious disease and plastic surgery felt there was 
nothing to be drained/debride. Continue to monitor serous output 
from wound and region of erythema/tenderness. 
7. CT chest notable for 
- Multiple nodular opacities and ___ opacities in 
bilateral posterior lower lobes are new since ___. Findings may 
reflect infection, however malignancy is difficult to rule out. 
Consider follow-up CT to ensure resolution. 
- Severe compression fracture/complete collapse of T12 vertebral 
body and moderate compression fractures at T5, T6, T11, and L1 
vertebral bodies are new since ___. 
We recommend follow-up chest CT to ensure resolution of new 
nodular 
opacities in bilateral lower lobes. Consider DEXA scan. 
8. Follow up with rheumatology for management of humira given 
active infection.
9. ___ CRP 73.8, Sed rate 38 (normal <30)
10. Continue to monitor diarrhea. C.diff negative while in house

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,

You came into the hospital because you were having pain in your 
L breast. You were evaluated by the plastic surgery team who 
felt that you had an infection in your L breast implant. The 
implant was removed and a drain was placed. Your pain and lab
