PERTINENT IMAGING 
___ CT CHEST W/CONTRAST
-Extensive pulmonary and pleural metastasis is new or 
significantly worse since ___.  Right partially 
loculated pleural effusion is larger. Small left pleural 
effusion is new.
-New lytic lesions and mild loss of a in T8 and L4.
- Please see separately dictated CT of the abdomen and pelvis 
for complete description of subdiaphragmatic findings.

___ CT ABD/PELVIS 
1. Interval worsening local and distant metastatic disease as 
detailed above.
2. New bilateral moderate hydroureteronephrosis with bilateral 
renal
enlargement secondary to obstructive nephropathy related to the 
infiltrative pelvic mass lesion, involving the urinary bladder 
wall.
3. No obvious acute intra-abdominal infectious process.  
Although the hepatic hypoenhancing lesion is likely representing 
a centrally necrotic metastatic deposit to the liver given the 
extent and appearance of metastatic disease elsewhere, if there 
is clinical concern that this may represent an abscess, further 
characterization with MRI may be of benefit.
 
 
Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ is a ___ with a history of HIV, metastatic anal 
cancer s/p ___ and radiation therapy complicated by 
malignant bowel obstructions requiring ex-lap and 
ileostomy/colostomy, who was admitted to ___ on ___ with 
altered mental status and weakness in the setting of 
hypercalcemia. Though mental status returned to baseline with 
correction of calcium, imaging showed evidence of progressive 
tumor involvement and extensive perineal wounds concerning for 
osteomyelitis. On ___ the patient and his family opted to 
transition management plan towards Hospice Care. 

#Goals of Care: 
#Metastatic Anal Cancer: 
Family meeting occurred on ___ with patient's HCP, primary 
oncologist, and ___ medical team. The medical team 
expressed their concerns about the patient's worsening mental 
status, poor nutrition, and overall decline. The family was made 
aware that chemotherapy was only an option if the patient's 
functional status improved to the point where he no longer 
required hospital-level care. If he was unable to receive 
chemotherapy given underlying health, the medical team 
recommended that we transition our goals of care to focus on his 
comfort. The family expressed understanding of the situation and 
chose to make code status DNR/DNI. As the patient's mental 
status cleared he became better able to participate in his care. 
On ___ he began to express to the team his hesitation to 
proceed with plans for chemotherapy and ultimately on ___ upon 
further discussion with his primary oncologist expressed the 
desire to transition towards hospice care with the goals of 
focusing on comfort, spending time with loved ones and being in 
a comfortable and safe place, possible at home. On ___ 
palliative care was consulted for further assistance with 
transition towards hospice. They provided the patient and family 
with support and recommended a plan for pain management as noted 
below. 

#Acute toxic-metabolic encephalopathy
Likely multifactorial in the setting of malignancy, 
malnutrition, infection, and metabolic derangements such as 
hypercalcemia (corrected calcium of 14 on arrival). On 
admission, the patient was started on broad spectrum antibiotics 
to treat for possible underlying infection. He was also given IV 
multivitamin, thiamine, and folate. Hypercalcemia workup was 
suggestive of hypercalcemia secondary to bony metastases and 
immobility, with suppressed PTH and normal PTHrp. The patient 
received pamidronate, calcitonin and IVF with improvement in 
calcium levels. Return of mental status appeared to correlate, 
though Calcium levels began to uptrend and remained borderline 
elevated on discharge. 

#Fever of Unknown Origin
Patient continued to be intermittently febrile throughout 
hospitalization. He was started on broad spectrum antibiotics 
vancomycin/ceftazidime/flagyl though with continued fevers. 
Blood and urine cultures remained negative. CT torso on ___ 
showed evidence of worsening tumor burden compared to imaging in 
___ with appreciable involvement of lungs, liver, bladder, 
retroperitoneum and general pelvis. It was unclear if fevers 
were related to tumor burden or an underlying infectious source, 
though many of the suspected sources including a right pleural 
effusion, liver mass and perineal wound with air tracking into 
sacrum, would require more invasive testing. ID was consulted 
and helped guide work up for treatable sources through 
non-invasive testing (serologies sent) in an effort to minimize 
discomfort for the family. RPR, serum crypt Ag, toxoplasma 
serology, CMV serology, HCV serology were all negative (CMV 
consistent with prior infection, no detected viral load). Given 
unclear etiology of fevers and negative culture data, 
antibiotics were discontinued ___ without a change in clinical 
status or fever curve. Based on assessment of perineal wounds 
and CT, the patient most likely has osteomyelitis involving the 
coccyx/sacrum. Further work up was not pursued as this did not 
align with patient's goals of care. 

#Perineal/Right gluteal wound 
A large portion of hospitalization was focused on pain 
management and wound care. Despite daily wound management, 
likely in the setting of severe malnutrition and immobilization, 
the perineal surgical wound deteriorated to the extent of 
palpable bone through the distal portion of the wound. There 
remains high suspicion for osteomyelitis at the wound bed, 
though given transition of care to hospice, further work up was 
not pursued. 

#Normocytic anemia
Iron studies consistent with inflammatory block. The patient 
received blood transfusions on ___, and ___ for 
Hgb<7.0. 

#HIV: continued on home meds. Meds discontinued prior to 
discharge after decision made for hospice.

IMAGING:
=============================
___ RENAL US
FINDINGS: 
The right kidney measures 12.3 cm. The left kidney measures 14 
cm. There is no
stones, or masses bilaterally.  There is mild to moderate 
bilateral
hydronephrosis without obstructing lesion seen.  Normal cortical 
echogenicity
and corticomedullary differentiation are seen bilaterally. The 
bladder is moderately well distended and normal in appearance.
IMPRESSION: 
Mild to moderate bilateral hydronephrosis without an obstructing 
lesion
identified.

___ KUB:
IMPRESSION: 
Dilated small bowel with air-fluid levels, but accompanied by 
distended gas
and stool-filled colon.  Findings could represent ileus or 
partial small bowel
obstruction.  No free air.

___ RENAL US
IMPRESSION:
1. Interval resolution of bilateral hydronephrosis.
2. The bladder contains debris, however is incompletely 
evaluated due to presence of a Foley catheter. If further 
evaluation of the bladder is desired, repeat ultrasound after 
clamping the Foley, or cystoscopy could be performed.

___ CT CHEST W/ CONTRAST:
IMPRESSION:
-Mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy is new since ___ 
as are the
bilateral pulmonary cavitated masses suspected for metastasis.
-New multifocal pneumonia of the right lung with right small 
layering pleural
effusion.

___ CT A/P W/ CONTRAST:
IMPRESSION:
1. Postoperative changes post anal cancer resection which extend 
into the prostate as described.  New small-bowel obstruction 
with a transition point at the surgical resection site.
2. New right hepatic metastasis causing nonocclusive thrombus in 
a small hepatic venous branch and segmental biliary obstruction.
3. Please see the separately submitted report of the same day CT 
Chest for findings above the diaphragm.

___ CT A/P W/ CONTRAST IMPREESSION:
1. Large pneumoperitoneum, new since ___.  Given no 
extra luminal oral contrast administered via jejunostomy, 
unlikely due to bowel perforation. 
2. Interval increase in size of hepatic hypodensity and 
progressive occlusion of a branch of right hepatic vein compared 
to ___.  Given short term interval change, the 
hepatic lesion is concerning for an abscess, though metastatic 
disease is still possible. 
3. Increased low-density ascites. 
4. Persistently open wound in the gluteal region, status post 
abdominoperoneal resection. 
5. Persistent small bowel obstruction with transition point in 
the pelvis. 

___ RENAL U/S IMPRESSION: 
1. Limited evaluation of the kidneys due to poor acoustic window 
and patient position.  However, previous hydronephrosis is no 
longer visualized. 
2. Echogenic liver likely due to steatosis 

___ CT A/P W/ CONTRAST IMPRESSION: 
1. Hypodense lesion in the right hepatic lobe is increased in 
size since the prior study.  Given the rapid increase in size, 
findings are most suggestive of abscess, though a particularly 
aggressive metastatic lesion is not entirely excluded. 
2. The open surgical wound in the posterior lower pelvis is 
contiguous with a right hemipelvic collection, slightly 
increased in size since the prior study. There is increasing rim 
of enhancement with increased organization as compared the prior 
study.  Findings are consistent with a developing abscess. 
3. Increased cortical erosion of the right pubic symphysis 
adjacent to the 
right hemipelvic collection is concerning for osteomyelitis.  
Cortical erosion has been slowly increasing in this area since ___ and was not present on the ___ study.  
Additionally, there is now more clear visualization of a linear 
lucency through this area, which may represent a pathologic 
fracture through this area. 
4. New peritoneal enhancement is noted as well as moderate 
volume ascites, 
increased since the prior study raising the possibility of 
peritonitis. 
5. Severe bladder wall thickening, increased since the prior 
study, may 
represent radiation versus infectious cystitis.  Clinical 
correlation is 
recommended. 
6. Multiple bilateral lung masses compatible with metastatic 
disease, grossly unchanged since prior study. 

___ RUQ U/S IMPRESSION: 
1. Abnormal structure in the right hepatic lobe would be 
amenable to 
aspiration/drainage with ultrasound if clinically appropriate, 
but in addition to abscess, the differential includes solid or 
necrotic metastatic lesion. 
2. Loculated ascites. 

___ CT A/P W/ CONTRAST IMPRESSION: 
1. Minimal decrease in volume of loculated abdominal and pelvic 
ascites, with continued reactive peritoneal enhancement. 
2. Interval enlargement and increased cortical destruction of a 
right iliac metastasis in comparison to the ___ 
study. 
3. New 9 mm lytic metastasis along the superior aspect of the L4 
vertebral 
body. 
4. Interval slight enlargement of a right lower pelvic soft 
tissue mass with destruction of the posterior aspect of the 
pubic symphysis. 
5. Interval slight enlargement of a right hepatic metastasis. 
6. Post APR and small-bowel resection, with left lower quadrant 
colostomy and right lower quadrant ileostomy.  Large posterior 
lower pelvic wound is 
minimally changed in comparison to the prior study.  Moderate 
distention of small bowel, without high-grade obstruction. 
7. Known left lower lobe pulmonary mass and moderate right 
pleural effusion are unchanged since ___, partially 
visualized on this study. 
8. Thickened bladder wall is unchanged, compatible with 
cystitis. 
9. Moderate splenomegaly. 

___ US-GUIDED PARACENTESIS IMPRESSION:
1. Technically successful ultrasound guided diagnostic 
paracentesis. 
2. 195 mL of clear straw-colored fluid were removed. 

___ CXR IMPRESSION:
Lungs continue to be low volume with improved pulmonary edema.  
Small 
bilateral effusions right greater than left are stable.  Left IJ 
line projects to the cavoatrial junction.  No pneumothorax is 
seen.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ is a ___ yo male with a history of metastatic anal 
cancer and HIV who was admitted on ___ with ___ and 
constipation, with findings of new LAD and bilateral cavitary 
lesions on CT, and who ultimately has had a prolonged course due 
to malignant bowel obstruction s/p NGT and J-tube placement 
(nausea, vomiting, decreased UOP and stool output), with course 
significantly complicated by bowel perforation on ___ now 
s/p exploratory laparotomy, repair of enterotomy, small bowel 
resection, and end ileostomy; who has had post-op course 
complicated by difficult pain management (s/p PCA with 
improvement) and ___.

================================================================

FICU COURSE:

Patient was brought to the FICU after ex lap, repair of 
enterotomy, and small bowel resection end ileostomy. He remained 
intubated after the surgery upon arrival on ___. He was weaned 
to pressure support on ___ and tolerated a spontaneous 
breathing trial. He was successfully extubated on ___. Patient 
remained hypotensive on ___, requiring 4L IVF and levophed 
drip for a brief period of time. NICOM was used and demonstrated 
hypotension was fluid responsive. Levophed drip was weaned and 
BP remained stable. Patient remained on Zosyn. His pain was 
controlled with IV Dilaudid while fentanyl gtt was weaned. 
Developed ___ renal was consulted and felt it was likely 
related to ATN. His Cr was downtrending when patient was called 
out of FICU. Had acute drop in Hgb, felt to be secondary to 
blood loss from wound on back and dilutional. He was transfused 
1u pRBCs. Wound culture growing GNRs. 

================================================================

#Sinus Tachycardia: Baseline rates 100s-120s with occasional 
spikes to 140s. Occurs at rest and with activity. Never 
associated with hypotension, dyspnea, hypoxia or other symptoms. 
Extensive infectious work up has been negative. Prior CTAs 
negative though noted to be >1 month ago. Given lack of hypoxia 
or respiratory distress in the setting of lovenox ppx, PE is 
unlikely. Likely due to hypovolemia and deconditioning in 
addition to inflammatory state due to underlying malignancy. 

#Malignant Bowel Obstruction
#S/p bowel perforation
In the setting of decreased stool output, N/V and abdominal 
pain, CT abdomen/pelvis was obtained and patient was found to 
have an distal bowel obstruction. S/p ___ guided placement of 
decompressive J-tube ___. On ___, was found to have 
significantly worsened diffuse abdominal pain, KUB with slight 
free air and bowel loop distention, and ultimately was found to 
have significant free air concerning for bowel perforation on 
CT. He was taken urgently to the OR, where he 
underwent an exploratory laparotomy, repair of enterotomy, small 
bowel resection, and end ileostomy. He was transferred to the 
colorectal surgery service. His peritoneal fluid grew E. Coli 
for which he was treated with Zosyn 4.5mg q8 hours. This was 
stopped on ___. He treated with a PCA for pain control, which 
was ultimately stopped and he was transition to a PO regimen. At 
discharge, his pain regimen was: 
OxyCODONE (Immediate Release) 15 mg PO/NG Q3H:PRN 
OxyCODONE SR (OxyconTIN) 120 mg PO Q12H 
HYDROmorphone (Dilaudid) 3 mg IV BID:PRN Dressing changes, 
position changes 
LORazepam 0.5 mg PO/NG Q6H:PRN anxiety/nausea 
Cyclobenzaprine 10 mg PO/NG TID:PRN muscle spasms 
Gabapentin 300 mg PO/NG TID 

#Malnutrition: Received TPN intermittently, and diet was 
advanced as tolerated. He was noted to have significant weight 
loss during his hospitalization. We had discussed placing a 
 ___ for feeding and explained to the patient that his 
nutrition was very important for his wound healing and recovery, 

however the patient declined a feeding tube.

#Acute Kidney Injury: Baseline Cr ~1.0. Has had multiple AKIs
throughout his prolonged hospitalization - initially post-renal 
(Cr 4.7 on admission) that was resolved with a Foley (remains in 

place), another in the setting of surgery and sepsis leading to 
ATN. The patient was discharged with a foley catheter due to 
failed voiding trials with plans to see urology as anoutpatient. 


#Anal cancer:
#Surgical wound: 
#Fevers:
CT chest/abd/pelvis c/f new metastasis in the liver and lungs; 
also found to have an SBO c/b perforation (see above). Later 
during his hospitalization, had a CT with findings of new bony 
lesions most concerning for metastasis. Not currently on 
treatment, but plans to receive outpatient chemotherapy after 
discharge. Additionally, the patient was found to have low grade 

fevers at night. Extensive infectious work up was performed 
including blood/urine cultures, chest x-ray, CT Abd/pelvis, 
CMV/EBV testing in addition tosampling of known intra-abdominal 
fluid collections which was unrevealing. Due to increased 
malignant disease with new ___ metastasis seen on repeat 
abdominal cross sectional imaging, his fevers and flutuating 
leukocytosis were attributed to malignancy. We discussed his 
case with plastics surgery out of concern for wound infection. 
They stated that his wound was healing well and the amount of 
drainage that was noted in the wound was to be expected. They 
recommended against and MRI to assess for deep wound infection. 
In addition, the patient would not have been able to tolerate 
lying flat for an MRI.

#Anemia:
S/p multiple pRBCs transfusions throughout his prolonged 
hospitalization. Previously thought to be ___ anemia of chronic 
disease and sepsis. His Hgb eventually stabilized in the 8s by 
time of discharge. 

#HIV - Family DOES NOT KNOW ABOUT HIV STATUS:
Continued dolutegarvier, emtricitabine-tenofovir. His primary 
care physician started him on Bactrim, which was discontinued 
due to renal failure. His ID doctor and primary oncologist were 
e-mailed regarding starting Bactrim again vs. Atovaquone. 
Toxoplasma IgG were negative and thus, it was safe to hold 
Bactrim indefinitely; he was initiated on prophylactic 
Atovaquone at discharge.

#Hypercalcemia, resolved: Likely due to inactivity and new bony 
lesions. PTH appropriately depressed. Ca worsened despite IVF 
administration, however pt remained symptomatic. Vitamin D <5. 
S/p IV Pamidronate 60mg x1 on ___, with subsequent resolution 
of his hypercalcemia. Given low Vitamin D level, he was started 
on 1000U Vitamin D daily. His PTHrP was wnl.

#Maculopapular rash, resolved: likely folliculitis from sweating 

in hospital bed. Improved with anti-histamines and moisturizing 
lotion. Given resolution of symptoms, discontinued Fexofenadine 
and Benadryl PRN. He was continued on Sarna lotion QID PRN.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,

You came to the hospital because you were constipated for a 
week, and your labs showed that your kidneys were injured.  We 
gave you fluids and also put in a Foley catheter.  Your kidney 
function improved, and you will need to follow up with a 
urologist to determine how long the catheter will need to stay 
in place.

We also found that you have a bowel obstruction, which was 
causing your diarrhea. You had a nasogastric tube and a 
jejunostomy tube placed to help decompress your bowels. You were 
started on TPN, a form of nutrition that you receive through a 
___ line. 

Please make sure you keep your follow-up appointments and take 
medications as listed below.  It is important that you keep your 
bowels moving, and we have prescribed some medications to help 
make sure this happens.  If your stools become too loose or 
frequent, you can stop the senna but continue taking the other 
medications. If your ostomy output stops again for more than 2 
days, contact your doctor.

It was a pleasure taking care of you,
–Your ___ Team
