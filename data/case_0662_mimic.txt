STUDIES:
* ___ CT abd/pelvis: Thrombus in the left atrium. Thrombosis of 
the proximal superior mesenteric artery with distal 
reconstitution probably through collateral flow. No evidence of 
small or large bowel wall thickening or adjacent inflammatory 
change to suggest ischemia. Thrombosis of the left renal artery 
and associated infarction of the left kidney. Wedge compression 
deformities of L1 and L3 are probably chronic.  
* ___ CXR: NG tube in good position. Stable cardiomegaly, mild 
left lower lobe atelectasis. No evidence of pneumonia or CHF.  
* ___ Head CT: No acute intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect. 
Overall similar appearance of the brain compared to ___ with 
multiple areas of old infarction demonstrated. Please note that 
MR with diffusion-weighted imaging is more sensitive for 
evaluation of acute infarction if this is a significant clinical 
concern. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
a/p:  ___ yo female with afib, CVA x2, dementia, now with SMA 
clot, ___, non-enhancing kidney on CT and anuria with 
unresponsiveness.
.
# abdominal pain/hypotension - pt admitted to the surgical 
service, and found to have thrombus in left renal artery (with 
complete left renal infarction), and superior mesenteric artery. 
 She had radiographic L renal infarction.  serial lactates were 
trending down, and pt was without peritonitis.  She was treated 
conservatively with antibiotics and NGT decompression and 
heparin gtt.  she was not felt to require surgical intervention. 
 her abdominal pain resolved.  She was awaiting transfer to the 
medical service when her mental status acutely declined as 
below.  
. 
# Altered mental status: Per family, patient's mental status has 
been declining ever since her last CVA.  Admission CT HEAD 
showed no acute bleeding, but could not exclude embolic event.  
She has known clot in SMA, left renal artery and LEFT atrial 
thrombus (seen on CT superior cuts of CT abd/pelvis) despite 
anticoagulation with coumadin.  She was placed on heparin during 
this hospitalization for concern for SMA and renal artery 
thrombosis.  However on ___ pt's mental status acute declined.  
She was no longer able to communicate reliable.  Concern was for 
recurrent stroke given her history of atrial fibrillation and 
left atrial thrombus as above, in spite of heparin 
anticoagulation.  Given her acute mental status decline, despite 
anticoagulation, decision was made with family to change goals 
of care to DNR/DNI.  Pt's mental status failed to improve after 
transfer to the MICU, and given goals of care did not include 
BIPAP or invasive lines or procedures, she was ___ to the 
medical floor.  Her mental status remained poor.  She was 
continued on empiric antibiotics for concern for PNA, though CXR 
was unremarkable.  
.
On ___, mental status had failed to improve.  After extensive 
discussion with both pt's HCP ___ ___ and her 
son ___ ___, decision was made to change 
goals of care to comfort measures only, as it was felt that she 
had likely suffered a recurrent stroke in spite of heparin 
anticoagulation.  Family clearly did not desire PEG tube 
placement, and agree that further anticoagulation would not 
likely alter her prognosis.  Her coumadin was discontinued.  Her 
urine output declined quickly.  She was evaluated by the pain 
and palliative care service, placed on a regimen or oral 
morphine elixir prn, though she did not complain of signficant 
pain.  she was placed on scopolamine patch to manage secretions. 
 
. 
Arrangements were made to transfer her to an ___ facility. 
. 
# Atrial fibrillation:  h/o atrial fibrillation with known left 
atrial thrombus despite coumadin, pt was treated with heparin 
gtt and rate controlled with metoprolol, these were discontinued 
given her goals of care as above. 
.
# Oliguria: likely due to poor po intake, and poor prognosis as 
above.  decision was made not to pursue PEG tube feeding or 
intravenous hydration as it was not felt likely to alter her 
prognosis.  Over the course of ___ her urine output continue 
to decline to neglible levels.
.
# Hypothyroidism: pt initialy continued on 75 mcg levothyroxine, 
this was d/c'd at discharge given goals of care. 
.
# Contact: ___ ___ (health care proxy) and her 
son ___ ___ ___ speaking). 
.
# CODE STATUS:  pt is DNR/DNI, she is comfort measures only. 
.
# DISPO: pt was discharged to ___ facility ___ after 
discussion with ___ at ___ who confirmed discussion with 
his mother (HCP) at 3PM and confirmed that she will meet pt at 
the ___ facility.
