IMAGING:
___ Imaging CTA ABD/PEL W&W/O C W/R 
1. No active extravasation of contrast to suggest current GI 
bleed.  
Circumferential wall thickening of the distal descending colon 
and sigmoid 
compatible with colitis.  This may be due to ischemia, infection 
or 
inflammation.  Patent central arterial and venous vasculature. 
2. Compression deformities at L4 and L5 with bilateral L4 
pedicle fractures 
and retropulsion of the superior aspect of the L4 vertebral body 
into the 
canal.  There is some callus formation suggesting that this is 
not entirely 
acute however the retroperitoneal fat demonstrates mild 
stranding.  Clinical 
correlation regarding acuity suggested. 
3. Bilateral adrenal nodules, potentially adenomas though 
incompletely 
characterized on this exam. 
4. Moderate to large hiatal hernia containing majority of the 
stomach and 
portion of the pancreas. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ is a ___ M with PMH HTN, pAF on Coumadin, VT/Brugada 
s/p ICD, diverticulosis, L3/L4 fx on fentanyl patch who presents 
with bright red blood per rectum, concerning for diverticular 
bleed iso Coumadin, s/p vitamin K reversal, admitted to 
medicine. He remained hemodynamically stable with no more 
episodes of bright red blood per rectum while hospitalized. He 
was discharged home with close PCP ___. 

# Gastrointestinal Bleed:
Concerning for diverticular bleed given colonoscopy ___ years ago. 
Likely triggered in setting of severe constipation secondary to 
fentanyl patch, poor compliance with laxatives, while 
therapeutic on Coumadin. His subcutaneous heparin was held and 
he received vitamin K as well as blood. He remained 
hemodynamically stable. 

# Constipation.
Constipation was likely in the setting of recent fentanyl patch 
initiation two weeks ago. On senna at home but per family, 
poorly compliant. He was given docusate, senna, and miralax. He 
should continue senna and miralax daily so that he has one soft 
bowel movement per day. 

# Paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillation
On Coumadin at home, INR therapeutic on admission. He recieved 
PO vitamin K in the ER given his rectal bleeding. CHADSVASC ___. 
We continued his amiodarone 100 mg QD and his warfarin was 
restarted on discharge. 

# Low Back Pain
# L3, L4 Compression Fractures/Retropulsion
Seen on CT abd on admission, as well as CT L spine earlier this 
month. Followed by Dr. ___ NSGY, recently seen 3 
weeks ago, opted for LSO brace with f/u MRI in 2 months given 
would be high risk surgery. He continued his fentanyl patch q72h 
12.5 mcg

# Hypertension:
The patient was continued on amlodipine 5 mg QD as well as 
lisinopril 40 mg QD (fosinopril non-formulary).

# VT/Brugada Syndrome, s/p ICD
Patient continued on amiodarone as above.

# Coronary Artery Disease
# Hyperlipidemia
- per chart review, could not tolerate statins

Transitional Issues:
========================
[] Bilateral adrenal nodules, potentially adenomas though 
incompletely characterized on this exam.
[] Follow up with neurosurgery in 2 months with MRI 
[] warfarin restarted on discharge at home dose. Please monitor 
INR closely. 
[] please check CBC in 1 week to ensure hemoglobin not 
downtrending
