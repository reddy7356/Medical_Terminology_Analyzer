EKG: Normal sinus rhythm, rate 73. Low limb lead voltage. Q 
waves in III and aVF raising question of an inferior wall 
myocardial infarction of indeterminate age. Non-specific changes 
are unchanged compared to tracing of ___ 

CXR ___: FINDINGS: AP portable supine chest radiograph is 
obtained. The lungs are clear bilaterally without focal 
consolidation, effusion, or pneumothorax.  Vague opacity at the 
left mid and lower lung likely corresponds with areas of 
costochondral calcification. Heart size is top normal. No 
pleural effusion or pneumothorax. No definite displaced rib 
fractures are seen.  

CT Abd/Pelvis ___: IMPRESSION: 
1. No evidence of hemorrhage or acute intra-abdominal injury. 
2. Gallstones. 

CT neck ___: IMPRESSION: No acute fracture or subluxation of 
the cervical spine. As there is moderate central canal 
narrowing, if there is concern for cord injury, MRI is more 
sensitive for detection of this finding. 

CT head ___: IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial process. 
Previous area of air within the superior sagittal sinus is no 
longer present. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
This is a ___ yo M with a long and varied PMH that includes 
Hidgkins Lymphoma, Drug and alcohol abuse, DM2, Hyperlipidemia, 
GERD, depression, chronic back pain, and seizure history on 
Valproic acid who presents with acute on chronic neck pain and 
found to have ___, hypotension, fevers, and an elevated valproic 
acid level.
.
1. Valproic Acid Toxicity: The patient is treated with valproic 
acid for a seizure history. The patient notes that he has been 
compliant with his treatment, although he does describe multiple 
episodes of "seizures" that he can voluntarily stop. In the ED, 
the patient was found to have a slightly elevated valproic acid 
serum level to 131. The patient also had an acute creatinine 
rise, hypotension, and slight altered mental status that could 
have been attributed to toxic levels of valproate. Our 
toxicology consults recommended that we check an ammonia level, 
which returned at 198 and peaked at 391. They recommended giving 
one dose of L-carnitine, for possible urea cycle enzyme 
deficiency, and then to recheck an ammonia. On recheck, the 
patient's ammonia was trending down. His hypotension and ___ 
resolved with fluids. His valproate level quickly trended down 
as well. On the morning of admission, the patient felt much 
improved. Due to his seizure history, we decided to place him 
back on his valproate at half the dose. The patient was given 
quick follow-up with his PCP, and his PCP was emailed to let him 
know that the patient may develop future toxicity if he has a 
urea cycle enzymatic deficiency.
.
2. Neck Pain: The patient has chronic neck pain, which he 
described as being acutely worse. A head and neck CT was done in 
the ED which did not show any acute processes. The patient's 
head CT did have an artifact in a sinus, but on repeat this had 
resolved. The patient was continued on his lidocaine patch, 
soma, and fiorcet.
- cont. lidocaine patch, soma, fioricet BID prn for h/a   
.
CHRONIC ISSUES
.
1. CVA risk factors: WE continued aspirin and plavix
.  
2. Peripheral neuropathy: Secondary to lymphoma chemotherapy. 
Continued Gabapentin.
.  
3. Narcotic/cocaine abuse: Continued the patient's home Suboxone 
8mg BID     
.  
4. HIV Risk Factors: The patient had concerns about HIV 
infection, given his sexual partner's HIV+ status. An HIV Ab 
test was performed which returned negative. The patient was 
counselled that if he had concerns about acute infection, then 
he should have repeat testing done in one month.

Activity Status: Ambulatory - Independent.

 
Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted to the hospital with chronic neck pain. The ED 
ordered a CT scan of the head and neck which was normal. The 
neck pain was mostly due to your chronic, degenerative disk 
disease. During the workup of your neck pain, we found some lab 
abnormalities that was determined to be due to Valproic Acid 
toxicity. We gave you some fluids and a medicine that fixed your 
lab results. We decreased your dose of the medicine and will 
have you follow-up with your primary doctor for any other 
medication changes. You had an HIV test here that was negative. 
As we discussed, you should be retested in ___ weeks if you are 
still concerned about a recent infection.

Medication Changes:
Take 500mg Valproic Acid by mouth twice a day. This is decreased 
from 1000mg twice a day.
