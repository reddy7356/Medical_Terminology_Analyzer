CXR ___: PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST: The cardiac, 
mediastinal and hilar contours are normal. The patient is status 
post right mastectomy. The pulmonary vascularity is not 
engorged. Ill-defined nodular opacities are again demonstrated 
within the right lung base, which appear to correspond to 
nodules seen on prior PET CT. No focal consolidation, pleural 
effusion or pneumothorax is identified. There are no acute 
osseous findings. 
  
IMPRESSION: No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality. Ill-defined 
nodular 
opacities in the right lung base are better visualized on the 
prior PET CT. 
.
CT ABD/PELV ___: CT ABDOMEN: The visualized lung bases are 
clear. No pleural or pericardial effusion.  
  
The liver, gallbladder, spleen, pancreas, and bilateral adrenal 
glands are 
normal. The kidneys enhance symmetrically and excrete contrast 
promptly. The large bowel is normal in course and caliber. 
Normal appendix. There is mild small bowel wall thickening 
involving the jejunum without wall edema or surrounding 
stranding. 
  
The aorta is normal in course and caliber with minimal 
atherosclerotic 
calcifications. No free air and no free fluid. No mesenteric or 
retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy. 
  
CT PELVIS: The rectum, sigmoid colon, bladder, and uterus are 
normal. No 
free fluid and no pelvic or inguinal lymphadenopathy. 
  
BONE WINDOWS: No lytic or sclerotic lesion suspicious for 
malignancy is seen. 
  
IMPRESSION:  
1. Mild jejunal bowel wall thickening is nonspecific but can be 
seen in 
enteritis. Major mesenteric vessels are patent. 
2. Normal appendix. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ y/o female with breast CA under chemotherapy who developed 
intermittent peribumbillical abd dull pain (___) associated 
with nausea and fevers.
.
#  Fever/diarrhea:  Felt to be most consistent with 
gastroenteritis. (likely viral, though bacterial also possible). 
 Abominal CT showed mild jejunal bowel wall thickening which was 
non-specific but could be consistent with enteritis. She was 
started on cefepime/flagyl (eventually changed to zosyn then PO 
cipro given concern for transaminitis explained below) and 
diarrhea improved over the course of admission decreasing in 
both frequency and volume.  She was maintained on IV fluids 
which were weaned off once she started tolerating a full diet.  
Stool studies were negative.  She remained afebrile throughout 
the entire admission.  However, given her neutropenia in the 
setting of her recent chemo, the decision was made to keep her 
inpatient until her symptoms resolved.  While she remained 
neutropenic throughout admission (nadiring at ___ of 12), her 
ANC was trending up to 198 on discharge, and in the setting of 
her improved clinical picture we felt she was safe for 
discharge.  Antibiotics were discontinued on discharge.   She 
was counseled heavily on returning to the hospital if abdominal 
pain/diarrhea worsened or if she developed fever.  
. 
# Elevated LFT's:  Pt noted to have uptrending LFTs with ALT/AST 
peaking at 105/123 in the setting of normal LDH and ___.  This 
was likely secondary to recent Taxotere/Cyclophosphomide vs 
cefepmie.  She denied any new abdominal symptoms besides her 
improving abdominal pain and diarrhea.  Cefepime was 
discontinued as above given that this may be contributing to her 
LFTs.  LFTs were downtrending on discharge to ALT/AST of 75/58.
.
# Left arm erythema: Pt developed a small area of faint left arm 
erythema over the medial aspect by her prior IV site.  It was 
slightly hard and tender to touch.  However this improved over 
the course of admission and nearly resolved on discharge.
.
# Breast Cancer: Pt received C1D1 of Taxotere + Cyclophosphomide 
on ___ with ANC nadiring to 12 during this admission.  She was 
continued on her home femara.  As mentioned above, given the 
improvement in her ANC and resolving symptoms, we felt she was 
ready for discharge despite still being neutropenic. She was 
counseled heavily on returning to the hospital if abdominal 
pain/diarrhea worsened or if she developed fever.
.
# Anemia:  Likely secondary to chemo.  She was not having any 
BRBPR or melena to suggest GIB.  Hct dropped from 34.4-->31 on 
admission, likely in setting of hemodilution.  Hct subsequently 
remained stable between 34-37 for remainder of admission.
.
# Hyponatremia:  Na was 129 on admission, likely hypovolemic 
given her diarrhea.  Sodium quickly improved with fluids
.
# HTN:  Pt continued on home metoprolol 100mg daily and 
valsartan 80mg daily.
.
# Depression:  Continued home effexor and prozac 
.
# Follow up/Transitional:
-Pt to follow-up with her outpatient oncologist Dr. ___ on ___
-Pt instructed to return to the hospital if abdominal 
pain/diarrhea worsened or if she develops fever.
