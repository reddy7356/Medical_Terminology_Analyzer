Pertinent Results:
Cardiac Catheterization ___ at ___

LAD calcified proximal 70-80%, mid ___, D1 origin 60%, D2 
diffuse 80-90%
Lcx OM1 50-60% before distal bifurcation 
RCA severely calcified with diffuse 80-90% in ___ to mid 

Echocardiogram ___ at ___
LEFT ATRIUM: Moderately increased LA volume index. 
RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Moderately dilated RA. 
LEFT VENTRICLE: Mild symmetric LVH. Normal LV cavity size. 
Suboptimal technical quality, a focal LV wall motion abnormality 
cannot be fully excluded. Overall normal LVEF (>55%). TDI E/e' < 
8, suggesting normal PCWP (<12mmHg). No resting LVOT gradient. 
RIGHT VENTRICLE: RV not well seen. 
AORTA: Normal aortic diameter at the sinus level. Normal 
ascending aorta diameter. No 2D or Doppler evidence of distal 
arch coarctation. 
AORTIC VALVE: Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets (3). No AS. 
No AR. 
MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. Mild 
mitral annular calcification. No MS. ___ MR. ___ 
(>250ms) transmitral E-wave decel time. 
TRICUSPID VALVE: Tricuspid valve not well visualized. 
Indeterminate PA systolic pressure. 
PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflet. 
No PS. Physiologic PR. 
PERICARDIUM: There is an anterior space which most likely 
represents a fat pad, though a loculated anterior pericardial 
effusion cannot be excluded. 

Conclusions  
The left atrial volume index is moderately increased. The right 
atrium is moderately dilated. There is mild symmetric left 
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is 
normal. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion 
abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Overall left ventricular 
systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). The RV is not well seen, 
but overall function appears grossly normal. The aortic valve 
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not
present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve 
leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial mitral regurgitation is 
seen. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be 
determined. There is an anterior space which most likely 
represents a prominent fat pad. 

IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Mild symmetric left 
ventricular hypertrophy with preserved global biventricular 
systolic function. No clinically significant aortic or mitral 
valve disease is detected. Biatrial enlargement. The pulmonary 
artery systolic pressure could not be determined due to 
insufficient tricuspid regurgitation.

IMPRESSION:  
  
Lung volumes have improved, with only and moderate residual 
bibasilar 
atelectasis. Pulmonary vasculature is no longer engorged.

Brief Hospital Course:
He was admitted on ___ and was taken to the operating 
room.  He underwent coronary artery bypass grafting x 4. Please 
see operative note for full details.  He tolerated the procedure 
well and was transferred to the CVICU in stable condition for 
recovery and invasive monitoring. 
 
He weaned from sedation, awoke neurologically intact and was 
extubated on POD 1.  He was weaned from inotropic and 
vasopressor support. Beta blocker was initiated and he was 
diuresed toward his preoperative weight. He remained 
hemodynamically stable and was transferred to the telemetry 
floor for further recovery. He was evaluated by the physical 
therapy service for assistance with strength and mobility. By 
the time of discharge on POD #4 he was ambulating freely, the 
wound was healing, and pain was controlled with oral analgesics. 
He was discharged to home in good condition with appropriate 
follow up instructions.
