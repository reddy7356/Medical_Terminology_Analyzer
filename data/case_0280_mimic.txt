The patient presented with cramping and burning epigastric 
abdominal pain several days after receiving FOLFIRI (___), 
in the setting of a recent admission for the same reason. On her 
last admission, her pain was felt to be due to GERD vs. 
gastritis. She was discharged on BID high dose PPI, but her pain 
recurred despite this therapy. No signs of biliary or bowel 
obstruction, and admission CT abdomen/pelvis was unrevealing. GI 
was consulted, and they recommended conservative management, as 
endoscopy would not change management at this time. The patient 
was started on scheduled Zofran, resulting in improvement in her 
nausea, and her pain was managed with Tylenol, her home 
Oxycodone and MS ___, and Dilaudid for breakthrough pain. H. 
pylori stool antigen was detected and she was started on two

On admission, the patient also endorsed intermittent sensation 
of food and pills getting stuck in her throat. Improved with 
drinking fluids. No known prior endoscopy and no prior 
radiographic evaluation of esophagus. The patient underwent 
non-urgent barium swallow to assess for mechanical etiology, 
which showed no stricture. 

#Hypotension, thought to be ___ hypovolemia:
#Leukocytosis, thought to be ___ Neulasta:
The patient was intermittently hypotensive to ___ during 
admission, with improvement to ___ with bolusing. Suspected 
hypovolemia in the setting of dehydration given recent poor PO 
intake. The patient has been on Lovenox given h/o PE, but no e/o 
active bleeding. Despite leukocytosis, she did just receive 
Neulasta on ___. She has no localizing source of infection and
has been afebrile since arrival to the floor; therefore, low 
concern for sepsis.

Past Medical History:
PAST ONCOLOGY HISTORY
In brief, Prior Treatment: 
- Carboplatin/Etoposide ___ -> complete resolution
- ___ -> local recurrence
- Topotecan ___, 4 cycles
- PET/CT ___ with new liver mets and presacral soft tissue 
mass
- CAV for 2 cycles (___)

Per ___ Century Oncology in ___ records, Ms.
___ she was know in ___ began having pain
and bleeding in ___. Colonoscopy performed by Dr. 
___ at the ___ of the  ___ in ___ on ___ showed a 5-cm anterior anal
canal mass (also decribed as anorectal), with biopsy showing a
high-grade neuroendocrine carcinoma.  CT reportedly showed
numerous small liver lesions consistent with metastases.  She 
was
treated with cisplatin-etoposide by Dr. ___ with
initial response but then developed pain which led her to be
referred again to the radiation ocologist, Dr. ___, on
___.  He described that CT at ___'s ___
in ___ showed thickening of the rectum and adenopathy 
to
the left of the rectum.  She started topotecan after the CT with
dramatic reduction in her pain.  She received radiation therapy
to the rectum and anal-rectal mass from ___ to
___ (50.4 Gy in 28 fractions over 38 elapsed days
using IMRT with ___ MV photons).  The field sizes and treatment
borders were not reported in the summary. She appeared to have
good pain relief, though she still was using oxycodone when Dr.
___ saw her on ___.

Ms. ___ moved to ___ (where her brother and daughter
live) at some time this year.  She developed subacute left 
pelvic
and hip pain which radiated down the left leg.  She did not seek
medical care for this.  On ___ she developed acute 
chest
pain and shortness of breath and presented to the ___ ED in ___.  CXR there on the same day was
unremarkable, but chest CT-A revealed a pulmonary embolus in a
medial branch of the left lower lobe and a hepatic hypodensity. 
Lower extremity ultrasound on ___ was negative for DVT. She
was started on warfarin with a lovenox bridge.  CT of the 
abdomen
and pelvis on ___ reportedly showed numerous hypoattenuating
liver lesions, the largest 5 cm in the left hepatic lobe;
circumferential rectal thickening extending into presacral 
space;
prominent gonadal veins; and a fibroid uterus.  These images are
not available for our review at present.  On  ___,
CT-guided core biopsy of the left hepatic mass was performed,
which per the hospital discharge summary revealed high-grade
neuroendocrine tumor.  (She reports that she was told the biopsy
showed "small cell cancer.")  Transvaginal ultrasound on ___ revealed a fibroid uterus.  She was discharged on ___ on warfarin, oxycontin 10 mg bid, and dilaudid 2mg q4h,
apparently with plans for outpatient follow-up.  

Ms. ___  pelvic pain worsened and began to radiate down
the left leg after discharge.   She went to a local urgent care. 

No records are available from this visit, but she was apparently
prescribed toradol 10 mg q6h x 5 days; she took it for one day
with no relief. 

Ms. ___ went to the ___ ED on ___.
Examination there found ___ flexion/extension at the left ankle,
___ ___, and that she could "raise leg with difficulty".  Lumbar
___ radiographs were normal,   Lumbar ___ MRI  reportedly
showed a heterogenous enhancing soft tissue mass in the left
presacral region anterior to S2/S3 with direct bony invasion of
S2, encasing the left S1 and likely S2 nerve roots, with 
adjacent
5.1 x 3.4 x 3.5-cm and 1.6 x 1.3 x 1-cm masses just to the right
of this midline at S1. This imaging is not currently available
for review.  Ms. ___ was then transferred to ___ (her

IMAGING: 
======================
MR ___ - ___ - ___ - Loaded into life image
1) 5.1 x 3.4 x 3.4 cm left presacral mass at S1 and S2 with
contiguous bony involvement in the S1 vertebral body. The mass
encases the left S1 nerve root and likely the S2 nerve root as
well. Additional small presacral mass just to the right of the
midline at the S1 level measuring 1.6 cm. Finding likely reflect
metastatic disease in this patient with known history of cancer.
Primary sacral tumor such chordona of chonrosarcome could have
similar appearance. 
2) No significant abnormalities in the lumbar ___. No
degenerative disc disease or disc herniation. No spinal stenosis
or lumbar nerve root neural impingement. No0 epidural fluid
collections. 
3) multiple dominant liver masses, not completely evaluated by
this study consistent with provided history of metastatic 
cancer.

CHEST (PA & LAT) ___ 
No acute intrathoracic process.

CT ABDOMEN/PELVIS  ___ 
Numerous hepatic metastases, presacral mass and periportal 
adenopathy with
resulting mild common bile duct dilatation, likely reflecting 
metastatic
disease from rectal cancer.
 
CT CHEST ___. No evidence of intrathoracic metastasis.
2. Hepatic and perihepatic metastases which will be further 
detailed in the
dedicated abdomen/pelvis CT.

MRI ___ ___. No evidence of enhancing mass or abnormal enhancement to 
suggest metastatic
disease.
2. No evidence of acute infarction or intracranial hemorrhage.
 
MRI ___ ___. No evidence of osseous metastasis or enhancing soft tissue 
component.  No
evidence of cord compression.
2. Questionable non-enhancing short-segment focal spinal cord 
signal
abnormality at T9-T10 level.  This is unlikely to represent 
metastatic
disease.  Finding is nonspecific, and may represent infectious 
or inflammatory
process, or artifactual.  Attention on short-term follow-up 
examination is
recommended.
3. Re-demonstration of hepatic metastasis and periportal 
lymphadenopathy,
better assessed on recent CT abdomen and pelvis ___.
 
PATHOLOGY 
===================
Liver, needle core biopsy: ___
Metastatic high grade neuroendocrine carcinoma, small cell 
carcinoma type. See note.
Note: The tumor cells are immunoreactive for keratin, AE1/AE3, 
CAM5.2, TTF-1, and
synaptophysin. ___ proliferative index is almost 100%. The 
tumor cells are negative for
chromogranin and CDX2. PAX-8 is focally weakly positive. The 
findings are consistent with metastasis from the patient's known 
rectal neuroendocrine carcinoma. Prior pathology is not 
available for review. 

MICROBIOLOGY

- Topotecan ___, 4 cycles
- PET/CT ___ with new liver mets and presacral soft tissue
mass
- CAV for 2 cycles (___)
She presented with ongoing back pain and radicular pain with 
presacral mass with invasion of bone and liver metastases. 
Status post biopsy of liver met with results showing metastatic 
high grade neuroendocrine carcinoma, small cell carcinoma type, 
Ki-67 proliferative index is almost 100%. MRI head negative for 
metastasis. She was previously irradiated, and per radiation 
oncology, given the specifics of patient's prior radiation 
treatment and the location of her sacral lesion, she cannot 
safely receive additional radiation. 
During admission, she was re-initiated on chemotherapy as below: 

- carboplatin 4 AUC D1 [___]
- Etoposide 80mg/m2 D1,2,3 ___ - ___ 
- Neupogen D4 [___] - her ANC was 9.3 at discharge

# Subacute PE:
She had no dyspnea during admission. Patient was previously 
managed on warfarin. She was resumed on lovenox given 
malignancy. 

# Cancer related pain: Patient had low back pain and pelvic Pain 
from pre-sacral/vertebral metastasis S2-3. She was maintained on 
oxycontin in house, but her insurance did not cover it. 
Consequently, she was discharged on MS contin, with a bowel 
regimen. Interventional radiology will follow up with her to 
consider ablation of her presacral mass.

# HIV:
HIV1 positive, which is chronic for her since at least ___. 
Unable to perform genotyping as patient had negative viral load.

She has been generally adherent to this regimen and has not had 
h/o opportunitist infections. Dr. ___ records which were 
reviewed. On admission, Her CD4 was 114. Per ID, treatment was 
initiated with Dolutegravir + Truvada prior to starting 
chemotherapy. She was also started on bactrim single strength 
prior to the start of her cancer treatment. Toxo IgG positive 
and CMV IgG Positive, but did not require treatment per ID. 

#Chronic HBV: Patient with history of chronic HBV with positive 
core antibody. HBC viral load 2.9. The day after chemotherapy 
initiation, she developed worsening transaminitis, likely 
secondary to parenchymal disease v. chemo. Unlikely related to 
HBV in the setting of receiving chemo given HBV viral was stable 
at 2.9. Pt is on max therapy with Truvada and entacavir for HBV 
already per ID. HBe antigen positive indicating active hepatitis 
B infection, despite relatively low viral load. HBV genotyping 
is pending.

CHRONIC/STABLE PROBLEMS:

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,

You were admitted to the hospital because you were having 
worsening back pain. Unfortunately, we found that this was 
caused by your cancer spreading to your lower ___. The cancer 
has also spread to your liver. We did a biopsy of your liver

while you were in the hospital. You will continue these 
treatments as an outpatient. 

We set up an appointment with Dr. ___ will be your 
primary care doctor, ___ will be your oncologist, 
and with the infectious disease team. Please go to these 
appointments. 

We are also discharging you on new medications. Please take all 
of them as prescribed. We also asked the interventional 
radiology team to meet with you to see if you would benefit from 
a procedure (called an ablation) to reduce the pain from the 
cancer that spread to your bones (causing pain in your left 
buttock). They will call you to schedule an appointment. If you 
don't hear from them by the end of this week, please call them 
to make an appointment at ___.

palliative chemo s/p C4D1 Folfiri on ___ (Neulasta ___ with
Hep B, HIV, and hx of PE on lovenox presents with abdominal 
pain,
nausea and PO intolerance in the setting of CT abdomen finding 
of
progression of liver metastasis and small rim enhancing 
abscesses
x2 on the right abdominal wall. Remained afebrile off 
antibiotics and deep abdominal abscess aspirated by ___. Cultures 
with negative gram stain and no growth over 24 hours. 
Superficial abdominal fluid collection more consistent with 
inflammatory granulomatous changes from lovenox injection and no 
pain on palpation. Abdominal pain improved with home 
oxycontin/oxycodone and intermittent IV dilaudid. She had a 
bowel movement with methylnaltrexone that significantly improved 
pain.

Acute Issues:
===================
#Abdominal abscess vs fluid collection
CT abdomen with 2cm fluid collection in LL anterior abdominal 
wall
likely from lovenox injection. Imaging also with 2.7 cm rim 
enhancing collection deep to mid abdominal mesh (hernia repair 
surgery in ___ ___. Fluid concerning for an abscess 
though patient without fevers and HD stable. She had 
leukocytosis iso of neulasta on ___ that downtrended during 
hospital stay. ID consulted with recommendation to hold off on 
antibiotics pending results of ___ drainage. CT guided aspiration 
of deep fluid collection with negative gram stain and no growth 
on cultures for 24 hrs. Remained HD stable and afebrile on 
discharge and no antibiotics were given. 

#Abdominal pain: 
#Nausea/PO intolerance 
Unclear etiology with acute onset of pain in the RUQ/epigastric
area as well as lower abdominal wall. Normal lipase and no
evidence of new biliary dilatation on CT abdomen. No evidence of
obstruction and patient passing gas. CT A/P with evidence of
progression of liver metastasis as well as presacral mass on
current chemo regimen. No compression of celiac plexus on 
imaging.
Concern for possible peptic ulcer given epigastric pain iso of 
previous
positive H.pylori s/p treatement in ___. Repeat stool 
antigen sent and pending on discharge. Abdominal pain improved 
after drainage of fluid collection and following bowel movement 
with methylnaltrexone. Able to tolerate PO and pain well managed 
on home Morphine SR 30mg BID, oxycodone 5 Q4hr PRN, and 
Gabapentin 300mg QHS. 

#Leukocytosis: 
Likely due to Neulasta on ___ and downtrended to normal range 
during hospitalization. Afebrile at home and no recorded fevers 
inpatient
without focal symptoms. Urine, blood, and fluid collection 
aspiration without growth. 

#Metastatic neuroendocrine carcinoma 
#Bone metastasis
Metastatic disease to presacrum with bone involvement of S2/S3. 
Treated with palliative intent with Folfiri given progression
through multiple lines of chemotherapy previously. Initially
localized and underwent treatment in ___ with carboplatin 
and
etoposide from ___ to ___ and then with topotecan for
three cycles and radiation for local recurrence in ___
with progression in ___ on CAV after that point with
unclear response. Progressed through carboplatin and etoposide 
at
___ and now on palliataive Folfiri though has missed multiple
doses of the medication. Now with progression of liver 
metastasis
as well as pre-sacral mass. After discussion of CT results with 
Dr. ___ expressed wish to pursue treatment which 
would likely include docetaxel. She will also likely have 
foundation one testing for potential molecular targets as 
outpatient 

#Opioid induced constipation
Had been constipated despite docusate, senna, bisacodyl PO and 
Miralax daily at home. Received methylnaltrexone on ___ with 
large BM that significantly improved abdominal pain. Evaluated 
by palliative care. Will consider possible methylnaltrexone as 
outpatient to help regular bowel movements. Discharged with 
increase senna to 2 tablets BID, and daily miralax BID and 
bisacodyl PR in addition to home regimen. 

#Hep B/HIV- 
Last CD4 count 159 on ___. Received neulasta on ___ that 
may interfere with results of repeat CD4 sent that are pending 
on discharge. Continued on home dolutregravir and Truvada as 
well as SS Bactrim daily. 

#H/o PE in ___ and started on Lovenox. Continued on home 
Lovenox 60mg BID. 

#H/o Orthostatic hypotension- Continued on home Midodrine 5mg 
daily

currently on C2D18 FOLFIRI who was admitted with pleuritic chest 

pain, acute on chronic hip pain, and an isolated fever. 

# Acute on Chronic L gluteal Pain: Patient has chronic left hip 
and 
lower back pain with radiation down the left leg. This is been 
previously attributed to her neuroendocrine sacral mass. Given 
her elevated chromogranin MR imaging was pursued for evaluation 
of her pain symptoms which showed stable disease. Long 
acting opioids were up-titrated while in house and treated with 
PRN. 

# Pleuritic chest pain: Patient describes pain at left 
anterolateral ribs. Precipitated by torso twisting, direct 
palpation, and coughing, was sudden onset driving but different 
than her prior epigastric pain from last admission. PE ruled 
out by CTA in the ED, EKG is nonischemic, and serial troponins 
were negative. Pain is reproducible on exam that was thought to 
be due to musculoskeletal in origin. By the time patient arrived 
on floor she was able to breathe normally without having any 
pain symptoms with coughing and deep inhalation as well as 
twisting. Treated with analgesia including Toradol for suspected 
MSK origin.

# Fever: Patient did not have any fevers prehospital, but did 
have a temperature of 101.5 in the emergency department. Septic 
eval was negative, she did not have any further temperatures, 
had no leukocytosis, and so antibiotics were discontinued when 
she 
arrived on the floor. He did not have any focal features and 
did not have any recurrent temperatures.

# Metastatic Neuro-Endocrine Tumor: C2D1 F___ was ___. CT 
imaging showed unchanged innumerable hematic mets and abdominal 
adenopathy. Chromogranin level on admission was 668 - her 
highest recorded value despite recent chemo. MRI of the hip and 
pelvis showed stable disaease. Dr ___ is her outpatient 
oncologist and wanted to continue her chemotherapy while 
hospitalized. She was started on C2D1 FOLFIRI ___. 

# Orthostatic Hypotension: 
She experienced lower blood pressure while receiving 
chemotherapy. While this is not commonly seen with this regimen, 
patient reports that this has happened with
previous chemotherapy. She is asymptomatic with normal mentation 
and
significant urine output. ___ be secondary to nausea and poor PO
intake. Etiology unclear, may be chemotherapy affect or 
component of adrenal insufficiency though AM cortisol is wnl. 
She was started on midodrine. 

# H. Pylori: Diagnosed last admission. Continue triple 
therapy(with H2RA) through ___.

# HBV/HIV: Continue home dolutregravir and Truvada. 
# History of PE: Cont home lovenox 

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
[ ] Patient will need close follow up for pain management
[ ] Patient hypotensive during admission but asymptomatic, 
started on midodrine. Evaluate need for continuation of 
midodrine.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ is a ___ lady with metastatic neuroendocrine 
tumor, HIV, HBV, and GERD, who presented with abdominal, chest, 
and back pain in the setting of recently starting chemotherapy. 

#Epigastric pain
Pt presented with epigastric pain radiating to the back. ED 
workup did not show evidence of ACS, PE, aortic dissection, PTX, 
or pancreatitis to explain her pain. Most likely GERD (given 
location) given improvement in her symptoms with Maalox. Patient 
takes omeprazole 20 mg daily at home, increased to 20 mg BID. 
Refused famotidine, citing prior stomach pain with it. Less 
likely to be from bone pain from neulasta given improvement 
overnight, deferred starting Claritin. H pylori stool antigen 
was sent lab but not pending on discharge. Consider testing if 
patient does not improve with trial of omeprazole. 

#Chronic pain on chronic opioids: Continued home MS contin and 
oxycodone. 

#Chronic constipation: Started standing bowel regimen with 
miralax and senna as constipation likely worsening abdominal 
symptoms. Counseled to dc senna if having frequent BMs.

#Neuroendocrine carcinoma
Known liver and pre-sacral mets. Pt started C2D1 of ___ 
+ neulasta on ___ at ___. Has outpt f/u scheduled w Dr. 
___. 

#Hx PE: continued home lovenox 70mcg BID

#HIV, HVB: chronic, stable, continued home Truvada and Tivicay +

appear centrally necrotic, grossly unchanged compared to the 
prior examination. There is no evidence of intrahepatic or 
extrahepatic biliary dilatation. The gallbladder is within 
normal limits. PANCREAS: The pancreatic body and tail are 
severely atrophic. The pancreatic head is unremarkable in 
appearance without focal lesions or ductal dilatation. No 
peripancreatic stranding. SPLEEN: The spleen shows normal size 
and attenuation throughout, without evidence of focal lesions.
