History of Present Illness:
Ms. ___ right-handed woman with history of right cavernous
carotid aneurysm status post clipping in ___ by Dr. ___ at
___ with recent admission to neurosurgery from ___ for
headaches with subarachnoid hemorrhage and left thalamic 
infarct,
with normal diagnostic angiogram.  She presents to ED today with
new left-sided sensory symptoms, for which neurology is
consulted.

Regarding her recent admission, Ms. ___ presented with ___
months of headache which is worsened, emesis and right hemibody
sensory changes.  NCHCT showed right convexal subarachnoid
hemorrhage.  Given her history of cerebral aneurysm there is
concerned that this may represent an aneurysmal subarachnoid
hemorrhage, and she underwent diagnostic angiogram on ___, 
which
was unremarkable.  There was also concern that this may 
represent
RCVS, and she was started on verapamil.

Her new baseline deficits include right hemifacial numbness in
the V1-V3 distributions, right tongue paresthesias, right buccal
numbness, right hand numbness and paresthesiae extending
proximally, worse medially than laterally.  She also experiences
numbness and paresthesia of digits 345 on her right foot and 
some
paresthesia along the lateral aspect of her right lower leg.  
She
thinks that she has some clumsiness of her right arm, and notes
that she will sometimes crush or knock over a cup that she is
trying to pick up.
She also has a near-constant headache, typically right
hemicranium.  

Ms. ___ had a clinic visit with Dr. ___, who
told her that he felt that the etiology of her presentation was
still possibly RCVS, and he wanted to speak to Dr. ___ to see
what additional tests were needed and when.  She had been taking
Tylenol scheduled throughout the day to reach maximum dose of 4 
g
daily, and Dr. ___ her to decrease that to total daily
dose of 3 g.  Documentation of the clinic visit is not available
at this time.
She also had a cardiology appointment today for follow-up of
troponin anemia on presentation, and was told that "everything
seems okay" and that he would consider performing a stress test
in a few months.
Her scheduled follow-up with neurosurgery has not yet occurred.

Regarding her presentation today, she reports that throughout 
the
majority of the day she felt slightly more tired than usual.  At
approximately ___, after eating dinner, she stood up and felt
"odd".  She then sat back down and felt numbness/tightness of 
her
left face.  She looked in the mirror and noted that her left 
face
was not moving well.  Slightly less than an hour later she noted
paresthesia and numbness of her left thumb.  She presented to 
OSH
ED where ___ was performed, and revealed no acute hemorrhage. 
She states that her symptoms continue to evolve after that 
point,
and that the numbness in her face spread to involve her left lip
during transfer from OSH to ___.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,
You were hospitalized due to symptoms of L face and hand 
numbness concerning for an ACUTE ISCHEMIC STROKE, a condition 
where a blood vessel providing oxygen and nutrients to the brain 
is blocked by a clot. The brain is the part of your body that 
controls and directs all the other parts of your body, so damage 
to the brain from being deprived of its blood supply can result 
in a variety of symptoms.
Stroke can have many different causes, so we assessed you for 
medical conditions that might raise your risk of having stroke. 
In order to prevent future strokes, we plan to modify those risk 
factors. Your risk factors are:
high blood pressure
previous strokes
We are changing your medications as follows:
Please increase Verapamil to 120mg in the morning and 180mg in 
the evening. Please work with ___ as an outpatient. Please do not 
engage in high-intensity exercise but light exercise is fine. 
Please take your other medications as prescribed.
Please followup with Neurology and your primary care physician.
If you experience any of the symptoms below, please seek 
emergency medical attention by calling Emergency Medical 
Services (dialing 911). In particular, since stroke can recur, 
please pay attention to the sudden onset and persistence of 
these symptoms:
- Sudden partial or complete loss of vision
- Sudden loss of the ability to speak words from your mouth
- Sudden loss of the ability to understand others speaking to 
you
- Sudden weakness of one side of the body
- Sudden drooping of one side of the face
- Sudden loss of sensation of one side of the body

Sincerely,
Your ___ Neurology Team
