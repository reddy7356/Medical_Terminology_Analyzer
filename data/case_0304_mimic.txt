Diarrhea: Pt admitted for 10 days of diarrhea, no fever, chills, 
nausea, vomiting. On arrival his initial vitals were T 97.0 HR 
78 BP 104/53 R 18 and satting 98% on roomair. He received 1L NS 
in the ED and was transferred to the floor. He was made NPO, and 
continued on fluids. His diarrhea largely resolved without PO 
intake; although he still reported stooling somewhat more 
frequently than usual, he had no urgency and no loss of bowel 
control. Patient was started on a clear diet, and his diarrhea 
returned, although still not at the same volume he reported 
having at home -- ___ loose stools over 24 hours, one with loss 
of bowel control. He was seen by GI, who felt his diarrhea was 
unlikely infectious, and advised a lactose free diet to rule out 
lactose intolerance; also recommended outpatient follow up to 
investigate question of carcinoid, stomach polyps found on EGD 
at outside hospital. Stool studies were sent and came back 
negative for C diff, giardia, and vibrio. O&P pending on 
discharge, now negative. Chromogranin and 24 hour urine for 
5-HIAA drawn for question of carcinoid, still pending. Pt was 
amenable to outpatient follow up with ___ gastroenterology to 
avoid complications of having records at 2 hospitals. As C diff 
was negative he was started on loperamide to control symptoms, 
and sent out in improved condition to follow up with his PCP and 
his gastroenterologist. 

#Oral ulcers: unclear etiology. Patient has had biopsies showing 
squamous dysplasia, unclear etiology. Question of HSV or 
candidal esophagitis. Possible food reaction, as seems to be 
irritated by various acidic foods. Treated with oral viscous 
lidocaine, recommended outpatient follow-up with GI. 

#AOCKD: Cr on admission was 4.7. Close to recent baseline. Lasix 
held on admission. Patient was seen by nephrology, who confirmed 
that patient does not currently need hemodialysis. 

#DM2: Pt placed on insulin sliding scale, blood glucose well 
controlled during stay. 

#OSA. Patient used CPAP during stay, stated he preferred the 
mask he was given as inpatient over his own, and was invited to 
take it home with him on discharge, which he did. 

#Paroxysmal Afib. Patient not on warfarin owing to history of 
calciphylaxis. Lopressor and ASA/plavix were continued. 

#Gout. Allopurinol was continued; pt did not have flare during 
his stay. 

#Transitional- Patient was sent out on seven day course of 
sodium bicarb for renal failure. Also, issue of HIV was raised 
given patient's oral ulcers suggestive of HSV or candidal 
esophagitis, patient was resistant to testing; issue could be 
raised again in outpatient environment.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___, It was a pleasure taking care of you during 
your stay at ___. You were 
admitted for diarrhea. We treated you with IV fluids, and 
encouraged you not to eat for several hours. We ran tests, some 
of which are still pending and will be followed up by your out 
patient provider; however, your tests for intestinal infections 
were negative. You remained stable, and your diarrhea resolved. 
You were seen by a gastroenterology team, who felt you could 
benefit from an outpatient workup. You were also seen by a 
nephrology team, who determined that you still are not yet in 
need of hemodialysis. They also recommended that you eliminate 
lactose (dairy) from your diet for a while to determine if your 
diarrhea may be caused by lactose intolerance. You were 
discharged with a medication to help slow down your bowel 
movements to follow up with one of our outpatient 
gastroenterologists.

is scheduled for repeat biopsy next week with them as 
outpatient. 

He was also admitted to ___ for the diarrhea roughly ___ 
months ago and was found to have elevated 5-HIAA (1000). He is 
followed by GI who recommended repeat colonoscopy and EGD for 
the persistent diarrhea and further work-up of ?carcinoid. Pt

Brief Hospital Course:
___ y/o M with CKD (with AV-fistula, no HD yet), CVA (___), 
obesity, p/w ___ swelling/weakness x 2 weeks and sore on R ___ 
toe x several days. He developed abdominal pain in house, and 
enzymes were concerning for pancreatitis. He is s/p ERCP on 
___. 

# Chronic Kidney Disease: Patient is followed by Dr. ___ as 
an outpatient and on admission was noted to have a creatinine 
improved from baseline.  He continued to make normal amounts of 
urine. Renal followed the patient while he was hospitalized. He 
was placed on low K/low phos/low Na diet. Cinacalcet was held 
___ low ionized Ca while inpatient. His sevelamer was decreased 
and sodium bicarbonate was started per renal recommendations.    


 
# DVT: Patient was noted to have a DVT of the left superficial 
femoral and popliteal veins and thrombus in right posterior 
tibial and peroneal veins. With his history of CKD and 
calciphylaxis with coumadin, his options for anticoagulation 
were limited. Hematology was consulted and recommended heparin 
drip. When stable PTT, place patient on subcutaneous therapeutic 
heparin for long term home anticoagulation.  The patient was 
placed on 25,000U of subcutaneous heparin BID with most recent 
PTTs of 58.0 and 87.0. Hematology was reassured with these PTTs 
and the patient was discharged home with a prescription for 
25,000U BID of SCH.  He will require PTT monitoring once per 
week, which will be arranged through his PCP.   

#Pancreatitis: On HD1, patient developed diffuse abdominal ___, 
particularly in the epigastric region concerning for SBO vs. 
Pancreatitis vs. Cholecystitis. Ciprofloxacin and Flagyl were 
started. He was noted to have an elevated lipase, alk phos, 
tbili, and transaminases. He also developed mild leukocytosis. 
CT findings were consistent with cholelthiasis and mild 
pancreatitis. His symptoms resolved overnight with IVF and bowel 
rest. He underwent ERCP ___ with sphincteroplasty, which 
showed sludge and small stone fragments in CBD. Ciprofloxacin 
and Flagyl were discontinued. He remained asymptomatic, 
afebrile, and tolerated a regular diet. He will discuss with his 
PCP possible future follow up with general surgery to discuss 
potential cholecystectomy at a later date.   
 
# right second toe erytema/history of PVD: Patient presented 
with ulcer and surrounding erythema on R ___ toe with x-ray 
findings concerning for osteomyelitis. Podiatry reviewed the 
films and examined the patient. They felt osteomyeltitis was 
unlikely, particularly in setting of normal WBC, CRP,andESR. He 
was continued on IV vancomycin for cellulitis. Blood cultures 
were negative. On ___, vancomycin was discontinued and 
clindamycin and ciprofloxacin PO were started. The erythema 
remained stable. It was thought that the erythema could 
represent an arterial ulcer, the patient was instructed to 
follow up with his PCP for possible referral to vascular surgery 
as an outpatient for further workup and treatment given his 
history of PVD.  The patient is currently on therapeutic 
heparin, currently holding his Plavix. He will need to discuss 
with his PCP ___ to resume Plavix.         

# Lower Extremity Weakness: Patient presented with acute on 
chronic weakness of the ___. Notes baseline left ___ weakness ___ 
CVA many years ago. However, on admission he had decreased 
strength and difficulty using leg in setting of increased edema. 
With ___ and improvement of edema with heparin therapy, patient's 
symptoms improved and he returned to baseline. 

# Weight loss/Anorexia: Persistent weight loss and anorexia ___ 
year with reported loss of around 100lbs ___ pain with 
swallowing and oral lesions. Concerning for underlying 
malignancy in setting of other symptoms including malaise, oral

Consider whether this needs to be re-initiated, however we 
stopped it during this hospitalization.
- sevelamer was decreased per renal recommendations from 1600mg 
TID to ___ TID
- pt had been previously prescribed triamcinolone cream for 
tongue lesions; in light of prior dysplasia seen on biopsy this 
was discontinued
- Pt was previously taking aspirin 325 and this was decreased to 
81mg daily
