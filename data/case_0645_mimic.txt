KUB ___: 
 
Brief Hospital Course:
This is a ___ yo man with severe COPD, recent hospitalization, 
with acute exacerbation, also with abdominal pain.  
  
1. Shortness of breath: Suspect underlying COPD exacerbation 
triggered by inhalation of tobacco. However, given mildly 
elevated WBC and the vital sign abnormalities noted at home the 
morning of presentation I favored treating for infection despite 
lack of change in sputum, fevers, xray findings. Cardiac 
etiology also considered but no chages noted and two sets of 
cardiac markers negative so this seemed  unlikelly. He was 
treated with solumedrol on HD 1, then prednisone 40mg HD with 
rapid taper to prednisone 30mg on HD 3 given he returned to 
baseline and stayed there within a few hours. Though he was 
stable for discharge on HD2, he was nervous to go home so we 
monitored him for 1 extra day. His sat remained low to mid 90's 
on ___ NC, with sat of 88%-92% on 3L NC with ambulation. He was 
also treated with azithromycin for a 5 day course.  He was again 
encouraged to quit smoking and reminded of the very severe 
consequences of smoking on oxygen.
  
2. Abdominal pain: This was noted on admit but he did not have 
this during the remainder of his course.  The etiology was 
unclear due to the vague nature and lack of recurrence, however 
a KUB was obtained to r/o occult perforation given his high dose 
prednisone, which only showed stool.  It was thought that 
constipation could be contributing given the stool on KUB so 
lactulose was added.

3. Urinary retention: Mr. ___ complained of difficulty passing 
urine at night, even with standing to void. He had a urinalysis 
checked that was normal, culture pending at time of discharge. 
He had a post-void bladder scan that initially showed 300cc but 
once encouraged to fully empty his bladder showed only 150. We 
discussed the potential etiologies for this, most likely being 
benign prostatic hypertrophy vs. constipation (or both) as there 
were no medications he was getting that were likely to be 
contributing. We discussed starting ___ to help but he 
favored treating the constipation and following up with his pcp 
as an outpatient to further discuss this issue and the 
treatment. He also had a psa that was checked and low at 0.3.

4. Diabetes melitus: He was noted to have poorly controlled 
blood glucose on steroids while in the hospital. He was 
continued on metformin and glyburide, with sliding scale for 
additional coverage.  

5. Hypertension: Controlled on home lisinopril and lasix.  

6. Hyperlipidemia: Controlled on home simvastatin.  
  
7. Anemia: He was noted to be anemic on admission but stable 
during his stay, normocytic, vitamin b12 and folate were checked 
and noted to be replete.   
 
8. Glaucoma: He was continued on home xalatan and ___ 
drops.  
 
9. Vitamin B12 deficiency: He was noted to miss his usual 
monthly injection on date of admission so was given the dose in 
the hospital.

10. Code: Confirmed full.

CXR:
Mild cardiomegaly and the mediastinal contours are stable. 
Airspace opacity at the left lung base appears to have worsened 
and is concerning for early/developing pneumonia. Apparent 
prominence of the interstitial markings of the lower lungs is 
probably due to relative attenuation of the upper lung 
vasculature secondary to emphysema. There is no pleural effusion 
on this radiograph that does not fully include the right 
costophrenic sulcus. There is no pneumothorax. The bones are 
unchanged.
IMPRESSION:
1. Findings concerning for early/developing pneumonia of the 
left lung base.
2. Emphysema.
.
ECHO:
 The left atrium is mildly dilated. The estimated right atrial 
pressure is ___ mmHg. There is mild symmetric left ventricular 
hypertrophy with normal cavity size. There is mild regional left 
ventricular systolic dysfunction with mild inferior wall 
hypokinesis. Overall left ventricular systolic function is low 
normal (LVEF 50-55%). Right ventricular chamber size is normal. 
with borderline normal free wall function. The aortic valve 
leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet 
excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets 
are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. 
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There 
is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion. 
.
Spirometry ___:
Mechanics: The FVC is moderately reduced, while the FEV1/FVC 
ratio and FEV1 is severely reduced.  Flow-Volume Loop: Marked 
expiratory coving and abrupt termination of   exhalation with 
reduced volume excursion. 
Impression: Marked obstructive ventilatory defect. The reduced 
FVC may reflect gas trapping. Although a concurrent restrictive 
process cannot be ruled out.  Since ___, FVC decrased 470cc 
(18%), and FEV1 by 250cc (29%).

ECHO ___:
1. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left 
ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50-55%). 
Inferior hypokinesis is probably present.
2. Compared with the findings of the prior report (tape 
unavailable for review) of ___, there has been no 
significant change.  

 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ yo male with DMII, severe COPD (FEV1/FVC 43% predicted) on 
home O2, h/o intubation and continuous smoking p/w acute onset 
shortness of breath, HTN, and fever to 103.
.
# SOB and h/o COPD: acute onset at night, but similar in nature 
to past episodes but this time did not resolve with inhalers.  
Currently pt reports he is back to his baseline.  His 
oxygenation improved with lasix 80mg IVxonce in the ED and pt's 
blood pressure decreased. CXR showed possible PNA.  Therefore 
the most likely etiologies are COPD exacerbation from acute 
bacterial pneumonia versus CHF/flash pul edema.  Pt last had 
echo in ___ that was suboptimal, but BNP at that time was 38 
versus almost 1000 this admission. Acute coronary syndrome must 
also be considered, but EKG did not show any ischemic changes 
and cardiac enzymes negative x 3. Pt also has appearance of 
likely sleep apnea which may be exacerbating his breathing as 
well as his hypertension. PE unlikely given pt's rapid 
improvement with diuresis, antibiotics and steroids, but if 
respiratory function declines, may need to consider CTA. Pt also 
has very strong risk for developing lung cancer and extensive 
smoking history. Most likely explanation again is PNA with COPD 
exacerbation.  The patient was started on levofloxacin and 
received a steroid pulse with slow taper to his home dose of 
10mg prednisone every other day.  His home lasix dose was 
increased to 40mg daily but echo did not confirm significant CHF 
with slightly depressed EF and normal diastolic function. He was 
stable on his home O2 dose of 3L.  He is encouraged to stop 
smoking. 
.
# fever: likely ___ pulmonary process (CAP).  Pt does have URI 
symptoms but doubt that this is influenza.  U/a negative, blood 
cultures were positive in one anaerobic bottle for PORPHYROMONAS 
SPECIES.    BETA LACTAMASE POSITIVE. This is likely from an 
oropharyngeal source.  ID was curbsided who recommended flagyl 
for a 2 week course in addition to levofloxacin.  The patient is 
edentulous but mouth flora could still have been aspirated, for 
instance. He did not show any signs of sepsis this 
hospitalization and will follow-up with his PCP.  His fevers 
resolved after initiation of levofloxacin.
.
# PUMP: ?CHF given increased BNP, no clear e/o volume overload 
on exam but pt did respond well to lasix. Pt had marked HTN in 
ED which may be influenced by ?sleep apnea. Echo ___ did not 
show clear cardiac dysfunction.  He was continued on his 
outpatient ace inhibitor and was started on a beta blocker.  
Echo showed slightly depressed EF.  
.
# CAD: pt does not have past stress test, LDL < 100 on very 
low-dose statin.  Pt takes daily aspirin.  He also has diabetes. 
 First 2 sets show unlikely ACS.  will continue to trend but no 
further work-up indicated.  Echo did not show any evidence of 
prior ischemia.
.
# RHYTHM: tachycardic at admission, could be from albuterol, 
pain, anxiety.  His heart rate normalized.
.
# DMII: Hgb A1C 6.5.  Pt is on glipizide and metformin.  The 
steroids caused a significant increase in his blood sugars to 
300s.  His outpatient medications were restarted and he was 
placed on a sliding scale.  His fingersticks will likely improve 
off steroids.  He will f/u with his PCP.

Final Report 
CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___ 
  
Comparison made with a prior study from ___. 
  
CLINICAL HISTORY: COPD, four days of increasing cough. Question 
pneumonia. 
  
FINDINGS: PA and lateral views of the chest are obtained. The 
lungs are 
hyperexpanded with a widened AP diameter and flattened 
diaphragms likely 
related to underlying COPD. There is blunting at the right CP 
angle which may 
be related to pleural thickening or a small effusion. Heart size 
is enlarged. 
There is no overt CHF. Irregularity along the diaphragmatic 
surface on the 
frontal projection may be related to small eventrations. There 
is no 
pneumothorax. Bony structures are intact. 
  
IMPRESSION: Emphysema, cardiomegaly, small right effusion. No 
gross change 
from prior study. 
  
___. ___ 
___: ___ 3:49 ___ 
 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ is a ___ year old man with severe COPD, on 4L by NC 
chronically, admitted ___ with labored breathing.  Per the 
admit note, he was inadvertenly taking the wrong dose of 
prednisone and continues to smoke a small quantity of 
cigarettes.  He has shown improvement with nebulizers, steroids 
and oxygen as well as levofloxacin.  Pulmonary consultation was 
obtained and agreed with plan of care as outlined below.  On 
___, patient's BUN/Cr were elevated (climbing to 1.2 from 0.7 
on admission).  PO fluids were encouraged, he was given 250 cc 
NS bolus.  His furosemide and lisinoprl were discontinued.  This 
will need to be resumed pending renal improvement.

Problem list:
## AECOPD, Steroid/oxygen dependent  
## Type 2 DM - uncontrolled  
## Anemia NOS  
## Hypertension  
## Chronic diastolic heart failure  
## glaucoma  
## GERD  
## Osteoporosis  
## psoriasis  
## chronic non-healing ulceration of lower extremity  
## probable malnutrition 
## psoriasis 

PLAN:
## Continue oxygen, steroids with slow taper.  Decreased from 60 
mg of prednisone on ___ to 55 mg of prednisone.  He should NOT 
be lowered below 20 mg of prednisone daily. Will complete 
levofloxacin on ___. Continue PCP ___.  Spiriva 
will need to be resumed per ___ rec's on discharge.
## ___ Consult appreciated for diabetes management.  Was 
managed on metformin and glyburide as well as a humalog sliding 
scale.  ___ recommended NO INSULIN on discharge to home as 
the steroid taper continues.  His Glyburide was changed to 
Glipizide since it has a shorter duration of action and Mr. 
___ tends to have high sugars during the day but not at night.
## continue BP control for chronic dCHF.  Will need to resume 
furosemide when intravascular volume depletion is improved.  
Consider checking for urine eosinophils.  Urine electrolytes 
will be less useful until ___ as he has been on furosemide.
## eye gtt  
## continue calcium/Vit D supplementation  
## MVI, nutritional supplements  
## PPI
## creams as per Derm for Psoriasis

negative for an acute pulmonary process and recieved 125 mg IV 
Solumedrol in ED for presumed COPD exacerbation.  On admission 
to the floor, Mr. ___ was started on Prednisone 60mg PO daily. 
 No PCP prophylaxis was started.  Ipratropium was discontinued

was low probability for DVT and his negative ___ dopplers were 
felt to rule him out for PE.  He was started on 5-day course of 
Azithromycin due to report of increased cough.  Mr. ___ oxygen 
requirment remained at his baseline throughout admission.  On 
day of discharge, his breathing was at his baseline and he was

pulmonary edema. Trace right pleural effusion.

CXR ___: Relatively symmetric ground-glass opacification in 
the lower lung zones is most likely pulmonary edema. Heart is 
normal size. The mediastinal veins are distended. Left jugular 
vein ends in the upper SVC. Lung bases are excluded from the 
examination. Upper pleural margins show no abnormality, but some 
pleural effusion could be present.

EKG: Artifact is present. Sinus tachycardia. Probably normal 
tracing. Compared to the previous tracing there is no 
significant change.
 
Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ is a ___ year-old male smoker with a history of severe 
COPD on home oxygen (4L), DM2, and diastolic heart failure who 
presented to the ICU from home (after a brief stay at rehab 
following recent hospitalization) with dyspnea and respiratory 
failure.  Due to worsening respiratory effort he was intubated 
in the field, transported to the emergency department and 
admitted to the ICU.
.
1. Hypoxic/hypercapneic respiratory failure:  His respiratory 
failure was felt to be secondary to pneumonia complicated by 
COPD exacerbation. Mr. ___ has history of multiple COPD 
exacerbations and pneumonia episodes in past, for which he has 
been intubated, and he continues to smoke.  He presented to the 
ICU on ___, intubated with ABG consistent with chronic 
respiratory acidosis. He was started on empiric vancomycin and 
zosyn for hospital-acquired pneumonia (given recent 
hospitalization and rehab stay) as well as azithromycin for 
atypical coverage.  His antibiotics were eventually switched to 
Levaquin after a bronchoalveolar lavage culture grew 
stenotrophomonas maltophilia that was sensitive to Levaquin.  He 
was started on tamiflu empirically, and had a flu swab that 
later returned negative and his Tamiflu was discontinued. He was 
extubated on ___ without complication.  He was initially on 
high dose solumedrol IV which was transitioned to prednisone 60 
mg po daily. Per Dr. ___ pulmonologist), he 
should continue this dose of prednisone until he his seen in 
clinic.  He completed a 9 day course of levaquin for his 
hospital acquired Stenotrophomonas pneumonia. At time of 
discharge patient is requiring albuterol nebs q3h and 
ipratropium nebs q6h to prevent acute exacerbation.  Patient 
would also likely benefit a great deal by BiPAP.  He was seen by 
Respiratory Therapy on the medical floor and started on 
intermittent BiPAP. Recommend continuing to offer BiPAP for 
intermittent relief and throughout night. Smoking cessation 
(reportedly has not smoked since ___ hospital admission) was 
congratulated and abstinence encouraged.  Patient is scheduled 
to follow up with Dr. ___ in clinic on ___ to address 
prednisone taper.
.
2. Acute Renal insufficiency:  Mr. ___ has a baseline 
Creatinine of 0.7 which was elevated on admission to 1.7.  His 
creatinine trended downward (1.0) during his ___ hospital course 
in response to IV fluid. The underlying etiology for ARF on 
presentation was felt to be pre-renal in the setting of 
pneumonia. With later diuresis on the medicine floor for volume 
overload his creatinine fell to 0.8. suggesting his diastolic 
dysfunction is a considerable contributor to compromised renal 
function. 
.
3. Hypertension: After receiving IV fluids and high dose 
steroids for his pneumonia and COPD, he became hypertensive.  He 
was restarted on his home amlodipine which was increased to 10mg 
po daily.  He was also restarted on lisinopril 40 mg po daily 
and lasix 60 mg po daily (discontinued on previous admission in 
setting of ARF). 
.
4. Diastolic CHF: Patient appeared volume overloaded on 
presentation to the medicine floor.  Lasix was restarted and 
patient was diuresed > 3 L.  Renal function improved with 
diuresis. Continue antihypertensive regimen as listed about. 
Recommend compression stockings and leg elevation to reduce 
lower extremity edema.  
.
5. Sinus Tachycardia: Persists throughout admission. Likely 
secondary to frequent albuterol nebs and respiratory distress.  
If tolerated attempt to decrease frequency of albuterol nebs to 
decrease tachycardia and allow greater diastolic filling.
.
6. CODE STATUS: Patient stated that he no longer would like to 
be intubated on ___.  However, he would not like this to 
take effect until he has discussed this with his family.  He 
plans to meet with his family on ___ to notify them of this 
change.  Please verify code status with patient after his family 
discussion.

Brief Hospital Course:
___ yo M with multiple medical problems most notable for severe 
COPD with multiple hospitalizations for flares presents with 
another COPD exacerbation after finsishing a brief Prednisone 
taper from last hospitalization two days prior.
.
# COPD exacerbation: Patient with severe (Stage IV) COPD and 
many recent flares on 4L O2 at home presents with repeat COPD 
exacerbation.  Most likely cause of flare is insufficient 
Prednisone coverage on his short taper. Patient received 
Combivent on the way to the ED, and in the ED was placed on 4L 
NC, given 60mg IV salumedrol x1, duoneb x3, albuterol nebulizer 
x1, and azithromycin 500mg x1. On the floor he received 
Prednisone 60mg, albuterol neb Q4 standing, Ipratropium Bromide 
Q6 standing, Fluticasone Diskus BID, and albuterol Q2 PRN.  
Initial blood gas showed a pH of 7.35 pO2 69 and pCO2 58.  
Patient was also placed on a 5 day course of Azithromycin and 
started on Atovaquone 1500mcg for PCP ___. His breathing 
improved to baseline, and patient was discharged on a slow taper 
of 40mg daily through ___ (1 day, 5 days total) then 30mg 
once daily through ___ (5 days), then 20mg daily through 
___ (5 days), then 10mg daily through ___ (5 days), then 
resuming his regular home course of 10mg Prednisone every other 
day. 
.
# Diabetes:  Pt's HgbA1C was in the low 7's recently, but sugars 
were difficult to control on Prednisone with highs in 400's and 
hyperglycemia overnight despite being on home Metformin and 
Glyburide, and humalog SSI.  Prednisone was decreased to 40mg to 
lessen effect on blood glucose, and ___ was consulted.  Pt's 
___ Glyburide was changed to Glimepiride with improvement of 
sugars.  However, he continued to become hyperglycemic with 
meals and was thus discharged to short term rehab with humalog 
SSI to cover him until his Prednisone taper was complete. 
.
# Wound care: Patient had poorly healing wounds on his left shin 
and right buttock. Wound care was consulted.
.
# Chronic venous insufficiency: Most likely contributing to 
poorly healing wound on left shin. He was given ___ compression 
stockings to take home. He was minimally edematous on admission 
in the lower extremities below the knee. ___ stockings were kept 
off left leg during admission due to poorly healing wound, and 
pt was instructed to wear TEDs at home when his leg recovers.
.
# Vitamin B12: Was given monthly B12 injection on second day of 
admission.

diastolic CHF and emphysema on ___ home O2 was admitted from 
the ED with dyspnea, now markedly improved. 

1. Emphysema
Patient presented with his typical COPD flare, and was treated 
with IV solumedrol initially, which was subsequently  
transitioned to oral prednisone.  He was treated with 
doxycycline, albuterol and atrovent nebs. With these measures, 
pt began to return to his previous respiratory baseline, which 
is known to be tenuous.  He was discharged on a short steroid 
taper.

2. Thrombocytopenia

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ was admitted due to acute renal failure which was 
discovered after being sent to the Emergency Department for 
concerns of hemoptysis.  He had a CT chest which was negative 
and given the small volumes produced this is likely related to 
his PE and anticoagulation.  He was given a small fluid bolus 
(500mL) and his renal function improved.  His lasix dose was 
decreased from 80mg daily to 60mg daily.
This is a ___ yo male with severe COPD, DMII, obesity, recently 
diagnosed PE presenting with hemoptysis and incidentally found 
to have acute renal failure and hyperkalemia.

# Hemoptysis: Pt was sent to ED for hemoptysis.  Given the small 
quantity of blood tinged sputum and the known PE in the setting 
of anticoagulation along with the negative CT chest concern for 
new pathology low.  If develops more bleeding should follow up 
with PCP or return to ED.
.  
# ARF: Cr 1.6 up from baseline, but after holding lasix and 
given small fluid bolus 500mL Cr returned to baseline.
.
# Hyperkalemia: Resolved with insulin/glucose/kayexolate and 
fluids given in ED.  
.  
# Severe COPD, FEV 20% predicted: He is oxygenating well on 
baseline 4L via NC. No evidence of COPD exacerbation at this 
time.  Continued on outpatient reg..

___ CTA chest:
TECHNIQUE: MDCT-acquired axial images were obtained through the 
chest before and after the administration of intravenous 
contrast material. Multiplanar reformatted images were also 
obtained.

FINDINGS: The pulmonary arterial tree is well opacified and 
there is no pulmonary embolism. There are no acute aortic 
abnormalities. There is no pericardial effusion. Airspace 
consolidation is noted in the left lower lobe, indicating 
possible aspiration in the setting of recent cardiac arrest. 
Dependent atelectasis is also seen bilaterally. Emphysematous 
changes are seen bilaterally, most prominently at the apices. 
The tracheobronchial tree is patent to subsegmental levels. 
Multiple subcentimeter mediastinal lymph nodes are seen. There 
is no hilar lymphadenopathy. While this examination is not 
optimized for evaluation of the abdomen, limited images of the 
upper abdomen are unremarkable.

Examination of osseous structures reveals minimal degenerative 
disease of the thoracic spine. No suspicious lytic or blastic 
lesions are identified.

IMPRESSION:
1. No pulmonary embolism or acute aortic abnormalities.
2. Small airspace consolidation of the left lung base likely 
represents aspiration in the setting of recent cardiac arrest. 
Bibasilar atelectasis.
3. Emphysema.

___ CXR: 
AP UPRIGHT VIEW OF THE CHEST AT APPROXIMATELY 10:45 A.M.: 
Prominent interstitial markings are unchanged in appearance from 
prior radiograph, consistent with chronic lung disease. There is 
no focal consolidation or pleural effusion. Mild enlargement of 
the cardiac silhouette is stable. Pulmonary vasculature is 
slightly engorged, without signs of overt edema. Soft tissue and 
osseous structures are unremarkable.

IMPRESSION: Stable appearance of chronic lung disease with 
prominent interstitial markings. Slight interval increase in 
engorgement of pulmonary vasculature.

___ ECG:
Sinus tachycardia. The P-R interval is 160 milliseconds. There 
is a late 
transition which is probably normal. Non-specific ST-T wave 
changes. Compared 
to the previous tracing ST-T wave changes are now present.

Cardiac size is top normal. Faint ill-defined peripheral 
opacities in the lower lobes bilaterally are increasing and 
worse on the right side. There is no pneumothorax. Atelectasis 
is in the left lower lobe. There are no sizable pleural 
effusions.

IMPRESSION: Worsening faint ill-defined basilar opacities 
consistent with aspiration

 
Brief Hospital Course:
A&P: ___ yo male smoker with DMII, severe COPD (FEV1/FVC 43% 
predicted) on home O2 presents after being unresponsive at a 
routine visit to his NP.  
.  
# s/p unresponsiveness/pulseless arrest: Thought to be due to O2 
tank malfunction/hypoxia. He was admitted to ICU and observed 
overnight.  Telemetry unremarkable during this admission as well 
as cardiac enzymes were negative.  CTA chest did not show any PE 
but did show consolidation from aspiration.  Echo was done and 
compared with the prior study on ___, regional left 
ventricular systolic dysfunction and mitral regurgitation were 
not identified.  He was transferred to the floor in a stable 
condition and repeat CXR on ___ showed worsening aspiration, so 
levofloxacin and flagyl were started.  Pt was continued on all 
his home meds with prednisone, 3L supplement O2 via nasal 
cannula, singulair, and nebs for COPD.    
.  
# Aspiration pneumonia: On CTA chest, there seemed to be a 
consolidiation. Pt remained afebrile with normal WBC.  However, 
pt reported having cough productive of thick clear mucous 
different from his COPD coughs, and repeat CXR on ___ showed 
worsening aspiration PNA, thus levofloxacin and flagyl were 
started on ___ to complete a 10 day course for aspiration PNA.  

.  
# DMII: Hgb A1C 6.5. Pt was initially on insulin sliding scale.  
Once his po was back to his baseline, his home oral agents were 
restarted.

Brief Hospital Course:
___ old male with severe COPD on home O2, DM, HTN, obesity, 
tobacco abuse admitted with worsening DOE consistent with COPD 
exacerbation.  Also found to have ARF. For his COPD 
exacerbation, started on prednisone taper (over 2weeks), 
levaquin, nebs. For his ARF, bactrim held, lasix/lisinopril 
held, recieved IVFs, improved on discharge. Has osmotic diuresis 
from hyperglycemia (while on steroids) so lasix held until he is 
off the higher dose of prednisone. Lisinopril also restarted at 
lower dose since K 4.5 and can increase back to 40mg once he is 
back on lasix to counteract the hyperK. For his hyperglycemia, 
glyburide increased to 5mg qd until he is back on prednisone 
10mg (previous dose) at which time he will take 2.5mg on days he 
takes prednisone. His recent LLE cellulits appears to have

Brief Hospital Course:
___ yo M with COPD on 4 L home O2, CHF, PE on coumadin who 
presents with worsening shortness of breath.
   
# Shortness of breath: Likely multifactorial from recurrent COPD 
exacerbation, volume overload from worsening CHF, possibly 
worsening pulmonary hypertension. Patient with severe COPD, but 
current oxygen saturations are not far from his baseline of mid 
___ on 4 L NC. ABG consistent with a possible acute on chronic 
respiratory acidosis with some metabolic compensation. Patient 
with increased weight gain and worsening ___ while at rehab. CXR 
with ?LLL infiltrate, but patient has had multiple PNAs in the 
past, without fever or increased sputum production, so CXR 
finding could be resolving previous PNA. Suspicion for ACS/MI 
low given no evidence of EKG changes and no chest pain. Patient 
may also have worsening pulmonary hypertension from his severe 
COPD contributing to his DOE. Pulmonary embolism was thought to 
be unlikely given chronic therapeutic anticoagulation with 
coumadin. The patient did complain of increased ___ pain and 
swellling, likely from pre-existing venous insufficiency and 
___ was negative.  

Overnight, the patient was maintained on face tent oxygen, and 
clinically improved.  Saturations trended in the low 90's with 
transient dips into the high ___ and ___, primarily with 
exhertion, talking and eating.  In the morning the patient 
received a second dose of azithromycin and prednisone was weaned 
down to 60 mg po.  He felt back to baseline from a respiratory 
status at the time of transfer.   
.
# COPD: Severe (FEV1/FVC 43%) on 4 L home O2. Home oxygen sats 
are in mid 80% range. Followed by Dr. ___. Continued inhalers 
and spirava as above and prednisone with plan to rapidly tape to 
baseline of 20 mg daily.
.
# CHF: EF > 55% in ___. Patient reports worsening SOB, ___, and 
with weight gain (dry weight appears to be ~210, currently 220 
lbs on admission).  The patient was diuresed overnight with net 
negative about 1L.  TTE was obtained which showed EF >55% and 
moderate pulm arterial hypertension.  Of note the echo did show 
a prominent anterior fat pad versus a loculated pericardial 
effusion anteriorly.  This does not correlate clinically and on 
lateral CXR there was a very prominent retrosternal space that 
this finding may represent.  This may be followed up as an 
outpatient.  
.   
# ___ erythema: Pt with cellulitis in this leg in ___ and with 
chronic venous stasis changes. Reports slightly increased 
erythema without spread and some pain in this leg. DDx includes 
worsening cellulitis vs. DVT (although latter unlikely given INR 
is therapeutic). As mentioned, ___ was negative.  Erythema 
did not progress overnight, the patient remained afebrile, and 
the leg was not particularly warm.  We chose to not continue 
treating for cellulitis.  Likely changes of chronic venous 
stasis.
.
# PE: Diagnosed in ___, on coumadin. continued coumadin 5 mg 
PO daily
.  
# HTN: Continued home anti-hypertensives (amlodipine, lasix)
. 
# HLD: Continued statin
.   
# DM: Held glyburide.  Started on RISS. Transiently required 
insulin gtt overnight, FSGs improved to 100s.  Spiked to 499 
after eating late breakfast, covered with 12U humalog.  Likely 
poor control due to high dose steroid requirement.
.   
# Psoriasis: topical steroids.
