History of Present Illness:
Mr. ___ is a ___ yo M with a past medical history 
significant for bronchiectasis, COPD, and hiatal hernia 
presenting with dyspnea at rest x 1 day preceded by sore throat 
x 5 days, cough x 3 days, and runny nose x 3 days. He was ___ his 
usual state of health until developing a sore throat on ___. On 
___ night, he developed bad nasal congestion and a cough 
productive of clear sputum. On ___ he began feeling

increasingly dyspneic, and by late afternoon was gasping for air 
and coughing up greenish sputum. He called his pulmonologist, 
who told him to present to the ED for further evaluation.

___ the ED, initial vitals were T 98, HR 62, BP 172/87, RR 26, O2 
sat. 96% RA.

Initial physical exam was notable for lungs with diffuse 
rhonchorous sounds and wheezing.

Labs were notable for WBC 11.7, Hgb 12.0, Na 131, Cr 1.1, UA 
with 100 protein, 2RBC, 2WBC, and few bacteria, lactate 1.4

CXR showed: Large hiatal hernia. Patchy bibasilar opacities 
similar to previous studies, which "may reflect a combination of 
bronchiectasis, chronic airway disease, and recurrent 
aspiration." Trace bilateral pleural effusions.

He was given albuterol nebs, vancomycin, and cefepime, upon 
which he felt much better. However, O2 sat. dropped to 92% 
(recent baseline 95-100% RA).

On the floor this morning, Mr. ___ was no longer feeling 
short of breath at rest. He continues to deny fever, chills, or 
night sweats.

IMAGING
=======
___ CXR
Large hiatal hernia.  Patchy bibasilar opacities, similar to the 
previous 
studies, which may reflect a combination of bronchiectasis, 
chronic airways disease, and recurrent aspiration.  Trace 
bilateral pleural effusions.

___ CT CHEST WITH CONTRAST
1. Moderate to severe bronchial wall thickening and 
bronchiectasis with airway plugging throughout both lungs, 
greater ___ the lower lobes, overall progressed with findings 
suggestive of recurrent airway infection/ inflammation, 
potentially related to aspiration. 
2. Very large hiatal hernia, progressed from prior, with the 
majority of the stomach being located within the chest.  This 
likely predisposes the patient to aspiration. 
3. Other baseline findings, including complex left upper pole 
renal cyst 
measuring up to 8.1 cm, as described above. 
 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ is a ___ year old man with a past medical history 
significant for bronchiectasis, COPD, and hiatal hernia 
presenting with dyspnea at rest x 1 day preceded by sore throat, 
cough, and rhinorrhea. He had a CXR that demonstrated patchy 
bibasilar opacities. Initially with concern for possible 
pneumonia, he was given vanc/cefepime while ___ the ED. 

#Dyspnea: Clinically, he appeared well, so antibiotics were held 
and he was monitored on the floor. Troponin was 0.02 on 
admission and trended down to 0.01. EKG showed no ischemic 
changes. He had an elevated BNP but with no pulmonary edema on 
CT chest and no clinical signs of volume overload. He was given 
chest ___ and standing ipratropium/albuterol nebulizers. CT chest 
was performed that showed bronchiectasis ___ both lungs that 
appeared progressed from prior images and worsening hiatal 
hernia. Flu swab was negative. Sputum culture found gram 
positive cocci and ___ consultation with infectious diseases the 
patient was given a 5 day course of azithromycin for presumed 
bacterial infection. Ambulatory saturation on discharge showed 
92%. Blood cultures remained negative for any growth. He will 
need close follow up with his pulmonologist. 

#Hiatal hernia: Progression seen on CT. Continued pantoprazole

#CAD s/p CABG and stent placement and hyperlipidemia: Continue 
home aspirin, statin, and metoprolol. 

#Hypertension: Continued on home losartan.
