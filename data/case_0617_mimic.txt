History of Present Illness:
Patient is a ___ female with past medical history 
significant for cerebellar hemorrhage (___) due to AVM s/p s/p 
suboccipital craniotomy (___) with recurrent hemorrhage 
(___) s/p repeat craniotomy and
excision of AVM with duraplasty and pericranial graft and 
titanium mesh placement (___) complicated by craniotomy site 
infection (___), residual dysarthria/dysphagia, RA on 
methotrexate, who is referred from ___ with concern for 
ongoing aspiration, UTI.

Briefly, patient was admitted to ___ in ___ for a cerebellar 
hemorrhage with intraventricular extension ___ a cerebellar AVM. 
She underwent suboccipital craniotomy and evacuation of 
hematoma. THis was then complicated by a recurrent hemorrhage 
after falling at home. She underwent a planned AVM excision in 
___. FOllowing these admission, she spent extended time at a 
rehab facility, with PEG tube. Since her ICH, she has had 
residual deficits including ataxia, diplopia as well as 
dysphagia. 

Regaeding her severe dysphagia, she was previously being fed via 
G-tube. She has had multiple aspiration pneumonias in the past 
year. She is now on a modified diet with thickened liquids and 
soft solids. She has had cough after meals. She has been 
evaluated by speech and language therapist and initially noted 
significant improvement after e-stim stimulation. SHe has also 
had drooling with difficulty clearing her secretions. TO this 
end, her neurologist switched her from gabapentin to low-dose 
nortriptyline 10 mg at bedtime with dual purpose of treating her 
pain and helping with her drooling. SHe also saw ENT in ___ 
and was diagnosed with sialorrhea/ptyalism, oropharyngeal 
dysphagia with aspiration based on flexible videostroboscopy and 
review of prior modified barium swallow. ENT felt that her 
aspiration pnas were due to the
saliva rather than her diet and recommended Botox injection to 
the saliva glands, which she underwent on ___

Since this time she states she has worsening dysphagia, as well 
as coughing and difficulty managing the secretions. The patient 
has also been reporting dysuria and urinary latency, however she 
is unclear how long this has been going on. She had previous 
been treated with a course of Bactrim for this. Patient denies 
any fevers, chills, chest pain, shortness of breath, abdominal 
pain. Reports intermittent diarrhea. She presented to ___, 
where labs were remarkable for ___ positive, positive nitrite, 
and chest x-ray showed right middle lobe opacity which had 
actually decreased from prior studies. The patient was treated 
with levofloxacin 750mg IV. Patient was transferred for 
evaluation by ENT for concern for aspiration.  

 In the ED, initial VS were: 96.8 106 122/70 20 100% RA 
  
ENT consulted, felt that it was difficult to tell whether 
symptoms are new since botox injection or she is at her 
baseline. Recommended continued work-up of dysphagia, NPO, SLP 
evaluation

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ is a ___ female with history of cerebellar 
hemorrhage (___) due to AVM s/p s/p multiple craniotomies 
(___) and recurrent hemorrhage complicated by 
residual dysarthria/dysphagia (required PEG tube for a period of 
time in ___, later removed), RA on methotrexate. She has had 
progressive issues with recurrent aspiration pneumonias and 
suspected aspiration of her secretions for which she underwent a 
botox injection to her saliva glands by ENT on ___ after which 
she noted an acute decline in her speech and ability to swallow. 
Referred from ___ with concern for ongoing aspiration now 
s/p PEG tube placement.

#HX of AVM s/p s/p suboccipital craniotomy (___) with 
recurrent hemorrhage (___)
#Baseline dysphagia/dysarthria
#Moderate Protein Calorie Malnutrition
She has had a modified barium swallow most recently in ___ 
at ___ with trace aspiration. Ongoing aspiration was felt 
due to copious secretions and sialorrhea by ENT so she underwent 
botox injection of salivary glands ___. Notably, back in ___, 
she had spent an extended time at a rehab facility with PEG tube 
feeds which were later discontinued. The patient has expressed 
resistance to the idea of having a PEG tube placed again. Due to 
2 reported falls within the past 2 weeks prior to admission 
combined with patient reports of worsening ability to ambulate 
during that time, head Ct was ordered to rule out bleed, which 
was unchanged since prior in ___. It is possible she may have 
had a small ischemic stroke, not detected by head CT however 
there would frankly be little to be done within her goals of 
___ and her weakness and swallowing issues began worsening over 
a week ago.
Discussed with SLP and pt noted to be frankly aspirating. Made 
her strict NPO (was previously on thickened liquids and soft 
solids at baseline). 

After failing a bedside S/S, a feeding tube was placed ___ 
after family meeting resulted in agreement to use artificial 
feeding temporarily pending VFSS. VFSS revealed profound 
dysphagia and severe aspiration and asphyxiation risk. If this 
were strictly effect from botox, we could see improvement as 
early as 2 weeks from now, or it could take up to a few months. 
PEG tube was placed ___ to allow time for improvement. Plan to 
discharge to rehab for intensive SLP therapy at rehab in hopes 
her swallow function will improve overtime. On ___ had some 
nausea after bolus tube feed, so was placed on continuous 
overnight. However bolus feeding was successful on ___ without 
significant nausea.

- continue Jevity 1.5, 1 240 cc can 4x daily (if using Jevity 
1.2, can use 5 cans daily)
- 60 cc water flush before and after each bolus
- speech/swallow therapy - hope is that function will return

#Mechanical falls
Due to 2 reported falls within the past 2 weeks prior to
admission combined with patient reports of worsening ability to
ambulate during that time. ___ unchanged since ___. 

#RA: held methotrexate in setting of poor po intake. Will 
restart at discharge

#Overactive bladder
Family reports h/o overactive bladder resulting in many 
nocturnal
awakenings and inquired about starting meds. Should definitely 
be
explored but will hold introducing a new medication at this time
and defer this decision to her PCP.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ was transferred to the ED at ___ from ___ 
___ with a cerebellar hemorrhage with intraventricular 
extension. Upon arrival, she underwent a CTA which showed a 
vascular malformation. She was taken to the operating room 
emergently and underwent a suboccipital craniotomy and 
evacuation of hematoma. She was admitted to the ICU 
post-operatively for close monitoring.

On ___, she underwent a head CT which showed hydrocephalus. She 
underwent placement of a right frontal VP shunt. She underwent a 
head CT post-placement of EVD which showed good placement of the 
catheter tip. Her SBP was liberalized to <160 and her neurologic 
checks were liberalized to every 4-hours.  

On ___, her neurologic examination was improving as she was 
following simple commands. An embolization of AVM was planned 
for today. ICPs were within normal limits throughout the day. 

On ___, the patient's neurologic examination remained stable. 
The EVD was raised to 15. Tube feeds were started. 

On ___, the patient was extubated in the early morning but 
developed increased work of breathing and was unable to protect 
her airway and was subsequently re intubated. The EVD was raised 
to 20.  The ICPs were reading negative in the evening and there 
was no drainage from the EVD and it was replaced and set at 10.  


On ___ the patient underwent a bronchoscopy; antibiotics for 
her UTI were changed, her cultures showed pseudomonas. Her EVD 
was clamped later in the day and when trach and PEG were 
discussed the patient was agreeable through nodding head.  

On ___ she was stable and her EVD remained clamped. Her CXR 
showed bibasilar atelectasis, and her EVD was noted to be 
leaking. She underwent CT scan which showed stable ventricular 
size and the EVD was discontinued. Her neuro checks were also 
changed to q1hour.

On ___ she continued to be stable and she underwent trach and 
PEG placement which was done without incident.

On ___ she was neurologically stable following trach and PEG 
placement and was ventilated via trach mask. A CT of the head 
was planned for ___.

On ___ Patient remained neurologically stable. She was 
evaluated by speech and swallow for a Passy Muir valve. 

On ___ CT of the head revealed stable ventricle size. She 
remained neurologically stable. She was transferred to the floor 
with telemetry. ___ and OT were consulted. 

On ___, Free water flushes were decreased to 50 Q6h, salt tabs 
were started for a serum sodium of 131. Speech and swallow 
evaluated the patient for a PMV, but it was not tolerated due to 
copious secretions and high tracheal pressures.  Her cuff was 
reinflated.

On ___, Mrs. ___ was transferred to ___ ___.  The 
patient was afebrile, hemodynamically and neurologically stable. 
 Her WBC was up from 13 to 14, but remains on Cipro for a 
urinary and respiratory tract infection (pseudomonas and 
serratia, respectively, both sensitive to cipro).  Per discharge 
instructions, the patient should follow up with Dr. ___ in 
one month where a non-contrast head CT should be obtained prior 
to that appointment.  A signout was provided by myself to the NP 
at ___.  

Outstanding/current issues are as follows:

#Hyponatremia.  Sodium levels remain at 130-131 despite starting 
NaCl tablets and reducing free water.  This should be continued 
by the rehabilitation facility.

#Infectious Disease.  Patient is currently on day 5 of Cipro 
therapy for serratia in sputum and pseudomonas in urine.  
Current WBC is 14 but is currently afebrile.  

#Trach weaning.  Patient has been trialed on cuff deflation for 
24 hours, but did not tolerate well due to an increase in 
secretions.  Also a Passey-Muir valve was trialed ___ by the 
Speech/Swallow Therapist.  The valve was not tolerated due the 
increase in secretions and high tracheal pressures.  Ongoing, 
intermittent cuff deflation should be continued based on the 
rehab's evaluation.

#Cerebellar AVM:  Mrs. ___ will need to undergo a cerebral 
angiogram in the future for securing of her known cerebellar 
arteriovenous malformation.  The patient should follow up with 
Dr. ___ in one month with a non-contrast head CT prior to 
that appointment.
