IMAGING:
==================
CXR (___):  
The lung volumes are normal. The patient is in a moderate to 
severe pulmonary edema. Mild cardiomegaly. No pleural effusions. 
No pneumonia. 
 
TTE (___):  
IMPRESSION: Moderate left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved 
regional and global systolic function and reduced longitudinal 
strain of the basal segments, which may be consistent with 
amyloidosis. Thickened mitral valve with trivial mitral 
regurgitation. Normal biventricular systolic function. Moderate 
pulmonary hypertension. Small secundum ASD vs. stretched PFO. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ is a ___ gentleman with a h/o ESRD on HD and 
HTN, who presented with palpitations and chest pain during HD, 
found to have new Afib and NSTEMI.  
 
# NSTEMI:  Patient presented with chest pain, a troponin leak, 
and dynamic EKG changes.  His chest pain resolved in the ED.  It 
was unclear if patient had a type 1 NSTEMI leading to new Afib 
or demand ischemia secondary to atrial fibrillation.  Patient 
was started on a heparin gtt.  He was continued on ASA, 
atorvastatin, and lisinopril.  A left heart catheterization was 
deferred.

# Atrial fibrillation:  Patient has no history of arrhythmia.  
He spontaneously cardioverted to NSR at OSH and remained in 
sinus rhythm throughout the hospitalization.  TSH was normal at 
OSH.  Patient was switched from labetalol to carvedilol for 
better blood pressure control.  Given CHADS2 score of 1, 
warfarin was deferred.  Patient was discharged on ASA 325.

# RVH/LVH:  TTE was very concerning for amyloidosis.  There was 
evidence of severe pulmonary edema on CXR, but patient was 
breathing comfortably and not hypoxic.  He appeared euvolemic on 
exam.  Patient will be scheduled to see a cardiologist for 
further evaluation of possible amyloidosis (i.e. a cardiac MRI, 
serum markers).     

# ESRD:  Patient was continued on T, Th, Sa HD schedule.

# Hypertension:  Patient was mildly hypertensive.  He was 
switched from labetalol to carvedilol 12.5 mg bid for better 
blood pressure control.  He was continued on lisinopril 
(reportedly on 40 mg bid), but on 20 mg daily.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
======================
[ ] Patient is scheduled to follow-up with cardiology for 
further evaluation of possible cardiac amyloidosis, including 
cardiac MRI. 
[ ] Uptitrate lisinopril and carvedilol as needed for 
hypertension.
[ ] Patient was started on ASA 325 mg for stroke reduction given 
CHADS2 of 1.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,

It was a pleasure caring for you during your stay at ___.  You 
were admitted for chest pain and an abnormal fast heart rhythm 
called atrial fibrillation.  An EKG and labs showed that you had 
a mild heart attack, likely brought on by the fast heart rate.  
You were given medications to treat this, and your chest pain 
resolved.  Your heart returned to a normal rhythm.  

An ultrasound of your heart suggested that you may have a 
condition called cardiac amyloidosis, which is a condition that 
causes progressive heart failure.  We are working to schedule an 
appointment with a cardiologist at ___, and it is very 
important to keep this appointment because there are additional 
tests that need to be done, and potentially advanced treatment 
to help slow the progression of heart failure.  This is 
extremely important!!  If you are having difficulty scheduling 
follow-up through ___, please call ___ for 
assistance, at Location: ___ CARDIOLOGY 
Address: ___, ___ 
Phone: ___ 

You were started on a full-dose aspirin to reduce your risk of 
stroke (given your abnormal heart rhythm).  We switched your 
blood pressure medication (labetalol) to carvedilol, which is 
better for your heart.  We also started you on several 
medications (aspirin and atorvastatin) that are very important 
to help prevent future heart attacks.

We wish you good health!
-Your ___ Team

Noncontrast head CT: Incomplete head CT excludes the vertex.
Hyperdensity within the left temporal lobe corresponds to known
intraparenchymal hemorrhage with intraventricular extension into
the lateral ventricle temporal horn. Overall, the appearance is
similar to the study from 7 hours prior. Periventricular and
subcortical white matter hypodensities are nonspecific but 
likely
sequelae of chronic small vessel ischemic disease. Incidental
note is
made of bilateral optic nerve hyperdensities, likely
calcifications.

CTA head and neck: Calcifications are noted at the bilateral
C4-C5 ICA and origin of the right vertebral artery without flow
limitation. The bilateral posterior cerebral arteries are
difficult to visualize beyond the P2 segments. Otherwise, the
major vessels of the neck, circle of ___, and their principal
intracranial branches appear without flow limiting stenosis,
occlusion, or formation of aneurysms larger than 3 mm. 

CXR: Interval progression of pulmonary edema since exam from
earlier the same day. Superimposed infection is not excluded.

EKG: QTc 583, TWI in V5-V6, Possible LBBB

 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ year old male with history of ESRD on HD, diastolic CHF with 
prior question of amyloidosis, and atrial fibrillation on 
warfarin admitted ___ with intracranial hemorrhage in the 
setting of hypertensive emergency, medically managed, course 
complicated by labile blood pressures, 

# Hypertensive emergency 
# Intraventricular Bleed
Patient presented with confusion and was found to have 
spontaneous left temporal horn primary intraventricular 
hemorrhage. in setting of severe hypertension (220s systolic) 
after missed dialysis. He was started on nicardipine drip.  
Given that his INR was subtherapeutic at 1.4, he did not require 
reversal. Upon evaluation by neurosurgery, he did not require 
EVD placement as the his exam was stable and repeat imaging 
showed the bleed to be stable as well. His home warfarin was 
held and repeat CT after 7 days showed stability. Due to concern 
about the possibility for repeat bleed if he continues to miss 
hemodialysis or does not reliably take his home blood pressure 
medications, he was transitioned from warfarin to ASA 81mg. 
Following the intraventricular bleed, his blood pressure goal 
was initially set at systolic < 150mmHg and long term systolic < 
130mmHg---however, this was further modified due to concern for 
inaccurate blood pressure readings in his upper extremity: the 
decision was made to monitor his blood pressure in his left arm 
and leg and to adjust his BP goal based on the average between 
BP in the arm and the leg, with the blood pressure goal was set 
to systolic <160, with long term goal of systolic < 140. During 
the remainder of his hospitalization, his blood pressure 
remained labile, with a final, stable regimen of lisinopril 40mg 
qam, nifedipine ER 60mg qhs, and labetalol 100 TID resulting in 
control.  Patient is planned for follow up with neurology at 
___ in ___ weeks for reevaluation with CT head noncontrast and 
risk/benefit discussion re: whether to restart home warfarin.  
Of note, patient seen by OT given Intraventricular Bleed--he was 
independent with basic ADLs, but required supervision ambulating 
without assistive device, demonstrated poor insight into home 
safety, unable to complete medication management.  He was 
recommended for home with 24 hours services. 

# Acute Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure secondary to
# Acute on chronic diastolic CHF 
On admission, patient with hypoxemia respiratory failure, 
improved with 2L O2 on nasal cannula. CXR shows volume overload 
with JVD and high BNP, though no leg edema. He was given IV 
Lasix without significant urinary response. He subsequently had 
additional volume removed through dialysis. He was weaned to 
room air. 

# Paroxysmal A Fib on Warfarin: CHADsVASC 4. HASBLED 4.
Remained in sinus rhythm this admission. As above, he had been 
on warfarin for anticoagulation, but this was held in setting of 
bleed.  Due to concerns about patient's ability to reliably take 
his medications and attend HD, and his high risk for repeat 
bleed with his difficult to control BPs, his home warfarin was 
transitioned to ASA 81mg. Patient is planned for follow up with 
neurology at ___ in ___ weeks for reevaluation with CT head 
noncontrast and risk benefit discussion re: warfarin.  

# Thrombocytopenia:
On admission, patient's platelet count was 144k and slowly 
downtrended for several days, reaching a nadir of 95k. As his 
neurological exam was stable, it was assumed to be related to 
consumption of platelets in setting of intracranial bleed. His 
platelet count improved to 143k prior to discharge.

# Elevated Troponin:
Upon admission, patient with elevated troponin to 0.09 without 
chest pain.  TTE without new focal wall motion abnormalities. 

# ESRD, Non-Oliguric
Patient with ESRD on HD MWF. He received dialysis throughout his 
hospital admission on a ___ schedule.

# Mitral Stenosis
TTE incidentally showed moderate to severe mitral stenosis.  
Would consider outpatient cardiology referral; 

Transitional issues 
[] Blood pressure goals and approach as above 
[] Please continue to hold patient's warfarin until upcoming 
neurology appointment for CT head and risk/benefit discussion 
re: restarting anticoagulation
[] During prior admission was recommended for cardiac MRI for 
workup for possible amyloidosis; he denied following up on this; 
consider outpatient referral; 
[ ] Incidentally found to have "Nonspecific asymmetry of the 
base of the toe, which is enlarged on the right side. While this 
may represent asymmetrical tongue base lymphoid tissue, a tongue 
base lesion cannot be excluded." Recommended for "ENT referral, 
CT neck and direct visualization, for further assessment of the 
possible right sided tongue base lesion is suggested if 
clinically warranted.". 
[ ] incidentally found to have CT chest with "mediastinal and 
hilar lymph nodes are enlarged and some which are calcified, 
could be related to prior granulomatous disease."; also showed 
"Multiple scattered bilateral pulmonary nodules some which which 
are calcified could also represent granulomatous disease."  
Consider outpatient workup 
[ ] TTE incidentally showed moderate to severe mitral stenosis.  
Would consider outpatient cardiology referral;

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,
It was a pleasure taking care of you at the ___ 
___!  

WHY WAS I IN THE HOSPITAL?  
==========================  
- You were admitted because you had a bleed in your brain that 
was likely due to high blood pressure.  

WHAT HAPPENED IN THE HOSPITAL?  
==============================  
-  Due to the location of the bleed and your minimal symptoms, 
no surgery was performed for the bleed. Your warfarin, a blood 
thinner, was stopped and your blood pressure was treated. 
- You were started on aspirin to replace your previous blood 
thinner. 
- Your blood pressure continued to remain high despite several 
changes to your blood pressure medications. You will be sent 
home on the final medications that was able to control your 
blood pressure. 
- You had imaging of your brain that demonstrated that you were 
not having additional bleeding in your brain and that the bleed 
had started to disappear. 

WHAT SHOULD I DO WHEN I GO HOME?  
================================  
- Be sure to take all your medications and attend all of your 
appointments listed below. 

Thank you for allowing us to be involved in your care, we wish
