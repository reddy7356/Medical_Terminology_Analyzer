History of Present Illness:
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  
___ year old female with recent diagnosis of pyelonphritis and 
left renal abscess persenting with left flank pain, low grade 
temperature, flank and abdominal pain, myalgias. The patient 
reports the day prior to presentation, she developed left sided 
flank pain, myalgias, and a low grade fever of 100.5. She denies 
dysuria, increased urinary frequency, urinary urgency. She also 
notes epigastric pain and heartburn the day prior to 
presentation, which subsequently resolved.  
.  
The patient's current presentation is similar to when she was 
first diagnosed with renal abscess on ___ (CT A/P demonstrated 
a 2.1 x 2.2 cm left renal abscess at the superior pole). The 
patient was initially found to have a positive UA ___ and 
was treated with Bactrim, then switched to Cipro by her PCP 
___ and completed a 7 day course. She initially felt better, 
but then developed abdominal and flank pain with fevers and 
chills, and had a renal US and was found to have a right renal 
abscess. The source was unclear (UTI vs hematogenous). 
Unfortunately there were no cultures to narrow coverage. She was 
treated Cefepime with plan to treat for ___ weeks via PICC line. 
Repeat US on ___ showed decrease in size of abscess suggesting 
adequate treatment. Of note she missed her most recent 
appointment on ___, but plan at that time was to continue 
Cefepime through ___. She is currently followed by ID as an 
outpatient and reports she has been compliant with her Cefepime.

Renal U/S ___:  
Renal ultrasound comparison is made to a prior ultrasound dated 
___. The right kidney measures 10.5 cm. The left kidney 
measures 11.9 cm. In the left kidney in the upper pole, there is 
a hypoechoic lesion with irregular borders, this measures 1.5 x

hydronephrosis. No stones are seen.  
Renal ___: Normal renal ultrasound with no discrete fluid 
collection visualized in the region of the left upper pole at 
site of known previous abcess. 
 
Brief Hospital Course:
Pt was admitted to the hospital for left flank pain, low grade 
temp in setting of known left renal abscess.  Pt had been 
followed by ID, she had been on Cefepime and had a PICC in left 
arm.  Pt's renal ultrasound showed that the renal abscess had 
resolved.  Concern on admission that the PICC may be infected vs 
DVT as patient reported recent pain at the site and was 
reportedly erythematous on admission.  U/s of L upper arm was 
negative for DVT.  Blood cx and cx of PICC tip sent, PICC line 
pulled.  u/a neg for infection. 

Lab work revealed pt to be leukopenic (2.9) w/ 5% atypicals.  
Infectious workup included CXR - neg, u/a - neg, HIV - neg, 
monospot - neg.  Pending labs for f/u include CMV, EBV, lyme and 
ehrlichea.  

Patient remained afebrile and stable throughout her hospital 
course.  Flank pain resolved after arriving on floor from ED and 
she remained asymptomatic while here.  Once antibiotics were 
discontinued, pt deemed safe to go home with close outpt f/u for 
pending labs and repeat CBC.  She has an appointment with ID for 
___ and a PCP appt for next week.

longer needed your antibiotics; therefore your PICC line was 
pulled.  The blood cultures and culture from your PICC are still 
pending; please have your PCP follow up on these results.  

Your lab work showed decreased white blood cells.  We started an 
infectious workup to determine the cause of this decrease.  It

back so far have been negative.  Please make sure that you 
follow up with your PCP on ___ for the rest of your 
results.

Brief Hospital Course:
___ y/o F who presented to her PCP with ___ fevers and 
intermittent flank pain over the last several days associated 
with dysuria. She had a urinary tract infection approximately 2 
weeks prior treated with a course of Bactrim which was then 
switched to Keflex. She had persistent symptoms of n/v/f and saw 
her PCP who got an ultrasound of her kidneys which demonstrated 
an abscess on her left kidney.  
.  
.  
# Renal abscess, d/t UTI vs hematogenous spread  
Pt was evaluated by Urology and Infectious Disease. Because the 
abscess was <3cm, it was decided to pursue medical management 
with IV antibiotics without a procedure to drain the abscess.  
Unfortunately, all cultures were contaminated with mixed flora, 
thus there is not reliable culture data to guide narrowing of 
antibiotic choice. Pt was treated with IV cefepime per ID 
recommendations, and she will be discharged on IV cefepime with 
plans for ID follow up with repeat renal ultrasounds to guide 
duration of therapy.  ID is expecting a course fo ___ weeks of 
IV antibiotics.  PICC line was placed ___.  
.  
# CoNS blood culture; contaminant 
A blood culture returned with CoNS, which was initially 
concerning, however, this was determined to be a contaminant.  
CoNS is very rarely a cause of renal abscess, and thus not 
thought to represent a true infection. Repeat blood cultures 
remain pending at the time of discharge.  Note that the blood 
culture was only positive in one set. Micro sensitivities 
reported in OMR.

Patient was discharged to home with home IV Abx.
