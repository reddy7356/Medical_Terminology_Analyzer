The left atrium is dilated. There is moderate symmetric left 
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is 
normal. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion 
abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Overall left ventricular 
systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular 
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic root is 
moderately dilated at the sinus level. The ascending aorta is 
moderately dilated. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The 
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral 
valve prolapse. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. The left 
ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation. The 
pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined. 
There is an anterior space which most likely represents a fat 
pad. 
.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of ___, 
the previously suspected thrombus on the pacing wire is not 
apparent on the current study. However, the suboptimal image 
quality precludes close examination of the pacing wrie. The 
other findings are similar.  
.
Radiology Report CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of ___ 4:03 
AM 
UPRIGHT PORABLE CHEST 
Streaky linear atelectasis is noted extending from the region of 
the right 
hila and at the left base in this patient with persistent low 
lung volumes. No evidence of interstitial pulmonary edema, 
pneumothorax, or consolidation to suggest pneumonia. The 
cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged with stable appearance 
to abnormal contour projecting above the aortic knob consistent 
with the patient's known pseudoaneurysm. Positioning of 
pacemaker leads is unchanged. 
.
Radiology Report CHEST (PA & LAT) Study Date of ___ 1:___re not well penetrated. The right hemidiaphragm 
is elevated, as before. The lungs appear clear except for 
streaky density in the retrocardiac area, which is suboptimally 
evaluated. The cardiac silhouette appears large but may be 
exaggerated by AP technique. A 4.5 cm round density projected 
adjacent to the aortic knob, consistent with a known aortic 
pseudoaneurysm is unchanged. Mediastinal structures are 
unchanged in appearance, and the bony thorax is grossly intact. 
A bipolar transvenous pacemaker remains in place.   
IMPRESSION: Streaky density in the retrocardiac area that may 
represent 
partial atelectasis or consolidation. Elevation of the right 
hemidiaphragm. No definite interval change. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
The patient is an ___ man with a history of Diabetes, 
Hypertension, diastolic CHF, s/p pacemaker, CKD, ___, 
and vascular dementia who presented for SOB/hypoxia and found to 
be in hypercarbic/hypoxic respiratory failure requiring BiPap.
.
# Hypercarbic/hypoxic respiratory failure:  The patient was 
hypoxic on admission with  SpO2 76% on NRB and an arterial blood 
gas of 7.34/66/53.  He was started on BiPap (FiO2 60%, PEEP 5, 
PS 10) with improvement of O2 sat to 90-100% which was weaned 
over several hours.  The patient had no history of COPD or 
asthma.  His acute hypoxia was felt to be due to diastolic heart 
failure, although CXR appeared to have mild pulmonary edema 
without significant change from ___.  The patient was afebrile, 
without cough, fever or leukocytosis.  PE was considered given a 
previously noted thrombus in the RA and the patient's poor 
functional capacity at baseline. However, repeat ECHO was 
without evidence of thrombus and there was no evidence of DVT on 
physical exam.  The patient received Lasix boluses for diuresis 
and was slowly switched back to his home dose of PO Lasix.  Over 
the course of hospitalization the patient had marked improvement 
in his supplemental oxygen requirements and at the time of 
discharge he was sating well on 4L of oxygen.  
.
# Diastolic CHF:  The patient had an Echocardiogram in ___ with 
evidence of mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension and 
diastolic dysfunction.  On presentation this admission, the 
patient lacked overt volume overload on arrival and chest xray 
was not remarkably changed from previous exams.  However, BNP 
was elevated at 1203. Blood pressure was noted to be 150/80 and 
the patient was given IV Lasix boluses and started on a Nitro 
gtt for blood pressure control.  Repeat ECHO showed little 
change since previous exam.  We would encourage daily weights 
and a low sodium diet in this patient.  Should his weight 
increase greater than 3 pounds, he should be given an extra ___ 
dose of Lasix. 
.
# HTN:  The patient was noted to be hypertensive during 
admission, with systolic blood pressures to the 160's/170's.  He 
was initially started on a Nitro drip for immediate blood 
pressure control.  He was then transitioned to oral medications. 
 His home dose of metoprolol was increased from 12.5mg daily to 
100mg and he was started on Imdur 30mg daily with a good 
response in BP.  At the time of discharge, his blood pressure 
was in an acceptable range of 110's systolic.
.
# CAD/Ischemia: The patient had an episode of chest pain.  
Cardiac enzymes were unremarkable with troponin was slightly 
elevated in setting of chronic renal failure, possible demand 
ischemia from diastolic CHF. The patient had no known history of 
CAD and no evidence of acute ischemic changes on EKG.
.
# DM: The patient was maintained in glipizide and an insulin 
sliding scale for extra coverage.
.
# CRI (baseline Cr 1.3-1.7):  The patient had a history of 
chronic renal insufficiency and on arrival, his creatinine was 
at baseline.  Following Lasix diuresis, the patient's creatinine 
increased to a peak of 1.9 but was trending down at the time of 
discharge.  The patient was discharged on his home dose of Lasix 
(60mg).  His renal function should be carefully monitored and 
his Lasix dosing adjusted accordingly.
.
# ___ disease/Vascular Dementia/Depression:  The patient 
was maintained on his normal regiment of donepezil, Mirapex, 
bupropion HCl, and Celexa 20 mg.  His nightly trazodone dose was 
increased to 25mg QHS.
.
# Code status: Full code, confirmed with daughter.
.

involving the majority of right lower lobe adjacent to an 
elevated right hemidiaphragm. High-attenuation foci peripherally

<B>OTHER STUDIES<b> 
Video Swallow Study ___:
SUMMARY:
Pt presents with mild-moderate oropharyngeal dysphagia as
described above.  There was premature spillage of liquids and
swallow initiation delay which resulted in silent aspiration of
thin liquids before and during the swallow and laryngeal
penetration of nectar thick liquids during the swallow.  Pt was
not sensate to aspiration and did not produce spontaneous cough. 

Treatment techniques were not effective in reducing penetration
or aspiration.  Pt also presented with prolonged mastication of
solids.  This represents a decline in swallow function since 
pt's
most recent videoswallow study, performed on ___ while pt 
was
at ___.  

Based on these deficits, I recommend a PO diet of ground solids
and nectar thick liquids at this time.  Pt should have PO meds
whole in puree.  Pt is still at risk for intermittent aspiration
with nectar thick liquids due to laryngeal penetration, though 
it
was not observed on our study.  However, I believe it is worth
trialing this diet in hopes that these restrictions will have a
positive effect on pt's respiratory symptoms.  If there is
continued concern for aspiration on this diet, repeat
videoswallow study is recommended with consideration of further
restricting pt's liquid intake.  

This swallowing pattern correlates to a Dysphagia Outcome
Severity Scale (DOSS) rating of 4, mild-moderate dysphagia.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. PO diet: ground solids, nectar thick liquids
2. PO meds whole in puree
3. Supervision and assistance with meals as needed to maintain
standard aspiration precautions.
4. If there is continued concern for aspiration on this diet,
repeat videoswallow study is recommended with consideration of
further restricting pt's liquid intake.  
.
Sleep Study from ___:
IMPRESSION:  
This was an abnormal portable polysomnogram.  There was
presumptive evidence of significant nocturnal hypoventilation 
and
hypoxemia in the form of persistently low oxygen saturations. 
Moreover, there were evidence for severe chemoreflex-mediated
sleep-disordered breathing. 
.
Suggest empiric trial of nocturnal BiPAP ___ with backup rate 
of
8 breaths per minute and 2L/min of oxygen.  If he tolerates 
this,
he can go home with this.

 
Brief Hospital Course:
The patient is an ___ year old man with a history of Diabetes, 
Hypertension, diastolic CHF, status post pacemaker, CKD, 
___, and vascular dementia who presented for 
unresponsiveness and was found to be in hypercarbic respiratory 
failure.  
.  
# Acute mental status changes: On arrival the patient was 
minimally responsive to sternal rub and did not withdraw 
extremities to pain. Given the ABG obtained at the outside 
facility the likely cause of his unresponsiveness was 
hypercarbic respiratory failure. Urine tox for opiates was 
negative and a head CT showed no acute process.  There were no 
signs of infection as the patient was afebrile, had no 
localizing symptoms, and had no leukocytosis. BiPAP was started 
and patient's mental status resolved with improving ABG's over 
the next two to three days so that on day of discharge he was at 
his baseline mental status.  
.  
# Respiratory failure: Pt was in hypercarbic respiratory failure 
at ___. There was strong suspicion he is a CO2 retainer at 
baseline as also had elevated CO2's during last hospitalization. 
 The cause of this was difficult to elucidate.  Initially, we 
screened for pharmacologic causes of altered mental status, but 
the urine tox screen was negative.  Pramipexole and Trazodone 
were both potentially sedating medications so trazodone was 
stopped and pramipexole dose was halved. Other etiologies of 
potential respiratory failure were also pursued.  Pulmonary was 
consulted and the general pulmonary team didn't think there was 
a primary pulmonary process for this problem, especially with 
negative chest CT.  Concern was also raised for aspiration, as 
patient seemed to be choking on thin liquids.  Speech and 
swallow performed a fluoroscopic swallow evaluation and did did 
document dysphagia, but patient was already on aspiration 
precautions as an outpatient so an acute aspiration episode was 
considered a less likely cause of respiratory failure.  Another 
etiology pursued was sleep apnea as the patient had a history of 
snoring.  Sleep consult was obtained and inpatient sleep study 
showed central sleep apnea pattern and recommended BiPAP.  
Finally, to screen for possible causes of central sleep apnea, 
neurology was consulted and said Parkinsonism or vascular 
dementia are possible but unlikely causes of central apnea.  
Patient was thus treated empirically with BiPAP and discharged 
with prescription for this therapy.
.  
# Pump: Patient has history of diastolic dysfunction and 
inadequate control of his diastolic heart failure was considered 
one possible contributing factor to his respiratory failure.  
Thus, over the course of the hospitalization we worked to 
optimize heart failure therapy titrating the patient's diuretic 
and beta blocker as well as adding an ACE inhibitor for better 
control of blood.  Patient was initially diuresed about one and 
a half liters then kept at relatively neutral fluid balance 
therafter.    
.  
# CAD/Ischemia: EKG showed possible new T wave inversions at 
admission but cardiac enzymes flat and never significant.  ACS 
considered extremely unlikely as cause for acute respiratory 
decompensation and no further work-up was pursued.  
.  
# Rhythm: Patient was in NSR throughout hospitalization but 
bizarre wide complex rhythm obtained from pacemaker recording.  
EP evaluated and thought unlikely to be afib and was probably an 
unusual sinus rhythm.  The patient was followed on telemetry 
throughout his hospitalization and had no clinically significant 
dysrhythmias.    
.  
# Diabetes Mellitus Type II: The patient was maintained on 
sliding scale insulin and was reasonably well controlled in the 
hospital.   
.  
# Chronic Kidney Disease (baseline Cr 1.3-1.7): Patient remained 
at stable Cr throughout addition of ACEi and other modifications 
to HTN regimen.  No acute issues.  
.  
# ___ disease/Vascular Dementia/Depression: Very unclear 
history of the exact etiologies of these processes.  Unclear if 
___ disease vs Parkinsonism as consequence of vascular 
dementia.  Patient's Pramipexole initially weaned down due to 
fear of sedation but neurology said this could worsen dysphagia 
so he was returned to his admission dose.  Psychiatric 
medications continued at home doses.  
.
The patient was NPO initially but as his mental status cleared 
he was allowed to eat.  Liquids were thickened and he had ground 
solids per Speech and Swallow reccs.  he was maintained on SC 
heparin for DVT prophylaxis.  He was DNR but 1 shock was 
allowed, which was confirmed by the patient's health care 
proxies.  He was discharged to ___ after 
stabilized on new medication regimen and probable cause of 
hypercarbic episodes was discovered.

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted to the hospital because you were confused and 
not thinking well.  We believe this was due to you having low 
oxygen in your blood and high carbon dioxide due to not 
breathing adequately.  This was most likely due to the fact that 
 you stop breathing when you sleep in addition to a bit a bit of 
a worsening of your heart failure.  
.
Your medications have been changed.  You have been started on 
LISINOPRIL, a medication to help control your blood pressure.  
Your METOPROLOL XL dose was also increased to better control 
your blood pressure.  Your FUROSEMIDE (LASIX) dose has been 
decreased in order to protect you from the combined affect of it 
and LISINOPRIL on your kidneys.  Your TRAZODONE has been stopped 
as this medication might worsen your breathing at night.  
.
You have also been started on BiPAP, a treatment to help your 
breathing at night.  This intervention should help you continue 
to breathe adequately throughout the night and prevent episodes 
of low oxygen and high carbon dioxide in the blood such as those 
that brought you into the hospital.
.
Please keep all scheduled appointments as these are important to 
maintain your health.  
.
Please weigh yourself daily and call your MD if weight > 3 lbs.
Please adher to a 2 gm sodium/day diet.  Please call your doctor 
or report to the ED if you have chest pain, shortness of breath, 
Fever to ___ F, increased swelling of your legs, or any other 
disturbing changes to your health.
