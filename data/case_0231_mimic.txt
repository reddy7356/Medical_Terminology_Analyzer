History of Present Illness:
Mr. ___ is a ___ with history of HIV (genotype IB, CD4 14) 
with CD4 14, HIV VL 130,000 (___) c/b neurosyphilis/ocular 
syphilis, disseminated VZV, and medication noncompliance, who 
eloped from ___ earlier today after being admitted to the MICU 
initially 4 days ago with fever, abdominal pain, and 
tachycardia. Please see prior MICU admission note for full 
details, but in summary: the patient initially presented to his 
PCP ___ ___ with abdominal pain and fatigue. He was admitted to 
the MICU due to altered mental status, fevers and tachycardia, 
concerning for MAC vs. neurosyphilis. He had a CT abdomen/pelvis 
without evidence of intraabdominal process; while there was 
suggestion of CBD and intrahepatic biliary dilatation, LFTs did 
not support a biliary cause of sepsis. His CXR was without overt 
evidence of pneumonia. CT head was negative for abscess or 
ring-enhancing lesion. Of note, the patient declined LP on 
numerous occasions. Other notable negative labs included 
negative flu, monospot, CMV. He had been started on 
vanc/zosyn/CTX/acyclovir and fluconazole, which had narrowed to 
CTX, and the patient was placed on azithromycin and ethambutol 
due to concerns for disseminated MAC. Acyclovir was stopped due 
to low suspicion for HSV encephalitis. 

The patient eloped AM of ___ and then re-presented to the ED 
later that same day with complaints of worsening shortness of 
breath at the urgings of his roommate who found him covered in 
fecal matter. The patient states that he returned to the ED for 
antibiotics. 
In the ED, initial vitals: T 101.1 HR 130 BP 139/86 R 30 100% RA
Labs were notable for: 
WBC 3.4 (85% PMNs, 5 bands) from 2.1, H/H 10.1/29.3, Plts 17 
(from 14), Na 125 (from 128), K 3.4 Cl 94 HCO3 19 BUN 13 Cr 0.8. 

Lactate 2.5
VBG: ___
On exam, the patient was AAOx3. He was tachypneic with RR ___ 
and tachycardic with HR 120s.

CXR showed mild new pulmonary edema and patchy right basilar 
opacity. 

Patient received: Vancomycin 1g IV, Zosyn 4.5g, Tylenol 1g IV, 
Azithromycin 500mg IV, Acyclovir 750mg IV, 1L IVF, magnesium and 
phosphorus supplementation and transferred to the floor.
 
On arrival to the MICU, the patient was upset about having to 
come back to the hospital and is asking to receive treatment at 
home. He states his breathing is improved. He reports fevers and 
chills, but denies nausea or vomiting. Continues to have 
diarrhea, but abdominal pain improved.

IMAGING/STUDIES: 
================
___ CXR Portable
IMPRESSION:  
Decreased lung volumes compared to prior.  Mild pulmonary edema, 
new in the
interval.  Patchy right basilar opacity may reflect atelectasis, 
but infection is not excluded in the correct clinical setting. 

___ CXR Portable 
IMPRESSION:
Mild CHF. Possibility of superimposed infectious/inflammatory 
infiltrates cannot be excluded, particularly given asymmetry in 
appearance between the right and left lungs.  The differential 
diagnosis includes PCP ___. No gross effusion. 

___ CTA CHEST
IMPRESSION: 
1. No evidence of pulmonary embolism to the segmental levels.  
Evaluation of the subsegmental levels is limited by respiratory 
motion. 
2. Ground-glass opacities in the bilateral upper lobes and right 
middle lobe are consistent with underlying infection.  This 
appearance is potentially consistent with PCP/PJP in the setting 
of low CD4 counts. 
3. Smooth interlobular septal thickening in the bilateral lung 
apices is 
suggestive of background interstitial edema.  No pleural 
effusion. 
4. Possible pulmonary arterial hypertension. 

___ RUQ US
IMPRESSION: 
1. Prominent CBD measuring 9 mm is similar to ___. 
2. Distended gallbladder, without wall thickening or 
pericholecystic fluid, may be due to fasting. 
3. Minimal gallbladder sludge. 
4. Possible small right pleural effusion. 

___ CXR Portable
IMPRESSION:  
Interval worsening of the perihilar opacities, rapid worsening 
favors 
superimposed edema however, worsening infection can also be 
considered given upper lobe distribution. 

___ TTE
The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall 
thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is 
normal. There is mild global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF 
= 45-50 %). There is no ventricular septal defect. Right 
ventricular chamber size is normal with borderline normal free 
wall function. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally 
normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis or 
aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve appears structurally 
normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. The pulmonary artery 
systolic pressure could not be determined. There is a small 
pericardial effusion. There are no echocardiographic signs of 
tamponade.

___ CXR
Since the prior radiograph of 1 day earlier, pulmonary edema has 
substantially improved and bilateral pleural effusions have 
markedly decreased in size.  Additionally, a nonspecific opacity 
in the left retrocardiac region has decreased in extent, 
probably representing an area of atelectasis.

syphilis, disseminated VZV, and medication non-compliance who 
presented to PCP ___ ___ abdominal pain and fatigue 
admitted to the MICU ___ altered mental status and fevers 
concerning for MAC vs neurosyphilis, who then eloped from ___ 
on ___ and then re-presented to the ED later the same day with 
dyspnea and tachycardia, re-admitted to the MICU due to concerns 
for sepsis. 

#Severe sepsis: etiology unclear. The patient re-presented with 
worsening SOB found to be tachypneic with RR in ___, febrile to 
102 with CXR demonstrating new pulmonary edema and patchy right 
basilar opacity. Concern initially for PCP pneumonia given low 
CD4 count, elevated LDH and new RLL infiltrate versus 
disseminated MAC. Disseminated MAC was also felt to be high on 
the DDX given abdominal pain, diarrhea, SOB, low CD4, and 
pancytopenia. Differential also included aspiration 
pneumonia/pneumonitis given recent AMS, HCAP pneumonia. Patient 
had CTA chest concerning for PNA (negative for PE). Patient was 
treated with broad spectrum coverage, including IV Bactrim for 
PCP PNA, vancomycin/ceftriaxone for HCAP (ceftriaxone at 2g IV 
q12h to cover neurosyphilis dosing), azithromycin and ethambutol 
for MAC, acyclovir IV to cover for HSV encephalitis (unable to 
perform LP given thrombocytopenia), and fluconazole as 
prophylaxis. He had blood cultures with no growth to date on 
discharge, UCx no growth, histoplasma, legionella, hepatitis C 
Ab negative, hepatitis B consistent with immunization, stool O+P 
negative, negative induced sputum for AFB. There was inadequate 
sample to analyze for PCP, ___. Patient was intubated 
for his respiratory distress and in preparation for 
bronchoscopy. He underwent bronchoscopy on ___ which was 
largely unremarkable. BAL was obtained and was negative for PCP, 
___, and AFB. CMV from BAL showed (+) IgG, consistent with 
known previous infection. Although PCP was negative on BAL, 
given patient's hemodynamic instability, Bactrim was continued. 
On ___, patient became progressively hypotensive and had to be 
started on levophed for pressure support. Antibiotic coverage 
was broadened to cefepime from ceftriaxone. He received IVF and 
was able to be weaned from pressors. He was continued on broad 
spectrum therapy and his respiratory status improved. Following 
extubation, he was transferred to the floor. He completed x14 
days of CTX/acyclovir. MAC culture with no growth and 
azithromycin/ethambutol were stopped. He was discharged on 
prophylaxis with Bactrim/azithromycin. 

#Hypoxemic respiratory failure: Patient was initially intubated 
in order to undergo bronchoscopy. He remained intubated given 
concern that he would need ERCP to evaluate for possible AIDS 
cholangiopathy. However, he was able to be extubated after 
approx. 48 hours. He shortly became hypoxic with tachypnea and 
required reintubation. CXR at that time showed significant 
pulmonary edema, for which he was diuresed. He was able to be 
extubated and his respiratory status improved. He was stable on 
room air for x3 days prior to discharge. 

#Pancytopenia: On prior admission, had new thrombocytopenia of 
51 from prior plt >150 with associated leukopenia and relative 
anemia (HgB currently 10.1). Initially thought to be secondary 
to possible disseminated MAC in a patient with HIV although it 
would be rare for all cell lines to be down. The patient has not 
been compliant with medications and therefore medication effect 
is unlikely to be the cause. Patient was notable to be positive 
for EBV on prior admission, which may explain cytopenias. Given 
low reticulocyte count and pancytopenia, may be due to 
myeloinfiltrative process. Patient required plt transfusion for 
procedures during his hospital course. He was continued on broad 
spectrum coverage; his cell lines were monitored and uptrended. 
 
#HIV with AIDS: Previously on Trizivir, followed by TDF/Combivir 
(___) took Truvada/Reyataz/r switched to Darunavir/r, Truvada. 
Patient has not been taking his home medications for unclear 
reasons; he states that he has "unstable housing" as the reason 
for non-compliance, although currently domiciled. HIV VL on 
recent admission was ___ with CD4 count 14. He was followed 
by ID and HAART was resumed with truvada and dolutegravir and he 
was initiated on Bactrim/azithromycin ppx as above.

#Neurosyphilis: Patient has a history of neurosyphillis and is 
s/p treatment with IV PCN x3, most recently in ___ and weekly 
IM PCN ___. Last seen by ___ ID ___ when suspicion was 
high for recurrent neurosyphilis based on visual symptoms and 
RPR titers. He was recommended for PICC placement and repeat PCN 
course. However, pt declined PICC for IV PCN and so received IM 
with probenecid. RPR on last admission was elevated at 1:128 and 
ID recommended continuing ceftriaxone (initiated empirically as 
above for sepsis) and patient was planned to go home on 
penicillin via PICC. However, patient eloped before ___ was 
placed and he refused IM PCN prior to leaving. This admission, 
he was treated with ceftriaxone 2g IV q12h as above and PICC was 
placed on ___. He completed x14d course of ceftriaxone. 
 
#Hyponatremia: Patient presented with Na+ 127 on prior 
admission, and was 125 on this admission. Initially felt to be 
likely hypovolemic in the setting of sepsis and poor po intake. 
Na initially improved with IVF, however downtrended again. 
Ulytes and osm c/w SIADH last admission and was placed on 750cc 
fluid restriction and salt tabs. Given concern for worsening 
infection this admission, IVF restriction was liberalized and 
salt tabs discontinued. His sodium was stable prior to 
discharge. 

#Abdominal pain: On prior admission, patient presented with LLQ 
pain with initial concern for underlying infection/reactive LAD 
given fevers and low CD4 count. CT abd/pelvis without e/o 
colitis or lymphadenopathy. Did show intrahepatic biliary 
dilatation and mild dilatation of the common bile duct, but LFTs 
not suggestive of biliary pathology and patient denied RUQ pain. 
CMV viral load was negative. Stool cultures, C. Diff, and O and 
P negative. Stool AFB pending. He has a history of H. pylori 
which has been responsive to PPI and triple therapy per report 
but unlikely to present with LLQ pain. His abdominal pain 
improved during his hospitalization. 

#Major depressive disorder: patient previously on sertraline, 
paroxetine but has not been taking recently. He received BZD 
intermittently during hospitalization; he was discharged on his 
home klonopin with plan to consider restarting antidepressants 
as an outpatient.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
[] Multiple fungal studies pending at discharge
[] Consider restarting anti-depressants
[] Consider transitioning to one pill HAART regimen

homeless, with a recent human bite to the left lower leg, who 
presented to his ___ primary care provider with ___ 
fever to 101.8, and tachycardia, arthralgias, mild headache, 
chronic neck pain, and mild dyspnea.  He was admitted to ___ 
for further care.  Multiple tests were sent as noted below, a 
lumbar puncture was performed, he was treated with empiric 
antimicrobials.  However, the day after admission (___) he 
was very anxious to leave the hospital, and felt like all of his 
symptoms had resolved.  Despite being counseled about the risks 
of leaving before a clear diagnosis had been made, the patient 
was insistent and we felt he had capacity to make this decision. 
 As a result of this, he left against medical advice (AMA).  We 
arranged close follow-up with his primary care physician for the 
next morning, ___ at 8:40 AM as described below.  Prior to 
discharge I reviewed the risks of leaving with him, the pending 
test results, his medications, and the follow-up plan.  I also 
called and spoke with ___ to coordinate care.

#History of fever, malaise, dyspnea and cough, and headache
#HAART
–All of these were of unclear etiology, and by the time I met 
him on the day of discharge, all of these symptoms had resolved
–He had no fevers whatsoever in the hospital, he had no dyspnea 
or cough during my entire time with him in the ___ 
isolation room
–He was evaluated with routine blood tests, blood cultures, 
urine Legionella and urine strep pneumo antigen, urine culture, 
induced sputum's for acid-fast bacteria, and a lumbar puncture, 
with fluid sent for cryptococcal antigen, culture, and HSV PCR
–As noted in the results section of this discharge summary most 
of those tests were negative, the remaining being no growth to 
date, and only a few pending at the time of discharge
–The patient was felt to be at low risk for active pulmonary 
tuberculosis: Despite his history of fever, dyspnea, cough, he 
had none of those symptoms on the day of discharge, his chest 
x-ray was normal, and it was noted that his HIV while not 
optimally controlled, had most recently been noted to have a CD4 
count of greater than 200 (repeat CD4 count was pending at the 
time of discharge).  Regardless, all of his acid-fast smears 
were negative.
-Patient was not discharged with any antibiotics as a result of 
all these tests, and has close follow-up with his PCP
–He will continue with his highly active anti-retroviral 
therapy, as well as his other home medications including dapsone
–The patient requested loperamide on discharge given that 
broad-spectrum antibiotics have previously given him loose 
stools, so he was provided with a prescription for this 
medication

Although it is AGAINST MEDICAL ADVICE, I feel that the patient 
has capacity to make the decision to leave the hospital, and 
that it is not putting himself or others at significant risk for 
him to leave.

I spent [ ] <30min; [x] >30min in discharge day management 
services.

History of Present Illness:
Mr. ___ is a ___ year old man with HIV (CD4 ___,000 in ___ on ___ since ___ who presents with 
several weeks of escalating intermittent RUQ pain. He has been 
having intermittent episodes of stabbing/burning RUQ pain 
associated with nausea and nonbilious emesis intermittently for 
a couple of months now. Initially, these episodes were 
infrequent and relatively mild; they would resolve spontaneously 
in less than an hour, especially with prn ranitidine. He feels 
that they have been particularly brought on by "heavy" fatty 
meals, and the pain/nausea/vomitting have been waking him 
suddenly from sleep. The frequency and severity of these 
episodes has been gradually escalating over this time, but 
particularly over the past week. They also seem to be less 
associated with any sort of food. On the day of admission, he 
had severe RUQ pain which did not remit, causing him to get in a 
taxi to come to the ED; he estimates this episode lasted at 
least four hours prior to resolving with the morphine he was 
given in the ED.  
.  
Of note, he does endorse an unintentional 15 lbs weight loss 
over the past month; he feels that he looks more gaunt in the 
mirror and that his clothes are fitting more loosely. He denies 
any jaundice or scleral icterus.  
.  
Also of note, he has been having frequent myalgias and 
arthralgias upon waking in the morning, especially in his 
legs/knees; this usually responds to over the counter 
analgesics. He also reports generalized fatigue, malaise, and 
weakness for several months now.  
.  
ED Course:  
Upon arrival to the ___ ED, he was afebrile, BP 109/76, HR 
100, RR 18, Sat 99% on room air. He was given 4 mg of IV 
ondansetron and 4 mg of IV morphine which eventually relieved 
his pain; he was also given 3000 cc of normal saline. A RUQ 
ultrasound was normal but an abdominal CT scan showed possible 
gallbladder distension; the ERCP team was consulted who 
recommended MRCP for evaluation.  
.  
ROS:  
He reports subjective warmth and clamminess with these episodes 
of abdominal pain. He gets occasional mild frontal headaches. 
Denies any chills or rigors. Weight loss as above. He denies 
chest pain, dyspnea, ankle edema, diarrhea. He does have 
occasional constipation. He also reports new mild oral thrush 
and new scaly pink lesions on the soles of his feet for the past 
month.

Discharge Disposition:
Home
 
Discharge Diagnosis:
Primary: 
RUQ abdominal pain 
Indirect bilirubinemia of unknown etiology, possibly ___ 
syndrome 
Secondary: 
HIV 

 
Discharge Condition:
Pain controlled, stable. Afebrile.

 
Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted to the hospital for evaluation of right upper 
quadrant abdominal pain. CT scan of your abdomen showed possibly 
distended gall bladder, and lab tests showed high total 
bilirubin level which can indicate a blockage in the biliary 
system. An MRCP was done, which was normal. The liver and 
biliary system were normal, with no obstruction, stones or 
lesions. There was an incidental finding of a small lymphatic 
malformation which is of no clinical significance. Although 
these preliminary findings are reassuring, please follow up with 
your primary care physician for the final read. 
.
If you develop worsening pain, fever, chills, nausea, vomiting 
or any other concerning symptoms, please call your primary care 
doctor or return to the emergency room.

admitted to the MICU ___ altered mental status and fevers 
concerning for MAC vs neurosyphilis. Patient eloped from the 
hospital on ___ after verbalizing understanding of the risks 
associated with leaving including worsening infection and death.

# Elopement: on the morning of ___, patient eloped from the 
hospital. Patient verbalized understanding of risks/benefits 
associated with leaving, including risk of worsening infection 
and death. He received counseling and prescriptions for his 
medications including his HAART medications and antibiotics. He 
left before getting IM PCN or discharge paperwork. A message was 
left for his roommate/HCP. He and his roommate were encouraged 
to come back to the ED with any concerns. An appointment was 
scheduled for patient with his PCP.

MICU COURSE:
===================================
#Sepsis: Patient presented with WBC < 4, Tm 103 in the ED, 
tachycardia in 130s concerning for sepsis. No elevated lactate 
to suggest severe sepsis. The etiology is suspected to be MAC, 
mycotic blood cultures pending on elopement. The differential 
for his infectious etiology is generally broad, given recent CD4 
count <100 with HIV VL >14K in ___. CT A/P is without 
evidence of intra-abdominal infection, unremarkable for abscess 
or colitis; while there was suggestion of CBD and intrahepatic 
biliary dilatation, LFTs wnl do not support biliary etiology of 
sepsis. CXR is without evidence of pneumonia although given 
vague complaints of SOB and low CD4, MAC is suspected. CT head 
negative for obvious abscess or ring-enhancing lesion. LP was 
initially deferred given thrombocytopenia with plt in ___ and 
exam reassuring for no evidence of meningismus. However, the 
decision was made with ID input that patient should undergo LP 
to r/o CSF infection; however, patient adamantly declined and so 
LP not performed. Given this, he underwent CT head with contrast 
which did not show any concerning findings for infection, no 
ring-enhancing lesions or abscess noted. Flu negative, monospot 
negative, CMV negative, blood cx pending. In the ED, he 
initially received vanc, Zosyn, ceftriaxone, acyclovir, and 
fluconazole, which was narrowed to ceftriaxone in conjunction 
with ID. Ultimately, suspicion was highest for MAC, and so 
patient was placed on azithromcyin and Ethambutol for ? 
disseminated MAC. Acyclovir IV was discontinued given low 
suspicion for HSV encephalitis.

#Abdominal pain: unclear etiology although infection was 
initially suspected given fevers. Given localization to LLQ on 
exam, would be concerned about reactive lymphadenopathy although 
no significant LAD seen on CT abd/pelvis. CT abd/pelvis does 
show intrahepatic biliary dilatation and mild dilatation of the 
common bile duct although LFTs do not suggest biliary pathology 
as discussed above. Patient does have a history of H. pylori 
which has been responsive to PPI and triple therapy per report. 
CMV esophagitis vs colitis is possible although no significant 
diarrhea. CMV viral load was negative. He was continued on 
ceftriaxone as above. Stool cultures were pending at discharge. 

#Thrombocytopenia: pt presented with plt 51 from prior plt >150. 
Unclear etiology although suspected secondary to infection. 
Medication effect (e.g. Bactrim) less likely given patient not 
taking any medications as an outpatient. Consumption is possible 
in setting of acute infection. Pt does have mild splenomegaly on 
CT abd/pelvis making sequestration possible explanation. DIC 
less likely given normal coags. Prior records from ___ reveal 
prior plt 175. Most likely in the setting of disseminated MAC 
infection, sepsis. Per ID, would consider heme-onc consult if 
thrombocytopenia continues to worsen. Platelet count was 14 on 
elopement
 
#HIV with AIDS: Previously on Trizivir, followed by TDF/Combivir 
(___) took Truvada/Reyataz/r switched to Darunavir/r, Truvada. 
Patient has not been taking his home medications for unclear 
reasons; he states that he has "unstable housing" as the reason 
for non-compliance, although currently domiciled. HIV VL this 
admission was ___ with CD4 count 14. He was followed by ID and 
HAART was resumed with truvada and dolutegravir. He was 
initiated on fluconazole/atovaquone/acyclovir ppx.

#Neurosyphilis: Patient has a history of neurosyphillis and is 
s/p treatment with IV PCN x3, most recently in ___ and weekly 
IM PCN ___. Last seen by ___ ID ___ when suspicion was 
high for recurrent neurosyphilis based on visual symptoms and 
RPR titers. He was recommended for PICC placement and repeat PCN 
course. However, pt declined PICC for IV PCN and so received IM 
with probenecid. RPR this admission was elevated at 1:128 and ID 
recommended continuing ceftriaxone (initiated empirically as 
above for sepsis) and patient was planned to go home on 
penicillin via PICC. However, patient eloped before PICC was 
placed and he refused IM PCN prior to leaving. 

#Hyponatremia: Patient presented with Na+ 127 on admission. This 
was felt to be likely hypovolemic in the setting of sepsis and 
poor po intake. Na+ improved with IVF. However, Ulytes and osm 
were consistent with SIADH, and bedside U/S showed adequate 
volume resuscitation with given IVC. Given improvement in HD 
status, the patient was placed on 750cc fluid restriction and 
salt tabs. Na improved to 128 upon transfer to the floor. Na on 
elopement of 128.

#Major depressive disorder: patient previously on sertraline, 
paroxetine but has not been taking recently. These were not 
re-initiated this hospital course but should consider resuming

Brief Hospital Course:
Patient is a ___ with history of HIV (inconsistent HAART 
therapy, most recent CD4 from late ___ 278) who presented 
due to GPRs growing in ___ bottles from ___ (aerobic bottle) 
after a recent hospitalization for fevers/tachycardia (left 
AMA). The GPRs speciated as corynebacterium (diphtheroids), most 
consistent with a contaminant. Patient was initially started on 
vancomycin/ampicillin, though subsequently remained 
hemodynamically stable off all antibiotics for more than 
24hours. Subsequent blood cultures showed NGTD. 

=============
ACUTE ISSUES:
=============

#SUBJECTIVE FEVERS - Patient was recently treated for a human 
bite sustained within the past several weeks (completed an 
appropriate course of augmentin). Symptoms have reportedly 
included fever/sweats, malaise, dyspnea, cough, and headaches - 
of note, patient was appearing well and only complaining of mild 
shortness of breath during this admission. Broad infectious 
work-up from recent admission ___ was largely unremarkable 
other than ___ bottles positive for GPRs (speciated as 
corynebacterium/diphtheroids), which was considered to be most 
likely a contaminant and not representative of a true pathogen. 
T-lymphocyte subset subsequently returned, CD4 301. Of note, 
recent CSF studies showed 66RBC in tube 4 and elevated protein 
(53, possibly related to underlying HIV), HSV PCR NEGATIVE. 
Patient remained afebrile throughout admission, was initially 
started on vancomycin/ampicillin (treating enterococcus in urine 
in addition to the possibility of listeria), though remained 
afebrile after discontinuation ___. Of note UA was unremarkable 
and patient denied any urinary symptoms, ___ CFU 
enterococcus grew from UCx ___.
[] Complete 7 day course of Macrobid for Enterococcus UTI

#SINUS TACHYCARDIA - Ongoing tachycardia, largely asymptomatic 
other
than mild SOB, which patient attributed to the humid clime. No 
clinical concern for DVT at this time (NB patient has a hx of 
PICC associated DVT). Patient was monitored on telemetery 
throughout admission. Trop/BNP unremarkable. TSH returned at 2.9 
Patient was given 1L IVF bolus, HRs persistently 90-low 100s. No 
further issues this admission. 

#WEIGHT LOSS
Patient reports approximately 10 pound unintentional weight loss 
over the past month despite trying to eat more. Nutrition was 
consulted, though unfortunately could not see patient over the 
weekend. Further work-up as an outpatient, ensure age 
appropriate cancer screening.

#HIV
On HAART therapy, last ___ 278, previously drawn 
T-lymphcyte subset ___ returned with CD4 301. HIV viral load 
1.5. He was continued on home dolutegravir 50mg PO daily and 
descovy 200mg-25mg PO daily
[] Discontinued Dapsone given CD4 of 301

#NORMOCYTIC ANEMIA
Hb 11.2 on admission, at recent baseline. No bleeding and 
patient remained hemodynamically stable. Improved sinus 
tachycardia as above. Iron studies showed Fe 92, Fe sat 30.7%. 
Outpatient colonoscopy should be arranged for age appropriate 
cancer screening.

#LFT ABNORMALITY
AST 48 ALT 13 on admission, most likely ___ hemolysis, 
subsequently wnl. Prior heavy EtOH use, though not recently. 
___ viral hepatology labs showed positive HCV Ab. Coags 
unremarkable. HCV viral load pending at time of discharge.
[] f/u HCV viral load

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,
  
It was a pleasure taking part in your care here at ___!  

Why was I admitted to the hospital?  
-You were admitted because one of the blood cultures from your 
recent admission returned positive, raising the possibility of a 
serious blood stream infection (bacteremia). 

What was done for me while I was in the hospital?  
- You were started on antibiotics to treat the possible blood 
stream infection, however, these were stopped as we learned that 
the positive blood culture was more likely the result of a 
contaminant (sometimes harmless bacteria from the skin can 
accidentally make its way into the microbiology lab).
- You were given intravenous fluids for a fast heart rate, which 
improved during your stay. 
- Your CD4 count returned at 301. 
- You were found to have a urinary tract infection, and started 
on antibiotics for this.

What should I do when I leave the hospital?  
-Please continue to take all of your medications as prescribed, 
you have not been started on any new medications.  It is very 
important that you take you HIV medications every day.
-Please be sure to schedule an appointment with your primary 
care doctor this week for ___.

Sincerely,  
Your ___ Care Team
