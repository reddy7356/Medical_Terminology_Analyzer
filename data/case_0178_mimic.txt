Brief Hospital Course:

LAD in ___, systolic heart failure with EF 35-40%, HTN, and HL 
who presented with his anginal equivalent. 

# Chest pain: Reported several episodes of chest pain, 
momentarily relieved by nitroglycerin. He reported that he had 
missed one day of his aspirin/plavix.  EKG showing nonspecific 
changes (T wave inversions in V2-5, st depressions in V3-5), 
similar to prior EKGs since ___.  No new EKG changes with 
troponins negative x3.  There was some concern for stent 
restenosis, so cardiac catheterization was performed which 
revealed only mild restentosis of the BMS without acute 
occlusion.  A large aneurysm of the RCA was also noted.  He was 
medically optimized with the addition of lisinopril 2.5mg qhs to 
his current regimen of ASA 81, metoprolol succinate 25mg daily,

___ which showed an excellent cardiopulmonary response to 
exercise even while on metoprolol.  He is going to follow up 
with his cardiologist, Dr. ___ week.
