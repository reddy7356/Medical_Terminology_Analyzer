Pertinent Results:
Intra-op echo ___
PRE-BYPASS: 
The left atrium is dilated. No spontaneous echo contrast or 
thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium/left atrial 
appendage or the body of the right atrium/right atrial 
appendage. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color 
Doppler.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal 
cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. 
The aortic root is markedly dilated at the sinus level. The 
ascending aorta is markedly dilated upto the mid level. The 
aortic arch is mildly dilated. The descending thoracic aorta is 
mildly dilated. There are three aortic valve leaflets. 
Midsystolic closure of the aortic valve leaflets is not seen 
Moderate (2+) aortic regurgitation is seen. 
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial mitral 
regurgitation is seen. There is no pericardial effusion. Dr. 
___ was notified in person of the results on ___.
POST-BYPASS: 
preserved biventricular systolic function.LVEF 55%.The aortic 
valve and the conduit are in place and functioning well. The 
residual peak and mean gradients are 8 and 4mm of Hg 
respectively.Minimal MR, TR and PI.
The thoracic aorta is intact.

Brief Hospital Course:
He was transferred from an outside hospital for evaluation of 
the ascending aortic aneurysm found incidentially on 
echocardiogram.  He underwent preoperative workup that included 
a CT scan and echocardiogram.  His medications were adjusted for 
blood pressure management and episodes of atrial fibrillation 
and junctional rhythm.  
On ___ he was brought to the Operating Room and underwent a 
Bentall procedure with a 29 mm mechanical ___ aortic valve 
conduit.  See operative report for further details.  He received 
vancomycin for perioperative antibiotics.  He weaned from bypass 
on Neo Synephrine and Propofol infusions and transferred to the 
intensive care unit for post operative management.  

In the first ___ hours he was weaned from sedationand 
pressors, awoke neurologically intact and was extubated without 
complications.  On post operative day one he was started on 
Coumadin for his mechanical valve and transferred to the floor.  
Chest tubes and pacing wires were discontinued without 
complication according to prootocol.  Physical Therapy worked 
with him on strength and mobility. He was placed on continuous 
O2 sat monitoring and found to be desaturating at nighttime, the 
Sleep Medicine Service was consulted (see note). He had a CPAP 
trial and did not desaturate.  They recommended he be discharged 
home on oxygen, but not CPAP.  He will follow up with the sleep 
clinic as an outpatient.  On postoperative day three he was 
started on Heparin to bridge until his INR was therapuetic.  He 
continued to have dysrhythmia and EP was consulted.  EP 
diagnosed sinus arrest with junctional escape rhythm v. atrial 
fibrillation with junctional escape rhythm,  most likely due to 
post-op inflammation/edema of the conduction system.  AV 
conduction was found to be intact, thus a pacemaker was not 
indicated.  

Beta blocker was titrated carefully, and rhythm was mostly sinus 
by time of discharge.  When the INR became therapeutic the 
Heparin was stopped anfd the INR goal was 2.5-3.5.  The patient 
was discharged home in good condition with ___ services on POD 
8.  

Arrangements were made for his primary care physician 
(___) to manage his anticoagulation. Follow up 
appointments, restrictions, precautions and medications were 
discussed with him prior to discharge.
