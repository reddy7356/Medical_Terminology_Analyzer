   FLUID CULTURE (Preliminary): 
      Reported to and read back by ___ ___ ___ 1040AM. 
      STAPH AUREUS COAG +.    RARE GROWTH. 

___ 1:00 am BLOOD CULTURE

   Blood Culture, Routine (Preliminary): 
      STAPH AUREUS COAG +. 
         Consultations with ID are recommended for all blood 
cultures
         positive for Staphylococcus aureus, yeast or other 
fungi. 
         FINAL SENSITIVITIES. 
         Staphylococcus species may develop resistance during 
prolonged
         therapy with quinolones.   Therefore, isolates that are 
initially
         susceptible may become resistant within three to four 
days after
         initiation of therapy.  Testing of repeat isolates may 
be
         warranted. 

                              SENSITIVITIES: MIC expressed in 
MCG/ML

___. 

L Knee XR:
IMPRESSION: Large joint effusion. No acute fracture detected. If 
there is high 
clinical concern for a radiographically-occult fracture, then 
MRI could help 
for further assessment. 

R Foot XR:
IMPRESSION: 
  
Periosteal reaction along the third metatarsal which can be seen 
with 
osteomyelitis, correlation with the site of the patient's known 
ulcer is 
recommended.  MRI is more sensitive for the detection of 
osteomyelitis.
