___ yo w/ hx of celiac and IBS 3.5 months post-partum presenting 
with 3 months of worsening abdominal pain, nausea and loose 
stools.
.
Fever:  Patient initially presented to the ED after having had a 
temperature of 101 at home in the setting of abdominal pain, 
bright red blood in her stool and nausea.  Upon arrival to the 
ED patient's symptoms had largely resolved and she was afebrile. 
 She was given IV fluids and admitted where she was presistantly 
afebrile.  Stool cultures were sent and were pending at the time 
of discharge, but given long standing symptoms over several 
months infeciton was of low likelihood.  
.
GI Distress: patient reports several months worth of abdominal 
pain, nausea, rare vomitting and loose stools.  all of these 
symptoms were consistant with her history of celiac disease.  No 
correlation could be made however between specific events and 
the patient's waxing and waning symptoms.  Infectious etiology 
was evlauated but was not considered very likely as symptoms had 
been persistant for several months.  Inflammatory markers were 
sent and were not elevated.  Etiologies such as diet refractory 
celiac, coconiment lactose intolerance, bacterial overgrowth, 
undiagnosed inflammatory bowel disease, pancreatic insufficency, 
or villous atrophy.  LFTs were normal, but given history of 
tatooing hepatitis serologies were sent.  Will require 
additional outpatient follow up with primary care and 
gastroenterology.  
.
Bloody Stool:  Patient complained of occasional blood in her 
stool prior to presentation.  Her stools in house were heme 
negative and her symptoms felt to either be due to an 
inflammatory bowel process (unlikely as low inflammatory 
markers) vs irriation of her known internal hemmrhoids.
.
Dizziness:  patient's discription was not suggestive of BPV and 
sounded more consistant with occasional low perfusion.  Fluid 
loss from diarrhea was a possibility and patient was given IV 
fluids.  Not orthostatic currently.
.
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:  
-Patient had pending stool and hepatitis serologies pending at 
the time of discharge that will need to followed up by her PCP.
