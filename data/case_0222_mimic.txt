(not fluid overload). She notes no cough, and no palpitations.  
.  
Also of note, patient was admitted at ___ from 
___ w/ rhabdo from gemfibrozil and atovastatin, though 
her baseline creatinine appears to be around 1.1-1.3.

Imaging:
CHEST, PA AND LATERAL: The heart is upper limits of normal in 
size, with a mildly unfolded aorta. The lungs are clear. No 
pleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified.

CTA torso:
IMPRESSION: 
1. No evidence of aortic dissection. 
2. Dependent atelectases in the lung bases. 
3. A 3-mm pulmonary nodule in the right middle lobe. In the 
absence of any risk factors for intrathoracic malignancy, no 
further followup for this is necessary. Otherwise, followup 
chest CT in 12 months. 
4. Small hiatal hernia. 
5. Moderately distended bladder. 
6. Right thyroid nodule. 

P-MIBI:
1. Probable reversible, medium sized, mild perfusion defect 
involving the LAD territory in the setting of breast 
attenuation. 
2. Normal left ventricular cavity size and systolic function. 

C. Cath:
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:     
1. No obstructive coronary artery disease. 
2. Elevated left sided filling pressures. 
3. Severe hypertension. 
4. Normal bilateral renal arteries. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ y/oF with diabetes and HTN presenting with progressive 
dyspnea on exertion and chest pain, as well as reversible 
defects in LAD distribution on P-MIBI.  
.  
# Noncardiac Chest pain: On admission, patient with dyspnea on 
exertion (chronic x weeks) and chest pain, as well as reversible 
lesion in LAD on P-MIBI. Concern for unstable angina in light of 
two episodes pain at rest. She had three sets cardiac enzymes 
negative, and ECG with old LBBB, no ST/T-wave changes. She was 
prehydrated and received mucomyst in light of renal failure, and 
then had cardiac catheterization. Cardiac catheterization was 
normal (see above), and there was no evidence of renal artery 
stenosis. She will continue to be worked up as an outpatient for 
her shortness of breath.
.  
# Acute on Chronic Renal Insufficiency - Creatinines of 0.8 to 
0.9 upon d/c from ___ in ___, but baseline of 1.1-1.3 
in our system. On admission, creatinine of 1.5, likely secondary 
to dehydration. On discharge, creatinine improved to 1.2.  Home 
ACEi, ___, and lasix were continued on discharge.
.  
# Diabetes:  Covered with humalog sliding scale while inpt. Home 
oral hypoglycemics restarted on discharge. 
.  
# Hypertension: Patient with SBP in 190's upon arrival to the 
floors, likely in the setting of not receiving BP meds in ED. 
SBP's improved to 120's-150's during hospitalization with 
resumption of home regimen. Metoprolol and doxazosin were 
switched to single agent carvedilol, and patient tolerated well. 
Unclear why patient on diltiazem instead of amlodipine, and 
reason for both ACEi and ___, in the setting of lisinopril not 
maxed out dose. Could also consider switching from lasix to HCTZ 
as outpatient if no contraindication. Should follow up with PCP 
regarding hypertensive meds, but no other changes other than 
change to carvedilol were made on this discharge.

# Pulmonary nodule: 3mm pulm nodule on CTA. Recommended that in 
the absence of malignancy risk (which she does not appear to 
have), no further imaging needed. Otherwise requires f/u CT in ___ 
year.
