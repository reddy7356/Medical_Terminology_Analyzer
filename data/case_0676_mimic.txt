 IMAGING AND KEY STUDIES
==========================
CT C-SPINE WITHOUT CONTRAST: No fracture or malalignment.  ET 
and OG tubes in place.
 
CT HEAD WITHOUT CONTRAST ___: No acute intracranial 
process.
 
CXR ___: Possible small bulla at the left lung apex again 
noted.  No pneumothorax identified.  Doubt CHF.  No focal 
infiltrate or gross effusion.  No displaced rib fracture 
detected. 
 
CXR ___: 2 portable supine chest radiographs performed 90 
minutes. dd on the first exam, an endotracheal tube is seen 
terminating approximately 3 cm above the carina.  On the second 
radiograph performed 90 minutes later, there is no change in the 
position of the tip of the endotracheal tube.  Nasogastric tube 
terminates in the left upper quadrant.  Lungs are clear.  
Cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.  Bony structures are 
intact.    IMPRESSION:  As above.  ET tube positioned 
appropriately. 

MRI Brain ___
There are no acute intracranial findings. 
Paranasal sinus disease with suggestion of acute right maxillary 
sinusitis. Suggestion of nasal septal perforation. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
 ___ male ___ post-concussive syndrome s/p auto vs ped 
accident ___ who presents with seizure after head trauma in 
setting of EtOH and cocaine use. He was intubated for airway 
protection, EEG was performed for 24 hours and MRI was performed 
to rule out structural causes. He also had anion gap metabolic 
acidosis, elevated lactate and acute kidney injury which 
resolved with IVF. He will follow-up with neurology as an 
outpatient.
 
=============================
 ACTIVE ISSUES
=============================
#Seizure: occurred secondary to trauma, Non-contrast head CT 
without acute intracranial process. Other considerations include 
cocaine/crack cocaine intoxication, EtOH withdrawal (unclear how 
much he drinks and BAL 157). Intubated for airway protection ___ 
extubated ___ without incident. EEG was performed for 24 hours 
and MRI was performed to rule out structural causes. Both were 
negative. He will follow-up with neurology as an outpatient. He 
was not started on AEDs due to provoked seizure. 

=============================
 RESOLVED ISSUES
=============================
#Anion Gap Metabolic Acidosis: ___ lactic acidosis from seizure, 
hypovolemia, cocaine. Osm Gap 2.4. Resolved with IVF. 
  
#EtOH Abuse: BAL 150 on admission. Received precedex while 
intubated, was monitored for signs of withdrawal with CIWA scale 
on diazepam. 
 
#Cocaine Use: troponin negative. Social work consulted. 

#Acute kidney injury: Cr. 1.4 from unknown baseline resolved to 
1.0. Likely multifactorial from seizure and cocaine use, CK 
trended to peak, resolved with IVF. 
 
#Hematuria: possibly ___ myoglobinuria from urine dipstick from 
cocaine induced myolysis versus true from trauma.  CK was 
trended and stable in 800s, hemoglobin and hematocrit were 
stable as well. 
 
#Carboxyhemoglobinemia: COHb 8, typically smokes 6 cig a day 
declined smoking cessation counseling or nicotine replacement 
while hospitalized.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,

You were admitted to ___ ___ ___ after you 
had a seizure caused by hitting your head.  You had to have a 
tube inserted to help you breath.

While you were here you were monitored for seizures and an MRI 
of your brain was performed to ensure there was no other cause 
of your seizure. 

Now that you are leaving the hospital:
- follow-up with neurology as scheduled 
- stop using cocaine, it can increase your risk of brain injury 
or heart attack

It was a pleasure taking care of you

-Your ___ Team
 
Followup Instructions:
___
