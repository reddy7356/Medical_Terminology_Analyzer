CARDIAC CATH:
COMMENTS:      
1. Coronary angiography in this right dominant system revealed 
two 
vessel coronary artery disease. The LMCA had no significant 
disease. The 
LAD was totally occluded at the mid segment. The OM1 stent was 
known 
occluded. The distal LCxs stent was occluded at its distal edge. 
The 
distal OM beyond the stent filled by R>L collaterals. 
2. Arterial conduit angiography revealed the LIMA to be widely 
patent. 
The SVGs were not engaged as known to be occluded. 
3. Successful PTCA of the distal LCX stent with a 2.0x15 Voyager 
balloon 
and a 2.25x15mm Quantum Maverick balloon. Final angiography 
revealed no 
residual stenosis, no angiographically apparent dissection and 
TIMI III 
flow (see ___ comments). 
  
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:     
1. Two vessel coronary artery disease. 
2. Patent LIMA to LAD. 
3. Successful PTCA Of the LCX. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ with history of CAD s/p CABG and PCI, DM, HTN p/w 
CP.  
  
## Chest pain: Patient's chest pain complaints were more 
consistent with MSK pain than cardiac ischemia.  Her cardiac 
enzymes were negative but given her significant cardiac history, 
she was taken to cardiac catheterization.  There, she was found 
to have total occlusion of her left circumflex and PTCA was 
performed, with successful dilation of the artery.  No stent was 
placed.  She was discharged on a BB, statin, ASA, and 
clopidogrel, all of which she was already taking at the time of 
admission.  

## Diabetes mellitus: Patient has insulin dependent diabetes and 
her HbA1C was 10% at time of admission, suggesting poor glucose 
control.  This is her most significant cardiac risk factor that 
is not currently medically managed optimally.  She states that 
she is adherent to her medications and she was advised to 
continue to follow her blood glucose levels closely at home.  
During her admission, her finger stick glucose levels were well 
controlled.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient presented as above and was admitted under Dr. 
___. She was started on broad-spectrum IV antibiotics 
and pain control. Her Coumadin was held and she was started on a 
heparin drip. Nephrology and ___ were taken on board to 
manage the patient's dialysis and diabetes respectively. Hand 
surgery was consulted who decided against surgical intervention 
given the absence of infection, cellulitis, and other clinical 
indications for immediate debridement or amputation. 
Additonally, given that the patient's primary complaint was 
diffuse, L > R hand pain, the primary areas of pain were though 
to be outside the areas of critical ischemia. Their impression 
was that amputation of the gangrenous/necrotic tissue would 
likely not effectively treat the patient's pain. 

Nest, rhematology was taken on board to help with diagnosis. 
They recommended holding midodrine (as it could be decreasing 
perfusion to the patient's fingers) and hypercoagulation workup 
which was sent. The work up has been largely non-revealing. 
Although lupus anticoagulant was positive it was thought that 
that could very well be a false positive result given the 
patient's home use of Warfarin.

Per Dr. ___ and his past experiences, the 
patient was started on empiric treatment for calciphylaxis with 
IV sodium thiosulphate. Efforts were made to get a tissue 
diagnosis by asking renal pathology to look at old slides from 
gross amputation samples but the slides were not obtainable. A 
new biopsy had the risk of non-healing so was not attempted. 

Over the course of this hospital stay the patient's symptoms 
have improved. Her pain is currently well-controled on PO meds 
and her tissue deterioration seems to have stabilized. The 
patient agrees that her current management has helped her. The 
plan for now is for her to continue receiving sodium 
thiosulphate on outpatient basis through her paritoneal 
dialysate (her primary nephrologist Dr. ___ has been 
contacted and has agreed to coordinate this). She will maintain 
close follow-up with Vascular Surgery (Drs. ___ 
who will reassess the need for surgical intervention depending 
on how the patient does on medical management.

The patient is being discharged today for home with services on 
PO antibiotics for two weeks and all her home meds except for 
midodrine and warfarin. She will follow up with Dr ___ 
___ in the next ___ weeks with a repeat testing of lupus 
anti-coagulant and with Dr ___ Rheumatology in three 
months.

___ STRESS TEST:
___ year old woman with history of old MI, CABG ___,
insulin-dependent diabetes, chronic kidney disease, 
hypertension,
presenting with shortness of breath and left shoulder 
pain/anginal
equivalent following negative serial enzymes and EKGs for 
pharmacologic
stress test with nuclear imaging. She completed 4 minutes of
dipyridamole infusion at 0.142 mg/kg/min. She had no chest, 
back, arm,
shoulder, neck, or jaw discomfort. Her baseline EKG had TWI in I 
and
aVL with diffuse TW flattening which did not change throughout 
the
study. Her rhythm was sinus with one ventricular couplet on rest 
EKG
without ectopy during study. She had an appropriate hemodynamic
response to dipyridamole infusion. At conclusion of the study,
dipyridamole was reversed with amniophylline 125 mg IV.
IMPRESSION: No anginal symptoms or ST segment changes with 
pharmacologic
stress testing. Nuclear reported separately.

___ ECHO:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left 
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is 
moderately dilated. There is mild regional left ventricular 
systolic dysfunction with inferior and inferolateral 
hypokinesis. The remaining segments contract normally (LVEF = 
40-45%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are 
normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but 
aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. 
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no 
mitral valve prolapse. Moderate to severe (3+) mitral 
regurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic 
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Mild regional left ventricular systolic function. 
Moderate to severe mitral regurgitation. Mild pulmonary 
hypertension.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of ___, 
regional LV systolic dysfunction is now more apparent.  

___ CARDIAC PERFUSION:
SUMMARY FROM THE EXERCISE LAB:
Dipyridamole was infused intravenously for 4 minutes at a dose 
of 0.142
milligram/kilogram/min. 
 
IMAGING METHOD:
Stress images were obtained with Tc-99m sestamibi. Tracer was 
administered
intravenously two minutes after the cessation of infusion of 
dipyridamole.
Stress images were obtained approximately 45 minutes following 
tracer
injection.
Resting perfusion images were obtained with Tc-99m sestamibi the 
day following
pharmacologic stress. Tracer was injected 45 minutes prior to 
obtaining the
resting images.
Image Protocol: Gated SPECT
This study was interpreted using the 17-segment myocardial 
perfusion model.
 
INTERPRETATION:
There is considerable attenuation by overlying soft tissue.
Left ventricular cavity size is moderately enlarged.
Resting and stress perfusion images reveal a moderate defect in 
the
inferolateral wall with only a small amount of reversibility.
 
Gated images reveal septal wall motion compatible with prior 
cardiac surgery.
The calculated left ventricular ejection fraction is 33%.
 
Compared with the prior exercise stress study of ___, 
there is somewhat
less reversibility in the inferolateral wall.
 
IMPRESSION:  Moderate defect in the inferolateral wall with a 
small amount of
reversibility.  Decrease ventricular function with a moderately 
enlarged
ventricle and a LVEF of 33%.  There has been little change since 
the study of
___.
 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ y/o F with extensive CAD history s/p 5 vessel CABG, ESRD on 
PD ___ DMII and HTN p/w 2 night history of SOB associated with 
back/scapular discomfort.

ACTIVE DIAGNOSES:

# Acute on Chronic Diastolic Heart Failure Dysfunction with 
Shortness of breath: Given her dependence on peritoneal 
dialysis, her history of diastolic heart failure, her shortness 
of breath when slightly more recumbent at night, significantly 
elevated JVP at >14cm on admission, significantly elevated BNP > 
16000 and above baseline, the etiology of her shortness of 
breath is most likely due to fluid and pressure overload. She 
was diuresed with IV Lasix during her hospital course and 
experienced significant improvement in her shortness of breath. 
Her weight remained relatively stable with clear lungs and lack 
of significant increase in ___ edema on presentation, however 
even a small amount of fluid overload in a patient with ESRD and 
diastolic dysfunction may result in shortness of breath, and her 
JVD suggests continued fluid or pressure overload. She was 
continued on her home diuretics metolazone and torsemide, and 
renal was consulted for increasing the volume of fluid removed 
during her PD. By the time of discharge, she had returned to her 
baseline and had no further complaints. She will follow-up with 
nephrology for further management.

# Scapular/Arm pain:
Given her extensive CAD history, report of scapular discomfort 
being her anginal equivalent, and initial troponin of 0.33, 
there was initially concern for NSTEMI/ACS. Her EKG changes were 
quite subtle and non-specific, however, with relatively stable 
___ inversions and minimal ST depression stable compared to 
baseline. Additionally, her troponins run in the 0.2s to 0.3s 
from her chronic renal insufficiency. Due to the lack of 
ischemic EKG changes, lack of significant bump of her troponins, 
as well as negative CK-MB, the etiology of both her enzymes and 
physical discomfort are likely the result of fluid overload and 
subsequent demand ischemia rather than an acute thrombotic 
event. She had been started on a heparin gtt, given aspirin, 
beta-blocker, and her other home meds, however the heparin gtt 
was stopped after further assessment and discussion with the 
cardiology team. She is currently not having any discomfort. 
Still, to rule out the possibility of CAD contributing to her 
pain, she underwent a pharmacological stress test, which showed 
stable defect in the inferolateral wall. No further 
interventions were performed. She will follow-up with her PCP as 
needed.
 
CHRONIC DIAGNOSES:

# CRI:
On nightly peritoneal dialysis. She will undergo PD tonight in 
the hospital in order to take off as much fluid as possible and 
relieve her fluid overload. She will follow-up with nephrology 
and continue her home regimen of medications for now.
 
# HTN:
Moderately hypertensive since admission. Will add 10mg 
amlodipine daily. Will continue on her other home medications.
 
# DMII:
Reported recent A1c of 6.8. Will maintain on fixed Lantus and 
SSI Humalog while in hospital.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,

It was a pleasure to take care of you during your 
hospitalization. You were admitted for shortness of breath and 
back/shoulder pain. During your stay, you were found to have 
retained too much fluid in your body and your blood pressure was 
elevated. Through medications and dialysis, we removed much of 
this excess fluid and we also controlled your blood pressure 
with new medications.

You underwent a stress test which showed a small area of 
reversible ischemia. As we discussed, the risks of giving you 
contrast for a cardiac catheterization are likely much greater 
than the potential benefits. If you have more symptoms you 
should call your cardiologist.

The nephrologists recommended changes to your peritoneal 
dialysis. One of your dwells was increased to 4.25%. The rest 
are unchanged from before. You should call your nephrologist 
first thing on ___ morning to discuss follow-up and any 
further changes. 

Please continue to weigh yourself every morning, and call your 
doctor if weight goes up more than 3 lbs. Please also continue 
to take all of your medications as prescribed.

___ ECG:
Sinus rhythm. Baseline artifact. Poor R wave progression. 
Non-specific 
inferolateral T wave flattening. Compared to the previous 
tracing of ___ artifact is more pronounced in the limb leads. 
QRS changes in leads V3-V4 could be due to lead placement. 

___ CXR:
Patient is status post median sternotomy and CABG. There are low 
inspiratory lung volumes. The heart size is moderately enlarged. 
Patchy airspace opacities are seen within the left lung base as 
well as within the right lung base medially. Findings are 
nonspecific and may represent areas of infection or atelectasis. 
A small left pleural effusion is noted. Pulmonary vascularity is 
not engorged, but the vascularity is crowded together due to low 
inspiratory lung volumes. No pneumothorax is visualized.
IMPRESSION: Patchy bibasilar airspace opacities, worse on the 
left, which
could represent atelectasis or infection. Small left effusion.

___ ECHO:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left 
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and 
regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%). The right 
ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with mild global free wall 
hypokinesis. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally 
normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation. 
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no 
mitral valve prolapse. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is 
seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. 
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is moderate 
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial 
effusion.
IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with 
preserved global and regional systolic function. Mild global 
right ventricular systolic dysfunction. Moderate mitral and 
tricuspid regurgitation. Moderate pulmonary hypertension.
  Compared with the report of the prior study (images 
unavailable for review) of ___, right ventricle now appears 
mildly hypokinetic and pulmonary pressures are higher. There may 
be more mitral and tricuspid regurgitation.  

___ ECHO WITH BUBBLES:
The left atrium is normal in size. No atrial septal defect or 
patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline 
contrast with maneuvers. The right atrial pressure is 
indeterminate. There is mild symmetric left ventricular 
hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic 
function (LVEF>55%). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an 
increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). The 
right ventricular cavity is moderately dilated with mild global 
free wall hypokinesis. There is abnormal septal motion/position 
consistent with right ventricular pressure/volume overload. The 
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic 
stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The 
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral 
valve prolapse. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The 
tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate to 
severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is moderate 
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial 
effusion.
 Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of ___, 
the severity of tricuspid regurgitation has increased.  

___ CXR:
PA and lateral chest compared to ___ and ___. 
Moderate cardiomegaly and pulmonary vascular congestion are 
longstanding. Aeration in the left lower lobe has improved since 
___. Whether this is decreased edema or atelectasis is 
radiographically indeterminate, but edema if any is minimal 
currently. Small bilateral pleural effusion, unchanged. No 
pneumothorax.
 
Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ is a ___ y/o female with a history of poorly 
controlled DM2, CAD s/p 5 vessel CABG, who presents with 3 weeks 
of gradually worsening SOB, intermittent back pain/CP at night, 
and desaturation consistent with diastolic congestive heart 
failure exacerbation.

1. Acute on Chronic Diastolic Congestive Heart Failure: Ms. 
___ presented with shortness of breath and weight gain. Her 
previous echo in ___ and her echo during this admission 
showed a preserved EF of 55%. She was on 40 mg of Lasix twice a 
day which was not adequate. She denied any recent chest pain, 
fevers, chills, or large salt intake. She was treated with a 
Lasix drip throughout the admission with a goal of ___ liters 
negative per day. Metolazone 10 mg twice a day was added to her 
regimen. During the hospitalization, Ms. ___ weight 
decreased by more than 30 kg. Her shortness of breath improved.

2. Coronary Artery Disease: Ms. ___ has a significant 
history of CAD and has had multiple interventions in the past. 
She was chest pain free throughout her admission. We continued 
aspirin 81 mg daily, atorvastatin 80 mg daily, isosorbide 
mononitrate 60 mg daily, and metoprolol 100 mg daily.

3. Oxygen Requirement: On admission, Ms ___ had a new oxygen 
requirement. On arrival, her O2 sat was 78% on RA, which 
improved to 91% on 4 L/min. As she was diuresed, her oxygen 
requirement decreased and on discharge, O2 sat was 92% on 2 
L/min. At discharge, a chest x-ray was repeated, which did not 
show pneumonia to explain the oxygen requirement. The patient 
had an echo with bubbles to evaluate for shunting, which did not 
reveal a right-to-left shunt. Ms. ___ will have home oxygen. 
She has follow-up in pulmonary clinic.

4. Chronic kidney disease: Ms. ___ creatinine was slightly 
increased above baseline, which is likely multifactorial, 
secondary to both poor forward flow and diabetic nephropathy. 
Her ___ was held during her hospitalization and re-started prior 
to discharge. She also had elevated phosphorus, but a calcium 
phosphorus product less than 50. She has an elevated PTH. This 
abnormality may be consistent with secondary hyperparathyroidism 
due to renal failure. The patient has follow-up with renal as an 
outpatient.

5. Hypertension: She was noted to be very hypertensive when she 
arrived on the floor. She denied having any headaches or changes 
in her vision. She was initially treated with hydralazine 25 mg 
PO q6, metoprolol and amlodipine. Her blood pressure was better 
controlled. At discharge, the hydralazine was stopped and ___ 
restarted.

6. Type 2 Diabetes: She has poorly controlled diabetes with an 
A1c of 10.9 in ___. She is on insulin at home and was continued 
on  her home regimen.

You were admitted to the hospital with a congestive heart 
failure exacerbation.   You were given medication to remove 
fluid from your body and your symptoms improved.  Since you were 
admitted, you have required oxygen to maintain adequate oxygen 
in your blood.  We are sending you home with oxygen.  You will 
also have follow-up with the pulmonary doctors.  

You need to have your labs checked on ___.  Please have these 
checked and sent to your primary care doctor to have your 
electrolytes evaluated. We also found that you have some injury 
to your kidneys.  This is likely causing your phosphorus to be 
elevated.  We are going to have you follow-up with the kidney 
doctors as ___ outpatient.  

You were started on a diuretic called torsemide to help keep the 
fluid from reaccumulating.  Torsemide is a stronger diuretic 
than furosemide.  

The following changes were made to your medications:
1. Added torsemide 100 mg PO daily
2. Added Metolazone 10 mg daily (please take this medication 
prior to the torsemide)
3. Stopped Furosemide 40 mg PO BID
4. Increased your dose of Isosorbide Mononitrate to 120 mg daily 
from 60 mg daily
5. Increased your dose of Metoprolol Succinate XL to 150 mg 
daily from 100 mg daily
6. Added Reglan 10 mg prior to meals and bedtime.  Please take 
this medication for gastroparesis.  Take 30 minutes prior to

Brief Hospital Course:
HOSPITAL COURSE
___ F PMHx poorly controlled DM, CAD, CHF w recent 100lb 
diuresis, a/w 14 lb wt gain in setting of decreased diuresis 
regimen, c/w poor diuresis, no signs of underlying ACS, now 
being diuresed.   
.  
ACTIVE
# dCHF exacerbation: Although the etiology of her chronic dCHF 
remains unknown (its severity far exceeds the extent of her risk 
factors), her acute 14 lb wt gain in the setting of recent 
discontinuation of her metolazone and decreased dosing of her 
torsemide, is believed to be the primary cause of this 
readmission.  Patient was aggressively diuresed, then started on 
a regimen of torsemide, which was uptitrated.  Metolazone was 
not restarted out of concern for overdiuresis in the outpatient 
setting.  At discharge, patient's weight was 91.9. 
.  
# HTN: On admission, patient's HTN was poorly controlled w SBP 
in 140s-150s.  Her metoprolol was changed to carvedilol for 
better afterload control. Carvedilol was then discontinued due 
to hypotension and she was started on metoprolol tartarate and 
will go home on her usual dose of metoprolol.  
.
# Anemia: Patient was admitted w Hct of 28.8, normocytic, with a 
prior colonscopy and EGD both neg, guaiac neg.  It dropped to 23 
and, given her known CAD, she was transfused 1 unit pRBCs.  
Patient remained stable for the remained of this admission.
.
#CKD: Cr elevated to 2.0 (baseline 1.6-1.8), which was thought 
to most likely be ___ to poor forward flow. She will follow up 
this issue with Neprhology as an outpatient next week. 

INACTIVE
# CORONARIES: Patient was continued on home ASA, isosorbide 
mononitrate was uptitrated.  
# DMII: Patient was continued on home glargine 22u QHS and 
sliding scale humalog.

suspected neuropathic changes and widespread dense arterial 
calcifications.  Overall, there are no radiographic findings 
suggestive of superimposed osteomyelitis, but MR could be 
potentially useful to evaluate further if clinically indicated. 

HAND X-RAY ___
IMPRESSION: Overall similar appearance of the foot with 
suspected neuropathic changes and widespread dense arterial 
calcifications.  Overall, there are no radiographic findings 
suggestive of superimposed osteomyelitis, but MR could be 
potentially useful to evaluate further if clinically indicated. 

CXR___
IMPRESSION: Right internal jugular central venous catheter tip 
terminates within the proximal right atrium.  Persistent mild 
pulmonary edema, small left pleural effusion, and retrocardiac 
opacity, possibly reflecting atelectasis, infection or 
aspiration. 

ECHO ___
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left 
ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular 
systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50%) secondary to focal 
akinesis/hypokinesis of the posterior wall. Due to the 
technically suboptimal nature of this study, other focal wall 
motion abnormalities cannot be excluded. There are three aortic 
valve leaflets. The aortic valve leaflets are moderately 
thickened. There is a minimally increased gradient consistent 
with minimal aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is 
seen. The mitral valve leaflets are moderately thickened. There 
is a probable vegetation (approximately 1 cm) on the anterior 
mitral valve leaflet (atrial side). There is severe mitral 
annular calcification. There is moderate thickening of the 
mitral valve chordae. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is 
seen. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is 
moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no 
pericardial effusion. 
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of ___, a 
probable mitral valve vegetation is now seen.

ACTIVE ISSUES

# Hypotension:  

In ED, SBPs were down to ___ and patient met ___ SIRS (tachypnea 
and leukocytosis). In the ED pt was thought to be hypotensive 
___ to septic shock vs cardiogenic shock (troponins elevated, 
discussed further below) and as such she was given 3L fluid and 
started on levophed. Pt was seen by vascular surgery in the ED 
who felt that her gangrenous fingers or her LLE lesion could be 
possible sources of infection, but did not feel that surgery was 
necessary at the time. Pt was started on broad spectrum abx and 
sent to the CCU. 

On arrival to the CCU, it was noted that the pts lactate was not 
elevated and patient was A+Ox3, which indicated adequate 
perfusion. Upon further chart review, it was noted that the 
patient is chronically hypotensive, with SBPs in the 80-90s in 
the afternoon and 70-60s in the AM. She was started on midodrine 
in ___ as she was symptomatic (dizzy, syncope). However, 
this was d/c'd during her last hospitalization d/t gangrene of 
her fingers. Once stable in the CCU, pt was weaned off of 
levophed and pt tolerated with SBPs in 80-90s without any 
pressure support or fluid boluses. She was transfered to the 
medicine.  

On the Medicine floor she was monitored on telemetry. She 
triggered for SBPs in the ___ and received fluid.  Her SBP 
improved to the 120-130s range with fluid and increased PO 
intake.  However her BP would drop to the 70-80s immediately 
after peritoneal dialysis and she required fluid boluses to 
maintain her pressure, and titration of her PD orders by the 
renal service. By discharge her BP had stabilized. Discharge BP 
118/50.   

# LLE Osteomyelitis w/ Leukocytosis: Upon admission, WBC 
elevated to 24.4. Ucx, stool cx, peritoneal cx, bcx, and CXR 
negative for sources of infection. Pt has 2 cm round lesion on 
the LLE that was the likely source. Pt stated that it had been 
oozing more PTA, but not painful, as she has chronic peripheral 
neuropathy. Foot x-ray done in the ED did not show osteo, but 
ESR was 140 and values > 100 indicate possibility of 
osteomyelitis. Podiatry was consulted and bone bx was performed 
to formally determine if pt has osteomyelitis and to tailor abx 
appropriately. She was empirically started on 
vanc/cefepime/flagyl and subsequently switched to vanc/zosyn for 
coverage of MRSA, gram negative, and possible pseudomonal 
infection.  Wound cultures grew psudomonas and serratia.  
Vancomycin and zosyn were continued.  Coverage was planned to be 
narrowed to zosyn alone, but given new mitral valve vegitation, 
it was continued untl ID consult obtained. Pts minocyline was 
stopped. Abx changed to Ceftazidine and Metronidazole to be 
continued for 6 weeks (start date ___ end date ___. 
Podiatry and physical therapy were consulted prior to discharge. 
Left leg cannot bear weight until LLE ulcer has been determined 
healed by outpatient podiatrist. ___ recommended discharge to 
rehabilitation facility for reconditioning.

# NSTEMI: In ED, troponin 2.23, CK-MB 18, and EKG with new 
ST-depressions in lateral leads (notable on EKG from clinic 3 
days prior). It is possible that troponemia was due to ___, 
however patient has chronic troponemia, and her values today are 
5x her normal level and EKG with new changes. Her TIMI score was 
5. Medical management was determined optimal given her extensive 
revascularization history and multiple CABG. On admission pt was 
asymptomatic wo CP, SOB, or nausea/diaphoresis. Pt was continued 
on her home ASA 325 mg, started on heparin gtt, and CE were 
trended. At the time of transfer CE were decreased with troponin 
at 1.95. Heparin gtt was stopped after 24 hours prior to 
transfer to floor, as pt was stable with no new ACS symptoms. 
Normal post NSTEMI beta blocker held due to hypotension. NSTEMI 
considered resolved upon discharge.

# CHF/Mitral valve vegitation: Patient with history of CHF w/ 
preserved EF (HFPEF). Echo in ___ showed EF 50% and 
basal-inferior/infero-lateral hypokinesis. Patient presents 
today with NSTEMI and BNP 37,000 with mild pulmonary edema on 
chest xray. BNP 2 weeks ago 17,000. ECHO was done on ___ and 
revealed left ventricular systolic function atw normal (LVEF 
50%) secondary to focal akinesis/hypokinesis of the posterior 
wall as well as a new mitral valve vegitation. Pt was 
transferred to floor service prior to receipt of these results. 
Dr. ___ primary cardiologist was consulted and 
after reviewing previous echos it could not be definitively 
determined if this vegitation was present previously. It was 
decided that the patient be treated assuming this is a new 
endocarditis lesion. Patient received a TTE which supported 
presensce of vegetation on mitral valve, but patient delined TEE 
which would have provided a clearer view. Antibiotic therapy for 
LLE ulcer will be continued to cover any possible infected 
vegetation though suspicion is very low.
 
# ESRD on peritoneal dialysis: Pt dialyzed in the ED. Renal was 
consulted and recommended renally dosing abx, and gave rec for 
continuing PD, which was followed while pt was in the CCU and 
after transfer to the floor. Home medications were continued, 
including lanthanum, nephrocaps, and bowel regimen with 
lactulose + senna, colace, bisacodyl PRN. Her potassium was low 
___ to cycling of peritoneal dialysis fluid and renal recommend 
removing the potassium restriction on her diet.  If she becomes 
hypokalemic she may need potassium supplementation in her PD 
fluid.  Her lactulose was discontinued secondary to diarrhea.

# Diarrhea: Patient developed diarrhea on medicine floor. C. 
dificile toxin assay from ___ was negative. Diarrhea determined 
to be non-infectious. Reglan reduced to TID and lactulose held. 
On ___ she was started on Loperamide and this was continued as 
needed on discharge for diarrhea.

# Hypercoagulability:  There was concern that an alternative 
explanation for her distal necrosis maybe hypercoagulability 
instead of calciphylaxis.  She has received a thorough workup 
including Lupus ProtCFn ProtSFn ACA IgG ACA IgM, all of which 
were within normal limits.  Note that Lupus Anticoagulant was 
positive when she was on coumadin but negative after 
discontinuation.  In the past she has had normal SPEP and UPEP 
as well.  It may be warranted to pursue further workup of of 
hypercoagulability with Factor V Leiden and a Prothrombin 
Mutation Analysis, but this is of low yield and unlikely to 
explain her clotting.    

CHRONIC ISSUES

Discharge Instructions:
Dear ___, 
___  was a pleasure caring for you during your recent admission 
to ___,  You were admitted  for 
fatigue and low blood blood pressure.  You were found to have an 
infection of your left foot that spread to your bone.  We 
treated you with fluids and medications to maintain your blood 
pressure and treated you with antibiotics to control the 
infection.  Your heart was also injured by the low blood 
pressure and we performed tests to look at your heart function.  
While your heart function was unchanged from previous 
hospitalizations there was a concerning lesion found on one of 
your heart valves which could be a sign of an infection.  We 
discussed this infection with our cardiologists and infectious 
disease specialists who agree that you should be treated with 6 
weeks of IV antibiotics. Our vascular surgeons met with you to 
discuss further amputations of your fingers.  You were not 
interested in further amputation at this time, but were 
encouraged to follow up with vascular surgery if the gangrene on 
your fingers spreads or you desire amputation.   You must 
continue to take your IV antibiotics for the next 6 weeks.

THere was also consern that your blood may be more likely to 
clot than normal.  We performed tests to examine this further 
some of the results of these tests are pending.  You should 
follow up with your primary care doctor to obtain the results of 
these tests and determine if further testing is indicated.  
Additionally you should follow up with with all of your doctors 
___ below.

To Do:
1) Do not bear weight on your left leg until a podiatrist says 
that the wound has healed and is ready.
2) Please resume the diet recommended by your endocrinologist 
and primary care doctor. You do not need to continue your low 
phosphate diet.
3) Please follow-up with your outpatient providers. Your 
appointments are listed below.

Brief Hospital Course:
Patient was admitted to the vascular surgery service on ___ 
with pain and discoloration of her right ___ digit.  A CTA was 
obtained which was significant for:

Patent flow from the aortic arch, right brachiocephalic artery 
to the 
radial and ulnar arteries at the level of the wrist, without 
occlusion or high 
grade stenosis. Multifocal moderate to severe narrowing of the 
distal ulnar 
artery.  Assessment of patency of the arteries distal to the 
wrist within the hand 
is markedly limited due to extensive atherosclerotic 
calcifications and the 
small caliber of these arteries.

Due to concern for arterial embolic disease, she was started on 
a heparin drip.  Because she had a history of GI bleed ___ 
dieulafoy's lesion, a GI consult was obtained to determine risk 
of anticoagulation.  On ___, she was started on coumadin, 5 mg, 
and also received 5 mg on ___. She was started on high dose 
omeprazole, and on ___, GI performed an EGD.  They did not see 
any bleeding or nidus for bleed, however, they were unable to 
perform a full evaluation ___ food in the stomach.  GI 
determined that the area of her previous bleed appeared stable, 
and she would be safe to anticoagulate with a goal INR of 
2.0-3.0 while on omeprazole 40 mg daily.  She was deemed 
appropriate for discharge on ___, and will follow up with Dr. 
___ INR and coumadin dosing.

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted to the vascular surgery service with right 
hand pain and color changes in your fingers concerning for 
ischemia.  A CT angiogram showed extensive atherosclerotic 
calcifications in your hand distal to the wrist.  You were 
anticoagulated with a heparin drip, and transitioned to oral 
coumadin (warfarin) to take as an outpatient.  Your INR 
(coumadin level) is now therapeutic, between 2.0-3.0 and you are 
ready to return home.  You will be on coumadin for the next 
three months to treat a likely arterial embolic event.  You 
should follow your INR very closely with your primary doctor, 
and adjust the coumadin dose as needed.  Coumadin puts you at an 
increased risk of bleeding, so please be vigilant in monitoring 
these INR leves as well as any signs/symptoms of bleeding.

Weigh yourself every morning, call MD if weight goes up more 
than 3 lbs.

Blood Cultures ___ Negative

EKG ___:
Sinus bradycardia. Consider left ventricular hypertrophy, 
although is non-diagnostic. Lateral lead ST-T wave changes with 
borderline prolonged QTc interval may be due to left ventricular 
hypertrophy or possible myocardial ischemia. Clinical 
correlation is suggested. Since the previous tracing of ___ 
there is probably no significant change.

CXR ___:
Patient is status post CABG. Sternotomy sutures are midline and 
intact. Surgical clips noted overlying the left heart border. 
Mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable. The left heart 
border is obscured due to a moderate left pleural effusion and 
atelectasis, underlying consolidation not excluded. There is a 
small right pleural effusion. IMPRESSION: Moderate left and 
small right pleural effusion with overlying 
atelectasis;underlying consolidation can not be excluded.

TTE ___:
The left atrium is dilated. There is mild symmetric left 
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and 
regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%). Overall left 
ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). The right 
ventricular cavity is dilated with depressed free wall 
contractility. The diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending 
and arch levels are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are 
mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. The mitral 
valve leaflets are moderately thickened. There is a probable 
vegetation on the mitral valve. Moderate (2+) mitral 
regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity 
of mitral regurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated.] 
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate to 
severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is moderate 
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. [In the setting of at 
least moderate to severe tricuspid regurgitation, the estimated 
pulmonary artery systolic pressure may be underestimated due to 
a very high right atrial pressure.] There is no pericardial 
effusion. 
IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with 
preserved global left ventricular systolic function. The basal 
inferolateral wall may be mildly hypokinetic. There is a small 
echodensity seen on the posterioro leaflet of the mitral valve 
in the parasternal long axis view. This could be due to artifact 
or to prolapse of part of the leaflet however a vegetation 
cannot be excluded. Moderate mitral regurgitation is seen. The 
RV is not well seen but is probably dilated/depressed with 
moderate to severe tricuspid regurgitation and moderate to 
severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. Compared with the 
report of the prior study (images unavailable for review) of 
___, the degree of pulmonary hypertension has increased. 
The echodensity was probably not present on the prior although 
image quality precludes certatinty about this finding.

 
Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ is a ___ diabetic female with severe coronary 
disease, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diastolic heart failure, 
and previous osteomyelitis of the left ankle who presented in 
acute diastolic heart failure, felt to be triggered possibly by 
starting erythropoetin injections, and who was diuresed to her 
dry weight.

ACTIVE ISSUES:
1. ACUTE ON CHRONIC DIASTOLIC HEART FAILURE:  She noted 
worsening exertional dyspnea with an increased home oxygen 
requirement, lower extremity swelling, and a ___ weight gain 
over the past few months that has been resistant to an increased 
home torsemide dose.  Her BNP was elevated to over 7000 and her 
CXR showed bilateral pleural effusions and edema consistent with 
acute heart failure.  She was diuresed agressively with a 
furosemide gtt and metolazone with good effect.  A repeat 
echocardiogram demonstrated a preserved ejection fraction of 
55%.  Her slowly rising creatinine required intermittent easing 
of her diuretic regimen, though she was eventually returned to 
her dry weight of about 213lb. The precipitant of this 
exacerbation was felt to be secondary to starting erythropoetin 
in the preceding months for her chronic anemia, which is 
associated with increased hospitalizations for heart failure.  
She otherwise denied salt indiscretions and was compliant with 
her medications.  After discussion with her nephrologist, 
erythropoetin was discontinued, and she subsequently restarted 
her home oral diuretics with torsemide 100mg daily and 
metolazone 2.5mg QMWF.  She has close followup with her PCP and 
cardiologist to help titrate her diuretics.

2. ACUTE ON CHRONIC KIDNEY DISEASE: She has likely diabetic and 
hypertensive nephropathy and presented in stage III-VI CKD with 
a Cr of 2.4.  With diuresis, her creatinine slowly increased to 
a discharge level of 3.5, though the BUN remained stable from 
65-70.  Her creatinine failed to improve with easing of her 
diuretics, and so her home regimen was not intensified on 
discharge.  She will have electrolytes checked a few days 
following discharge.

3. CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE:  She has a history of severe 
coronary artery disease, and presented with an episode of 
substernal chest pain accompanying her dyspnea.  Her EKG was 
largely unchanged from prior.  Her cardiac troponin was 
initially less than assay, but then rose to 0.16 without further 
elevation, likely due to renal disease.  She had no further 
chest pain and no new wall motion abnormalities were seen on 
TTE, so ongoing ischemia was not suspected.

4. MITRAL VALVE VEGETATION: An echodensity was seen on the 
mitral valve on her ___ TTE.  Given her history of 
osteomyelitis, endocarditis was suspected and she was started 
empirically on vancomycin. ID was consulted.  Though her 
inflammatory markers were elevated, she had no fevers or 
peripheral sequelae of endocarditis, and so the suspicion of 
endocarditis fell.  Antibiotics were stopped and she remained 
afebrile and asymptomatic.  Blood cultures were negative.  A TEE 
was not pursued.  On further review of echo images, it is 
unclear if this density is new.

5. HYPERTENSION:  She presented with systolic blood pressures to 
the 160s-170s.  Her metoprolol was switched to labetalol for 
enhanced blood pressure control, which was uptitrated to maximal 
400mg BID.  Her pressures improved to about 140s systolic, 
requiring intermittent hydralazine.  Her labetalol was decreased 
to 200mg BID on discharge due to orthostasis.  She continued 
amlodipine and losartan.  She is at high risk for sleep apnea 
which also may be contributing to her hypertension, and she 
would benefit from outpatient testing.

6. ORTHOSTATIC HYPOTENSION:  She had asymptomatic orthostatic 
hypotension for the last few days of admission, which was felt 
to be related to aggressive diuresis, aggressive beta blockade, 
or autonomic dysfunction from diabetes.  Her labetalol was 
decreased to 200mg BID.  She was ambulating around the floor 
without difficulty, and was discharged with close followup.

INACTIVE ISSUES:
7. DIABETES MELLITUS, TYPE II:  She was continued on her home

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,

You were admitted to ___ to treat an exacerbation of your 
congestive heart failure that we suspect was due to the 
medication Procrit that you started a few months ago.  We were 
able to slowly remove fluid from your lungs and legs with 
intravenous diuretics with resolution of your symptoms. We will 
be sending you home on the same diuretic regimen of torsemide 
100mg daily and metolazone 2.5mg every MWF.  Your procrit was 
stopped.

An echocardiogram showed a possible growth on one of your heart 
valves.  Consultation with the infectious disease doctors was 
___, and they did not think this was an infection called 
endocarditis.

It is extremely important that you weigh yourself every day.  
Please call your doctor if your weight goes up more than 3lb.  
Also, please avoid salty foods as this will help prevent further 
exacerbations and long hospital stays!

The following changes were made to your medications:
1. STOP PROCRIT
2. STOP metoprolol succinate
3. START LABETALOL 400mg twice a day to help control your blood 
pressure

It was a pleasure taking care of you, ___

LUE U/S ___ for LUE swelling: no DVT
 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ admitted on ___ due to worsening right long finger 
gangrene.  She empirically was started on broad spectrum 
antibiotics.  She was also started on a heparin drip.  Her 
hospital course was realtively benign.  On ___ she developed 
LUE swelling, but an U/S showed no DVT.  As such, warm 
compresses and limb elevation were applied to the affected area 
with good effect.

By ___, it was clear that the demarcation had completed.  As 
such, we amputated her right long finger all the way to the 
metacarpophalangeal joint space.  She tolerated the conscious 
sedation and procedure well, and was shortly thereafter brought 
to the PACU and subsequently to the floor.  Her diet was 
advanced, and she had good pain control.  We resumed her heparin 
drip and commenced warfarin therapy.  She was not a candidate 
for enoxaparin, and so we had to keep her here until she became 
therapeutic on warfarin.  Once she achieved her goal INR, she 
was discharged home in stable condition with instructions to 
follow up with Dr. ___ as an outpatient in 2 weeks time.

coronary artery disease and CABG surgery at age ___, heart 
failure with preserved LVEF on home oxygen at 2L, DM, CKD, and 
chronic anemia who presents with worsening shortness of breath 
and left-sided chest pain.  
  
# Demand Ischemia:  Chest pain likely represented demand 
ischemia in the setting of anemia and volume overload. Chest 
pain quickly dissipated and her breathing improved once pt was 
given 3 units of pRBCs for her anemia and diuresed (-7 L over 
the hopsitalization) with a lasix drip.  Troponins were mildly 
elevated above baseline but in the setting of worsened renal 
function and anemia, this bump was most likely ___ demand 
ischemia and not ACS. We continue her home home meds of ASA, 
atorvastatin and labetalol.
  
# Acute on Chronic Diastolic Heart Failure: Pt was about 15 
pounds above dry weight on admission.  She diuresed well with a 
lasix gtt and home metolazone dose and was down 5.2 kg on 
dischaerge.  We did switch her back to her home diuretic regimen 
of torsemide 100 mg po and metolazone 2.5 mg daily the day 
before discharge.   

# Hypertension:  Pt remained hypertension during much of the 
admission with SBP's as high as the 170's.  We did incrwased her 
home labetalol dose to 400 mg bid with minimal improvement.  A 
main barrier to further BP control was that she remained 
orthostatic (80's/50's when standing) although was aymptomatic.  
We believe that the orthostasis may be related to her 
longstanding diabetes, as well as possible over-diuresis.  We 
sent the pt home on her normal blood pressure regimen, with 
instructions on managing her orthostasis.
  
# Anemia: Hct on admission was 19.  Pt was given 3 untis of 
pRBC's and had an appropriate hct increase.  She reamined stable 
in the ___ range for the rest of the hospitalization.  She has 
required multiple transfusions in the past. Prior hematology 
workup suggested it was secondary to AOCD/renal disease.  Iron 
studies on this admission also suggest that it is secondary to 
AOCD. She was previously on Procrit but this was stopped due to 
concern for exacerbating heart failure.  I spoke with Dr. ___ 
___ possibly restarting procit with a modest goal of ___ in 
an attempt to prevent further episodes of demand ischemia. 
  
# Acute on Chronic Kidney Disease: Cr remained in 3.6 -3.9 range 
during admission.  FEurea of 31 which was consistent with 
pre-renal etiology, likely from poor perfusion to kidneys from 
worsening CHF. She also has nephrotic range proteinuria which 
was also present in ___. This is most likely diabetic 
nephrosclerosis.  She will follow-up with her nephrologist Dr. 
___.
  
# Diabetes mellitus: Blood glucose well-controlled on Lantus 
from 20 qHS and humalog sliding scale.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear ___,

___ was a pleasure taking care of you during your hospitalization 
here at ___.  You were admitted 
with worsening shortness of breath and chest pain.  You were 
also found to have severe anemia and around 15 extra pounds of 
fluid that had accumulated on your body.  We beleive that the 
extra fluid as well as your anemia likely caused you to have 
chest pain and a small amount of damage to your heart muscle.
   We gave you three units of blood to help correct the enemia 
and put you on a lasix drip that was successful in removing a 
large amount of fluid from your body.
   Your chest pain and shortness improved dramatically with the 
above therapy. Your blood pressure goes down significantly when 
you stand up, but you do not seem to have any symptomatic 
change. Please be careful when standing up, and give yourself 
time to equilibrate before walking. If you are dizzy while 
standing, please talk to your cardiologist about stopping one of 
your blood pressure medications.

You are now safe for discharge home.

MEDICATION CHANGES:
- Because of your worsening kidney function, please take 
gabapentin once a day instead of three times a day.
- Because of your worsening kidney function, you may be more 
susceptible to sedation from your Dilaudid (hydromorphone). 
Please be cautious when taking Dilaudid for pain in your foot.

Weigh yourself every morning, call MD if weight goes up more 
than 3 lbs.

___ Echo: The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left 
ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular 
cavity is mildly dilated. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a 
focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Overall 
left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right 
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The 
aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good 
leaflet excursion. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The 
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral 
regurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic 
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion. 
.
No vegetation seen but cannot definitively exclude. 
.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of ___, 
there is no definite change.  
 
Brief Hospital Course:
The patient is a ___ year-old female with PMH significant for CAD 
s/p CABG in ___ (EF=50-55%), IDDM, hyperlipidemia, and HTN who 
presents with new DOE and persistent low-grade fever.  
.  
#. CAD - The patient ruled out for acute MI with negative 
cardiac enzymes x 3 and no evidence of ischemia on EKG. The 
patient had an echo inhouse to evaluate for presence of new wall 
motion abnormality as new CHF could have been secondary to 
recent MI; however, wall motion overall appeared unchanged from 
prior. (Note: new ___ could not be excluded on echo due to poor 
windows.) The patient was continued on medical management with 
aspirin, plavix, BB, statin, and imdur with no acute issues.  
.  
#. Pump/ acute diastolic CHF - The patient had no evidence of 
CHF at recent outpatient cardiology visit ___, but now presented 
with clinical symptoms and radiographic evidence of CHF. BNP was 
elevated at 2200 (no baseline for comparison). Echo was 
consistent with mild diastolic failure with LVEF 60%. Etiology 
of CHF was unclear, but high output failure was considered in 
the setting of fever and anemia. Silient ischemia was felt to be 
unlikely as there were no new focal WMA on echo (however, this 
could not be fully excluded due to poor windows). The patient 
responded well to diuresis with IV lasix with resolution of SOB 
and ___ edema. Home dose of lasix 40mg po daily was started prior 
to discharge. She was continued on ACE, BB, and CCB for 
afterload reduction. The patient was discharged on mild 2000cc 
fluid restriction, and was advised to ___ with her 
cardiologist for further management.
.  
#. Rhythm - NSR on telemetry. The patient was continued on home 
BB. 
.  
#. HTN - The patient was continued on home regimen of ACE, BB, 
norvasc, and lasix. Lisinopril dose was decreased from 30mg 
daily to 20mg daily for hyperkalemia. 
.  
#. Hyperlipidemia - Lipid panel showed: Tchol-116, ___, 
HDL-20, LDL-59 in ___. 
The patient was continued on home regimen of zetia and 
atorvastatin.  
.  
# Fevers - The patient reported history of low-grade fevers to 
100.8 for approx 2 weeks. There was no localizing signs or 
symptoms of infection on exam, except known UTI that was being 
treated with an extended course of bactrim. Etiology of fever 
was felt to be secondary to inadequately treated UTI ___ 
coag neg staph here, outpatient UCx on ___ with 8K gram pos 
colonies with no speciation or sensitivities at that time) 
versus drug fever in response to Bactrim. Admission CBC was 
without leukocytosis or left shift, CXR was without obvious 
infiltrate. BCx were negative to date during admission. R foot 
films were negative for osteomyelitis (small superficial 
nonhealing ulcer on R great toe and elevated ESR/ CRP earlier in 
___. Other infectious sources include possible endocarditis 
given new murmur and elevated ESR and CRP on last admission; 
however, the patient did not consent to TEE (TTE negative for 
vegitation, but poor windows). ROS was negative for 
rheumatologic disease. The patient was switched to ciprofloxacin 
to complete a 7 day course for presumptive UTI - temperature 
curve decreased to < 100 after this switch. Speciation and 
sensitivities on urine culture were pending at the time of 
discharge, and may be followed up by the patient's PCP. The 
patient was advised to monitor fever curve after discharge.
.  
#. IDDM - The patient has a history of poorly controlled IDDM 
with recent HbA1c of 14.5% in ___. She was previously followed 
by ___, though not recently. The patient was seen by the 
___ inhouse. Insulin regimen was uptitrated with good 
effect - BS in the 100s prior to discharge. She was set-up for 
___ in ___ for further care. Neurontin was continued 
for neuropathic pain.  
.  
#. Anemia - The patient had evidence of a microcytic anemia with 
hct ___ during admission. Fe studies were consistent with iron 
deficiency, but likely has an element of AOCD given elevated ESR 
and CRP. Retic slightly elevated at 1.9%. There was no evidence 
of bleeding or hemolysis (guaiac negative on rectal exam in ED, 
no recent procedures, hemolysis labs negative). There is no 
family history of colon cancer, and the patient has not had a 
prior colonoscopy. The patient is still menstruating. She was 
started on iron supplementation inhouse and advised to have hct 
monitored as an outpatient. If ESR is still elevated and anemia 
persists in ___ weeks, rheumatologic evaluation may be 
considered. (Rheumatologic ROS negative as inpatient). 
Outpatient colonoscopy may be considered in the future.
.  
#. Hyperkalemia - The patient presented with peristent 
hyperkalemia (K 5.3-5.6) inhouse despite lasix and kayexalate. 
There were no EKG changes. Lisinopril dose was decreased to 20mg 
daily. Home lasix was continued. KCl supplementation was 
discontinued. 
.
#. The patient was discharged in good condition on ___ with 
cardiology and PCP ___ in place.

IMAGING:
 
___ L foot x-ray:  
1. Findings concerning for possible osteomyelitis superimposed 
on an evolving Charcot's joint, although no radiographic 
evidence of ulcer. Extensive osseous destruction and lucencies 
involving the medial and mid cuneiforms, second and third 
metatarsal bases, and navicular bone. While findings could in 
part relate to an evolving Charcot's joint, new since ___, 
they are in conjunction with overlying soft tissue gas and 
swelling, making superimposed osteomyelitis of concern. 
Recommend clinical correlation for soft tissue  
defect/ulcer and further evaluation with nuclear medicine study 
or MRI.  
2. Gas noted in anterior ankle. Given known leg cellulitis, 
proximal extent not evaluated.  

___ MRI/MRA Head: No signs of infarct.  

___ CXR:  
Comparison is made to the prior study from ___. The heart 
is enlarged. There is atelectasis at the left lung base with a 
small left pleural effusion. This is status post median 
sternotomy. Right lung is relatively clear.  

___ Renal ultrasound: No evidence of hydronephrosis.  

___ TTE:  
The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall 
thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic function are 
normal (LVEF >55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall 
motion are normal. The diameters of aorta at the sinus, 
ascending and arch levels are normal. The aortic valve leaflets 
(3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and 
no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly 
thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is mild 
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial 
effusion.  
IMPRESSION: Mild tricuspid regurgitation. Normal biventricular 
cavity sizes with preserved global and regional biventricular 
systolic function. Mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.  

Compared with the prior report (images unavailable for review) 
of ___, the findings are similar.  

 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ year old F with hx of CAD, DM, HTN presented with left lower 
extremity pain and erythma secondary to acute charcot foot with 
overlying cellulitis. On floor patient developed hypotension and 
oliguria despite 6 L NS IVF due to MSSA sepsis.  She improved 
and was sent out to the floor where she continued treatment for 
MSSA bacteremia and L Charcot foot, cellulitis and osteomyelitis 
until she developed a GI bleed from a Dieulafoy lesion.  After 
endoscopy with endoclips and cautery, she was stabilized and 
sent back to the floor for continued management.  After 
returning to the floor her course was then complicated by 
another debridement and then renal failure due to AIN from her 
nafcillin.  
.
# Left Charcot foot with osteomyelitis and overlying cellulitis: 
Patient presented with left lower extremity pain and erythema.  
She was seen by podiatry and vascular surgery who felt this was 
consistent with an acute Charcot foot.  She then became 
hypotensive and oliguric requiring MICU admission where she was 
found to be septic with MSSA. Her foot was the presumed source 
and a CT of her leg showed several gas pockets within the foot 
and ankle. Patient underwent I&D on ___ with swab and tissue 
cultures showing MSSA.  Infectious disease was consulted and 
recommended at least a 6 week course of nafcillin, however after 
her final debridement cultures were growing enterobacter and 
klebsiella, and she developed AIN her antibiotic regimen was 
changed to ciprofloxacin and vancomycin.  She will need 6 weeks 
of vancomycin from the date of her last debridement on ___, 
and ___ weeks of ciprofloxacin from ___, this course will be 
outlined during her ID appointment in ___.  She will need 
weekly labs that include: cbc, diff, bun, cr, lfts, esr, 
crp,vancomycin trough and  have ALL THE LABS faxed to the 
infectious disease R.Ns. at ___.  
.
# Dieulafoy lesion: She had a hematocrit drop while on the floor 
and was found to have melena. She was transferred to the ICU for 
GI bleed and required 12 units of blood in less than 48 hours. 
She had a few EGDs on ___ and on ___ showing clot in stomach 
from a Dieulafoy lesion. The gastroenterologists were unable to 
intervene on first two endoscopies but able to cauterize and 
place clips on the third endoscopy which was performed with 
intubation in the OR for direct visualization. Her hematocrit 
then stabilized, and she was started on a PPI, she had no 
further evidence of GI bleeding during her stay, and GI felt 
that it was safe for her to be started on anticoagulation.  
.
# MSSA bacteremia: The source of her bacteremia was likely her 
left foot given same speciation and sensitivites. There were no 
signs of endocarditis on transthoracic echocardiogram but the 
study was deemed suboptimal.  The patient declined a 
transesophageal echocardiogram but this was felt to not be 
necessary as she will already require a 6 week course of IV 
antibotic therapy.  Due to her new allergy to nafcillin as a 
result of the AIN, her antibiotics were changed to 
vancomycin/ciprofloxacin as above for the bacteremia.   
.
# Left upper extremity deep venous thrombus: She was found to 
have a DVT surrounding her PICC in her left arm.  She was 
initially started on a heparin drip as a bridge to coumadin, the 
left arm PICC was removed and PICC was placed in her right arm.  
She will complete a three month course of coumadin, if she 
becomes subtherapeutic on coumadin there is no indication for 
bridging with heparin, so she can be continued on coumadin until 
her INR is back in the therapeutic range.
.
# Acute renal failure: Patient developed oliguria very soon 
after admission, and urine sediment showed muddy brown casts 
consistent with ATN.  The etiology of her ATN was likely 
hypotension leading to hypoperfusion while she was septic from 
MSSA. Her creatinine steadily improved and returned to near her 
baseline.  Then around ___ her creatinine started to increase 
again, it peaked at 2.0 and renal was consulted.  Examination of 
the urine showed white cells and cellular casts, renal felt that 
this was consistent with AIN, most likely from Nafcillin.  They 
also felt that there was a component of congestive heart failure 
that was also contributing.  Her antibiotics were changed to 
vancomycin and she was started on more aggressive diuresis of 
lasix 80mg IV twice a day.  Given the large amount of excess 
fluid, she will currently be continued on the same dose of IV 
lasix.  If her creatinine increases again, or diuresis starts to 
slow, she can then be transitioned back to an oral dose, she was 
admitted on 40mg po daily.  Creatinine at the time of discharge 
was 1.2, her renal function will need to be continually 
monitored as her vancomycin dosing may change as her renal 
function changes.  We held her valsartan in the setting of her 
renal failure and also while she was getting IV lasix, if she 
needs better blood pressure control can restart valsartan 80mg 
daily if her creatinine is back to her baseline of 1.0.
.  
# RUE weakness: She acutely developed difficulty raising her 
right arm on ___ but had a negative head MRI after code stroke 
was called. Neurology felt this was a brachial plexus 
neuropathy, likely pressure related from non-invasive 
measurements done in the ED. MRI of C-spine showed severe canal 
and foraminal narrowing at C5-6 and C6-7 with cord deformity but 
no signs of abscess. Spine was consulted who recommended a CT 
scan of her C-spine for better evaluation but felt this was 
non-critical.  She should follow-up with the spine clinic after 
discharge and her rehabilitation stay.
.  
# Hypocalcemia with hyperphosphatemia: In the setting of acute 
renal failure, she had a low ionized calcium and 
hyperphosphatemia. Sevelamer was started with meals to help 
correct this imbalance until her renal function improved.  Once 
her renal function improved, the sevelamer was discontinued.
.
# CAD: She had no complaints of chest pain or SOB throughout her 
stay.  She was continued on ASA, plavix and statin initially 
until she developed a GI bleed.  At that time her 
anticoagulation was stopped, and not restarted until a week 
after final EGD.  She was resumed on aspirin and statin but her 
plavix continued to be held given her need for warfarin.  
.
# DM: She was continued on ISS with Lantus.  She needed 
continual uptitration of her lantus dose for improved glycemic 
control.  Her humalog sliding scale from the hospital was 
included in her paperwork.  
.
# Acute on chronic diastolic congestive heart failure: Her EF 
>55% on transthoracic echocardiogram. She was initially 
euvolemic but developed volume overload from IV fluids and blood 
products. She continues to be on aggressive diuresis with lasix 
given her total volume overload, and fact that her renal 
function improved with diuresis she was discharged on 80mg IV 
BID, and will likely need up to a week more of diuresis with IV 
lasix, we would recommend continuing as long as her creatinine 
remains stable.  We held her valsartan in the setting of her 
renal failure and also while she was getting IV lasix, if she 
needs better blood pressure control can restart valsartan 80mg 
daily if her creatinine is back to her baseline of 1.0.  
.
# Dyslipidemia: She was continued on atorvastatin. 
.
# Thyroid nodule: Incidental finding on C-spine MR, elevated TSH 
with normal T4 consistent with sick euthyroid, she will need 
further outpatient follow up of the thyroid nodule after rehab.
