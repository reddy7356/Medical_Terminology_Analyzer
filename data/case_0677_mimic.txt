Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ is a ___ year-old man with past medical history of 
hypothyroidism as well as recent diagnosis of myasthenia ___ 
(currently followed by Dr. ___ and on prednisone 60 and 
imuran 100mg BID) who presents for recurrent fevers of unknown 
origin. He is without respiratory symptoms or weakness and his 
neurological exam is nonfocal. He is admitted for further workup 
of the source of his fever.

PLAN:
- LP with fluoroscopy showed only 1 WBC, no signs of infection 
and empiric coverage with acyclovir that was started in the 
Emergency Room was discontinued
- OSH records from Dr. ___ reviewed:  tick-borne workup 
from earlier this week showed Anaplasmosis, Lyme, Erlichia all 
negative
- per ID recs: we resent urine histoplasma,serum/CSF crypto 
antigen, Lyme, Anaplasma, Erlichia, mycolytic Bcx. These can be 
followed up as outpatient
- f/u CSF studies- Herpes Simplex Virus PCR; Acid Fast (TB) 
Culture; Cryptococcal Antigen; Fungal culture; Viral culture - 
routine; Borrelia burgdorferi Antibody Index for CNS Infection; 
Varicella-Zoster Virus DNA, PCR are pending, but given his lack 
of symptoms and the low likelihood of disseminated neurologic 
infection we did not feel it was necessary to keep the patient 
inpatient while results pend. The studies can be followed up as 
outpatient at his next clinic appointment.  We can fax records 
to his ID physician once an appointment is made.
- NIFs and vital capacity remained normal
-Myasthenia medications: continue home doses of prednisone, 
mestinon and imuran. He will be seen in clinic next month by Dr. 
___

Dear Mr ___, 

It was a pleasure to take care of you at ___

studies that can be followed up as an outpatient the next time 
you see Dr. ___.  The Infectious Disease team did not 
feel it was necessary to continue antibiotics or antivirals but

Infectious Disease doctor as an outpatient. Please remain on all 
your home medications and follow up as listed. Thank you for 
allowing us to participate in your care.
