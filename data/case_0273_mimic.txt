Brief Hospital Course:
Following initial evaluation in the Emergency Department, the 
patient was admitted to the ACS Team and sent to the floor. 
Following extensive discussions with the Orthopedic Spine Team, 
the decision was made to undergo non-operative management of his 
non-displaced cervical and thoracic fractures. Subsequent MRI 
and CT Spine demonstrated stable T-Spine fractures without 
threatened injury to the spinal cord. The decision was made to 
treat these fractures non-operatively with a ___ J Cervical 
Collar and Brace (TLSO). There was also initial concern and 
management for rhabdomyolysis; CK was trended to a maximum of 
1352 and downtrended steadily to normal levels prior to 
discharge. He was treated with aggressive IVFR and his 
electrolytes and renal status were monitored on lab analysis 
daily. 

During the first two days of his admission, the patient became 
very agitated and given his history of alcohol abuse and 
dependence, went into alcohol withdrawal and delirium tremens. 
CIWA protocol was initiated but the patient remained agitated 
and unstable prompting a transfer from the floor to the TSICU to 
begin a Phenobarbital drip. Imaging Results and TSICU course as 
follows.

The following images were ordered and reviewed with the results 
listed below. 

OSH CT C-spine ___:
1. R T1 superior facet non-displaced fracture
2. R C6 transverse foramen non-displaced fracture

OSH CT Abd/pelvis: no renal trauma (laceration/hematoma) no RP 
hematoma, no free fluid in the pelvis, no free air; no e/o 
pelvic fx. the duodenum appears inflamed and thickened but with 
no adjacent stranding. 

OSH CT Head: no evidence of intracranial trauma or skull 
fracture

CTA neck ___ ___: 
Right nondisplaced fracture through the right transverse foramen 
at C6 without evidence of vascular injury. A fracture of the 
right transverse process and inferior articular facet at T1 is 
better evaluated on the CT C-spine ___. No 
dissection, aneurysm or thrombosis.

CT L spine ___ ___:
No fracture or malalignment in the lumbar spine. No significant 
degenerative disease. Small volume hyperdense pelvic fluid, 
slightly increased from prior CT exam, concerning for 
hemoperitoneum. Source of bleeding unknown.

CT chest ___ ___:
Multiple thoracic compression fractures (T3, T4, T5, T6 and T8) 
as well as nondisplaced sternal body fracture. Minimal contusion 
in the medial right lung base.

MRI Spine ___:
1. Study is moderately degraded by motion. 
2. Mild superior endplate compression fractures involving the C7 
through T6 
and T8 vertebral bodies without significant bony retropulsion. 
3. Cervical dorsal soft tissue edema with extension into 
interspinous spaces 
of C4 through T1 concerning for interspinous ligament injury. 
4. Widening of the interspinous interval at T5-T6 with subtle 
irregularity of 
the ligamentum flavum and interspinous ligament at this level 
concerning for 
ligamentous injury. 
5. Nonspecific edema of dorsal soft tissues overlying T1 through 
2 for 
vertebral bodies. 
6. Right C7 transverse foramen and right T1 superior facet 
fractures are 
better characterized on prior CT examination. 
7.  Within limits of study, no definite spinal cord signal 
abnormality. 
8. Right medial lung base contusion, as seen on CT. 
9. Mild cervical degenerative disc disease as described. 

TSICU Course of Events
___: Transferred to TICU from floor for severe alcohol 
withdrawal/delirium tremens. Psychiatry consulted - no acute 
need for ___, phenobarb loading/taper per ICU protocol, 
high-dose thiamine, folate, MVI, Haldol 5 mg IM/IV/PO for acute 
agitation. Required 5 mg IM Haldol, total 20 mg IV Haldol, 2 mg 
IM Lorazepam and total 4 mg IV Lorazepam. Phenobarbital loading 
dose given (10 mg/kg), required rescue dose of 5 mg/kg. QTc 414 
msec. OR cancelled for today - plan for OR with Dr. ___ 
___.

___: Foley removed. Patient assessed in ___ ___, alert and 
oriented, understands nature of injuries and reason for ICU 
admission. Patient denies SI or attempt at self harm. He reports 
that he is full code, designates his mother as his HCP. ICU 
consent signed. Ortho spine paged regarding plan for operative 
management, no response. Per ACS, Ortho Spine plans for 
non-operative management only (cancelled after updated read of 
spinal imaging).

___: Tolerating regular diet, on oral medications. Continued on 
phenobarb taper, transferred to floor. Ortho not to operate, 
will f/u as outpatient.

___: Patient doing well on the floor with no issues or 
complaints indicating EtOH withdrawal or delirium tremens. Final 
Psychiatry consult deemed the patient was stable and reliable to 
be discharged home with appropriate follow up regarding his EtOH 
dependence. Patient continues to tolerate oral intake, pain is 
controlled with oral pain medications, he is voiding and 
stooling normally. He is comfortably with the discharge 
instructions that were discussed with him and his mother who was 
present in room. He will follow up with ACS, Orthopedics Spine, 
Primary Care and Psychiatry as an outpatient.

all times.

 o Do not drive until you have stopped taking pain medicine and 
feel you could respond in an emergency.  
 o You may climb stairs.  
 o You may go outside, but avoid traveling long distances until 
you see your surgeon at your next visit.  
 o Don't lift more than ___ lbs for 4 weeks. (This is about
