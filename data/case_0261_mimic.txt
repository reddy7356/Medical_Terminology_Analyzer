EXAMINATION:  MR HEAD W/O CONTRAST ___ MR HEAD (___) 
  
TECHNIQUE:  Sagittal T1 weighted imaging was performed. Axial 
imaging was 
performed with gradient echo, FLAIR, diffusion, and T2 technique 
were then 
obtained. 
MRV images were acquired of the dural venous sinuses with a 
velocity encoding 
gradient of 10 and 30 cm per second. 
  
COMPARISON  None. 
  
FINDINGS:  
  
The brain is normal in volume, signal intensity and morphology.  
There is no evidence of hemorrhage, edema, masses, mass effect, 
midline shift or 
infarction.   The ventricles and sulci are normal in caliber and 

configuration.  The pituitary appears normal.  The 
craniocervical junction 
appears normal.  The orbits appear normal.  Minimal mucosal 
thickening 
involving the paranasal sinuses.  Vascular flow voids are 
preserved.  No 
evidence of pres. 
  
MRV: The internal cerebral veins, basal vein of ___, vein 
___ and 
___ sinus are patent.  The superior sagittal, transverse 
and sigmoid 
sinuses are patent.  The jugular veins appear patent. 
  
IMPRESSION: 
1. Normal intracranial contents. 
2. Normal MRV.  No dural venous sinus thrombosis. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
On ___, Ms. ___, a ___ G1P0 at 26 weeks and 5 
days was admitted to the antepartum service with generalized 
aches and lower extremity weakness. 

On presentation there was low suspicion for infectious process. 
Initial labs were normal including blood counts, negative 
urinalysis. Exam was notable for difficulty with ambulation 
therefore physical therapy was consulted. She was provided with 
a walker to assist in ambulation; further workup from neurology 
was recommended given acute presentation with bilateral 
presentation. 

Per Neurology recommendation, she had a flu swab drawn which was 
negative. She had respiratory evaluation which was normal with 
NIF -60 and VC 2.2. Neurology evaluation was notable for normal 
respiratory mechanics, functional overlay on motor exam and 
intact reflexes. MRI/MRV was recommended to rule out venous 
sinus thrombosis which was normal with no evidence of 
intracranial pathology. Overall concern was low for acute 
neurologic process and was thought to be due to functional gait 
disorder. 

She continued working with Physical Therapy who recommended 
walker on discharge and home ___ services. Patient was not felt 
to be a candidate for crutches given instability. 

For her history of teen pregnancy, Social Work was consulted who 
arranged supports and outpatient social work. 

On HD#3, patient was ambulating well with a walker and it was 
felt safe for her to be discharged home. She had reassuring 
fetal testing while inpatient. Outpatient care with her primary 
OB was arranged prior to discharge.

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted to the antepartum service for further 
evaluation of lower extremity weakness. The reason for your 
weakness is uncertain, but may be related to stress. You had 
normal head imaging which is reassuring. Physical therapy met 
with you and recommended outpatient physical therapy at home.

Fetal testing was reassuring while you were here.
