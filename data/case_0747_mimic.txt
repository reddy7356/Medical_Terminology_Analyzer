Imaging
Head CT ___ Significant progression of global atrophy somewhat 
more pronounced in the frontal lobes out of proportion for 
patient's age could relate to HIV infection.
 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ yo M with HIV/AIDs, AIDs dementia/encephalopathy, TBI and Sz, 
HCV, and history of impulsive/dangerous behavior, drug use, and 
frequent incarcerations presents with his brother over safety of 
current living situation and plan of care.

# Encephalopathy:  Likely due to multiple chronic insults 
including traumatic ___ injury, chronic HIV/AIDs dementia, 
underlying Anxiety/Mood disorder, and substance abuse.  He was 
hospitalized for ongoing impulsive behavior and anxiety, though 
there was no evidence of aggressive or threatening behavior.   
He displayed hypersexuality while here, with a few episodes of 
masturbation.  

He denied focal symptoms to suggest any superimposed acute 
medical condition like infection, and laboratory workup was 
unremarkable and imaging was without acute findings.  He did 
report recent drug use as well which could have contributed to 
his initial presentation.

In light of the above, Psychiatry, ___, social work were all 
very involved in his care.  OT evaluation recommended 24 
supervision, but the patient strongly preferred to be discharged 
to the street, citing strong desire to go to ___ and get 
treatment with Healthcare for the Homeless. 

There was significant discussion between myself, prior MD, 
psychiatry, and social work.  It was thought that the best and 
safest discharge plan would have involved a group home, but this 
was not feasible.  He was denied from nearly every nursing 
facility, and would have required guardianship for the one place 
willing to take him.  There was no reasonable individual who 
could or would assume guardianship, and this was strongly 
against the patient's wishes.

As his history of the above behavior was well documented and did 
not seem markedly different that over the last few years, and 
given the inability to secure another better plan, it was 
thought that the best possible course of action was to respect 
his desire for autonomy and allow his discharge from the 
hospital.  He and his family were given resources for TBI and 
HIV programs, and the patient himself was given transportation 
to ___ along with instructions to seek care with ___.

# HIV:  He was seen by ID who felt no acute infection was at 
play. HIV VL was suppressed and it was recommended he restart 
his prior regimen once that could be confirmed.  By report, the 
patient was taking medications last a few months ago in prison, 
Stribild 1 tab daily.  He reports HIV care in ___ by Dr. ___ 
at ___. 

# Subclinical hypothyroid:  TSH 6.4.  Recommend outpatient 
repeat testing.

# Chronic HCV.  Will need outpatient follow up and possible 
treatment.

# Tobacco use: ___ packs daily. Was given nicotine patch.  
Cessation counseling provided

Discharge Instructions:

thought to have significant difficulties with impulsivity and 
clear thinking, likely related to prior traumatic brain injury

regarding your capacity to make decisions and care for yourself, 
the options for discharge, and the potential need for 
guardianship. 

You strongly preferred to be discharged to ___ to follow 
up with Healthcare for the Homeless. It was ultimately felt that 
given your age and your ability to function previously, it would 
be reasonable to preserve your autonomy and discharge you to 
___ and Healthcare for the Homeless.

the ___ area that would potentially be available to help take 
care of you, including services for those with HIV and those 
with traumatic brain injuries.
