IMAGING 
===============
1.  Mild central intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation, left 
greater than 
right with mild narrowing of the left hepatic duct at its 
takeoff from the 
common hepatic duct, as well as slight irregularity of the 
intrahepatic bile 
ducts.  Findings are concerning for primary sclerosing 
cholangitis in this 
patient with underlying ulcerative colitis. No evidence of 
active inflammation 
or extrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation.  No evidence of 
cholelithiasis or 
choledocholithiasis. 
  
2.  Two geographic, non masslike areas of parenchymal signal 
abnormality in 
segments ___, suggestive of early fibrosis or focal iron 
deposition.  No 
worrisome hepatic lesion.  These findings may be reassessed on 
follow-up MRCP 
of the pancreas (see below). 
  
4.  1.0 x 0.8 cm cystic lesion in the pancreatic head, as well 
as multiple 
other scattered subcentimeter cystic lesions throughout the 
pancreas, most 
compatible with side-branch IPMNs.  Follow-up MRCP in 6 months 
is recommended 
per departmental protocol. 
  
RECOMMENDATION(S):  Follow-up MRCP of the pancreas in 6 months, 
also to 
include the entire liver. 
 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ year-old woman with ___ year history of ulcerative colitis on 
___ w/ a 2 month treatment of Humira and prednisone taper, 
presented with jaundice and pruritus. She also reported 
___ stools. She was was found to have transaminitis and 
hyperbilirubinemia. 

She was evaluated by GI who felt that this was due to medication 
effect, i.e. altered metabolism of her ___ or Humira, so both of 
these medications were held.  MRCP was done which showed 
evidence of PSC along with pancreatic lesions that a follow-up 
MRCP in 6 months. She was discharged with outpatient follow-up 
by GI and hepatology. She was given ursodiol for PSC and 
pruritis. 

# Jaundice, hepatitis:  Likely due to primary sclerosing 
cholangitis with possible contribution from drug effect
# Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC):  Newly diagnosed
Patient was noted to have significant hyperbilirubinemia along 
with transaminitis in the 100s (ALT > AST). More of a 
cholestatic picture. No CBD dilation seen on RUQ US. Albumin low 
but had normal coags indicating likely intact synthetic 
function. Could be drug related reaction although reports of 
transaminitis on Humira are somewhat rare other than cases of 
viral hepatitis reactivation (less likely given modest elevation 
in ALT, AST, and AP). All HAV, HBV, and HCV, EBV serologies were 
negative indicating no prior exposure apart from positive HbSAb 
consistent with vaccination. Autoimmune serologies also negative 
___, AMA, ___. ___ MP and Humira held due to concern of 
medication induced hepatitis vs. unmasking of autoimmune 
hepatitis. MRCP done with findings concerning for PSC. Will need 
liver biopsy outpatient for staging. Also has cystic lesion on 
pancreas which will need f/u MRCP in 6 months which visualizes 
the pancreas and liver. LFTs trending down on discharge. GI 
recommended outpatient follow-up with Dr. ___ hepatology. 
Discharged with Benadryl and Ursodiol for pruritus and PSC.

# Ulcerative colitis: Diagnosed in ___, with recent relapse in 
___ leading to initiation of Humira as above. No evidence of 
current flare. We continued home prednisone and held ___ and 
Humira upon discharge.

# GERD: developed on prednisone.  Continued home omeprazole.

# Macrocytosis w/o anemia: Stable. Likely ___ medication induced 
hematologic toxicity from ___. 

# Hypoalbumiemia, mild. Given normal INR, less likely to be 
related to hepatic injury. In the setting of chronic diarrhea, 
might be related to UC flares. 

# Hypocalcemia, low-end of normal after correcting for 
hypoalbumiemia. 

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES
====================
- Humira and ___ held - restart after outpatient GI/hepatology 
follow-up
- Thiopurine metabolite levels pending at discharge
---- At the time this discharge summary was signed, the results 
returned and were notable for elevated ___.  I have e-mailed 
her outpatient GI and hepatologist to alert them to this 
finding, as she was recently instructed to restart ___, and they 
confirmed that they were aware of this and the patient was 
started on ___ her prior dose of ___ accordingly
- 1.0 x 0.8 cm cystic lesion in the pancreatic head, as well as 
multiple other scattered subcentimeter cystic lesions throughout 
the pancreas, most compatible with side-branch IPMNs. Follow-up 
MRCP in 6 months is recommended of the pancreas and to include 
the entire liver.
- Outpatient follow-up with Dr. ___ hepatology to be 
arranged by Dr. ___. 
- Will need liver biopsy outpatient

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,

recommended outpatient follow-up with Dr. ___ the liver 
specialists as your liver enzymes were trending towards normal. 
It was a pleasure taking care of you!

We wish you the best,
