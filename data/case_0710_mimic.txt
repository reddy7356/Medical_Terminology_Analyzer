___ LIVER OR GALLBLADDER US
1.  Numerous stones within the distended gallbladder without 
specific 
sonographic evidence for cholecystitis.  If clinical concern for 
acute 
cholecystitis remains high, a HIDA scan may be useful. 
2.  Dilated common bile duct measuring up to 12 mm without 
evidence of 
choledocholithiasis.  An MRCP may be obtained for further 
evaluation.   
  
___  CT ABD & PELVIS WITH CONTRAST

1. S/P RY gastric bypass surgery. Oral contrast within the 
excluded stomach - this finding is consistent with a 
gastrogastric fistula.  
  
2. Intussusception at the jejunojejunal anastomosis.  This 
finding is 
frequently seen as a transient phenomenon and is not causing any 
bowel 
obstruction.  
  
3. Unusual areas of soft tissue attenuation in the fat adjacent 
to the right side of the uterus and more superiorly in the 
suprapubic region. The primary considerations are endometriosis 
or fat infarction (more likely given the fat attenuation). MRI 
pelvis may be of benefit for further evaluation. 
  
4. Mildly dilated common hepatic duct with normal tapering of 
the common bile duct at the ampulla. No intrahepatic duct 
dilatation. MRCP is recommended for further evaluation.

cyclobenzaprine.

Pulmonary: The patient remained stable from a pulmonary 
standpoint; vital signs were routinely monitored. Good pulmonary 
toilet, early ambulation and incentive spirometry were 
encouraged throughout hospitalization.  
GI/GU/FEN: The patient was initially on a clear liquids diet

well tolerated. Patient's intake and output were closely
