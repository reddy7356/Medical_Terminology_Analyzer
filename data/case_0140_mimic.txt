IMAGING:

EKG ___: Sinus tachycardia. Non-specific ST-T wave changes. 
No previous tracing
available for comparison.

CXR (___): The lung volumes are low.  Within the limitations 
of technique, the cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours are 
probably within normal limits.  There is no definite pleural 
effusion or pneumothorax.  Heterogeneous opacification involves 
each mid lung, greater on the right than left, with areas of 
entirely spared lung.  There is no clear finding to suggest an 
abnormal vasculature.   
IMPRESSION:  Findings suggesting pneumonia. 

CXR (___):
A AND LATERAL CHEST X-RAY OF ___
 
COMPARISON:  Radiograph of ___.
 
FINDINGS:  Lung volumes are relatively low, accentuating the 
cardiac
silhouette and bronchovascular structures.  With this limitation 
in mind,
heart is upper limits of normal in size.  Heterogeneous 
bilateral lung
opacities have partially resolved, with residual opacities most 
prominent in
the right upper and both mid lung regions. These residual lung 
findings may
reflect aspiration or infectious pneumonia.  There are no 
pleural effusions or
pneumothoraces.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ is a ___ F with history of asthma and HTN, presented 
with increased cough, fevers, shortness of breath, and myalgias 
with concern for PNA. 
 
# Asthma exacerbation: Patient received albuterol, azithro, and 
CTX with improvement in her symptoms. Flu swab and urine 
legionella negative. She was then switched to po levofloxacin. 
She was initially started on a 3-day burst of prednisone 40 mg 
but was increased to 60 mg prednisone on ___ as her symptoms 
were not improving quickly. She experienced the most difficulty 
with walking and deep breathing, as this caused her to cough and 
resultd in rib pain. During her hospital course, she was 
maintained on pen albuterol  q2hr and ipratroprium nebs q6h. She 
was also continued on home fluticasone-salmeterol, montelukast, 
and cetirizine. She was discharged to complete a 10-day course 
of prednisone. She was also provided a prescription for a 
nebulizer machine as her previous one broke.
  
# Possible pneumonia: Initial CXR was concerning for possible 
pna, but given bilateral findings, it would most likely be 
atypical bacterial or viral etiology. Flu and legionella 
negative. She was initially started on azithro and CTX and then 
switched to levofloxacin. Her diuretic was held as she had 
experienced dizziness at home. Her lactate increased from 2.8 to 
3.2 on ___, likely from albuterol. She was continued on 
levofloxacin for total 7 day course (Day 1 of abx = ___, last 
day ___. For pain control given rib pain with coughing, she 
was maintained on oxycodone, tramadol, and ibuprofen. For cough, 
she was given guaifenisen/benzonatate PRN.
 
# HTN: Patient reports SBP's in the 170's at home and therefore 
has a lower threshold for becoming symptomatic with lower BP's. 
She will need to ___ with PCP for tighter BP control over time. 
Her lisinopril dose was increased to 30mg daily (home dose) on 
___ and her chlorthalidone was held since the patient appeared 
euvolemic and became dizzy with it at home.  

# Insomnia: Chronic, related to shift work, mild OSA (Recently 
diagnosed on sleep study, CPAP not yet obtained). Steroid side 
effects may be a contributing factor. Patient did not feel 
trazodone worked and requested ativan.

Transitional issues:
-Will need to continue levofloxacin for a total 7 day course 
(last day ___
-Will need to continue prednisone for a total 10 day course 
(last day ___
-___ bp control as an outpatient
-Her chlorthalidone was stopped in house given concerns for 
dehydration/dizziness. This medication may be restarted as an 
outpatient with pcp ___.
-She is having trouble with insomnia, not responsive to 
trazodone, that may be exacerbated by steroids. Given lorazepam 
at discharge, further discussions needed about future 
management.

Attending: ___
 
Chief Complaint:
increased seizure frequency
 
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

 
History of Present Illness:
The patient is a ___ year old woman with focal and
generalized seizures on lamotrigine and oxcarbazepine who
presents with cluster of seven witnessed seizures in the context
of 3 months of increasing seizure frequency.

She had her first seizure while at work today, which she
describes as a complex partial seizure, but she does not 
remember
it, and it was reported to her by a co-worker, who told her that
she appeared pale and tearful. Upon having this event, she was
taken to the ED by EMT, and reportedly had a convulsive seizure
en route. She has had 5 more seizures in the ED, mostly observed
by her husband but also by ED staff, who report leg stiffening
and convulsions of the arms with staring and unresponsiveness. 
In
between these episodes, husband reports that she returns to
baseline, but patient reports that she feels foggy in between
events. She does not have a usual seizure frequency, as her
seizures have become more frequent, but the last complex partial
seizure before today was 1 week ago, and the last witnessed
generalized tonic clonic seizure was 1 month ago. She tends to
have 2 seizures at a time, but has never had more than 3 seizure
in a cluster before. She reports excellent compliance with AEDs.
She had a URI with stuffy nose and no fever about 1 week ago and
sore throat 2 days ago. She tends to get sore throat with sleep
apnea, which she states is worsening as she does not have a CPAP
mask. Stress is another trigger for her, and she has been under 
a
lot of stress recently as she is having issues with her husband
and currently receiving counseling. She reports that she did not
feel particularly stressed today. She drank several alcoholic
beverages about 4 nights ago but since then has not had any
alcohol. 

Regarding seizure history, she was diagnosed in ___ with 
2
GTCs, the first of which lasted 7 minutes. She notes that she 
has
had periods of ___ and staring since her childhood. These
events were found to be seizures on EEG. She was initially
trialed on Keppra, then another agent, both of which she was
unable to tolerate due to abdominal pain and diarrhea. She was
treated with oxcarbazepine and lamictal and achieved
seizure-freedom from ___ to ___, at which 
point
she started having recurrent breakthrough seizures. Lamictal has
since been uptitrated by primary neurologist Dr. ___
considered adding a third agent (zonisamide) for continued break
through seizures. Otherwise, she notes that she avoids caffeine
and decongestants. 

Her semiologies are :
1. complex partial- ___ sensation followed by mental
fogginess noted to have staring and lip smacking followed by
fatigue
2. GTC

On neurologic review of systems, the patient denies headache,
lightheadedness, or confusion. Denies difficulty with producing
or comprehending speech. Denies loss of vision, blurred vision,
diplopia, vertigo, tinnitus, hearing difficulty, dysarthria, or
dysphagia. Denies focal muscle weakness, numbness, parasthesia.
Denies loss of sensation. Denies bowel or bladder incontinence 
or
retention. Denies difficulty with gait.

On general review of systems, the patient denies fevers, chest
pain, palpitations, cough, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea,
constipation, abdominal pain, dysuria or rash.

to low inspiratory volumes and lordotic positioning. Minimal 
atelectasis in the right cardiophrenic region is also relate to 
low lung volumes.  Allowing for this, no focal infiltrate or 
consolidation. 
___ Lamotrigrine level 4.1, Oxcarbazepine level 18.8
 
Brief Hospital Course:
#Neuro: ___ F with focal epilepsy not well-controlled with 
lamotrigine, oxcarbazepine, and lorazepam who presented with 
increased seizure frequency. Potential causes included recent 
URI infection with WBC 12.9 vs worsening of her obstructive 
sleep apnea (had not been using CPAP effectively at home) vs 
increased stress in the setting of marital strife for several 
months.  The goal of this admission was to control/decrease her 
seizure frequency, however patient was placed on continuous EEG 
monitoring to better characterize events if they did occur. Her 
initial seizure work-up prior to admission had EEG showing 
epileptiform discharges in the left temporal lobe and her 
seizures were characterized as focal temporal lobe with 
generalization. During her hospital stay, no episodes were 
captured on EEG and her EEG remained normal, with no 
electrographic seizures or epileptiform discharges. 

Imaging performed included chest xray and head CT. The chest 
xray did not show evidence of focal infiltrate such as 
pneumonia. Head CT showed no intracranial abnormality and empty 
sella (which was consistent with the empty sella also noted in 
___ MRI). The patient was found to have an elevated WBC count, 
however she remained afebrile throughout her hospital stay and 
did not have evidence of pneumonia on chest xray nor did she 
have evidence of UTI on urine analysis. On admission, her 
oxcarbazepine level was 18.5, which is within the therapeutic 
range. Her lamotrigine level was 4.1, which is just above the 
lower limit of the therapeutic range. At this point, the 
etiology for her increased seizure frequency is still unclear. 

With respect to anti-epileptic treatment, Zonisamide (started 
___ was added to pt's preadmission AED regimen of 
oxcarbazepine, lamictal, and lorazepam. She is tolerating the 
zonisamide with some mildsleepiness, but no other significant 
side effects. The addition of zonisamide is in keeping with Dr. 
___ primary neurologist) most recent note which 
discussed consideration of zonisamide for breakthrough events. 
Because her admission lamictal level was just above the lower 
limit of the therapeutic range, the plan was made to increase 
her dose to 225mg BID for one week then to 250mg BID.  Dr. 
___ was called and is in agreement with this regimen.   

#Psych: The patient described marital stress over past few 
months and was noted to only have seizures with her husband in 
the room. This raised concern for PNES in addition to her 
epileptic seizures. Additionally, she was reported to have 
expressed thoughts of self harm, but since denied any thoughts. 
Psychiatry was consulted and discussed the ___ multiple 
stressors with her. She was not thought to be depressed or at 
risk for harming herself. Although the patient declined starting 
an SSRI, she was offered outpt follow up and given the 
appropriate contact information.
