the rate is

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ is a ___ year old woman with a history of Alzheimer's 
Dementia who presented to the hospital with lethargy and was 
found to be hypothyroid and in acute renal failure.
.
1. Acute Renal Failure: Likely etiology was prerenal from 
dehydration.  She was given IV fluids and her creatinine 
improved.  Her mental status improved as well with IV fluids.  
Creatinine peak was 2.9 and this improved to 1.7 prior to 
discharge.  She was encouraged to drink more fluids.
.
2. Hypothyroidism: This was due to refusal of levothyroxine at 
her assisted living.  She was put back on her home dose of 
levothyroxine and took it while she was here.
.
3. Mental Status:  Her mental status waxed and waned while she 
was here, consistent with delerium in the setting of advanced 
alzheimer's disease.  Her delerium was due to her acute kidney 
failure and hypothyroidism, as well as new environment from 
being in the hospital.  She had a negative UA on admission and 
was afebrile during her hospitalization.  To manage her 
delerium, she was given PRN haldol 0.5mg and PRN Zydis (Zyprexa 
sl) 2.5mg PO BID PRN.  Zyprexa seemed to work well for her and 
she can continue to take this as needed.
.
4. Goals of Care: Multiple conversations took place with the 
patient's daughter regarding her goals of care.  It was 
important to her daughter that the patient stay at her current 
facility, and she understood that with advanced Alzheimer's 
disease, she may not eat or drink enough to prevent further 
episodes of renal failure.  The decision was made to involve 
hospice in her care and that she would be made comfortable and 
the health care proxy, the patient's daughter, was in agreement 
with this.  It was advised that she not return to the hospital 
if she were to become sicker; however her daughter stated she 
may not be able to do this.  She will continue to recieve 
support from hospice social workers in coping with the decline 
of her mother.
