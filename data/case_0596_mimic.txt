Pertinent Results:
 
IMPRESSION: 
1. No intra-abdominal abscess. No acute intra-abdominal process. 

2. Moderate-sized bilateral pleural effusions, with 
consolidation densities 
in the left lower lobe, could represent pneumonia. 
3. Indeterminate bilateral renal masses may represent complex 
cysts, 
incompletely characterized in this CT. Recommend non-urgent 
renal ultrasound 
to further characterize. 
4. 12-mm hypodense left hepatic lesion, incompletely 
characterized in this 
CT, but could represent a benign hepatic hemangioma. ___ 
consider non-urgent 
abdominal ultrasound to further characterize. 
5. 7-mm LLL pulmonary nodule. In the absence of risk factor for 
lung cancer, 
recommend CT chest follow-up in one year. Otherwise follow-up in 
3 to 6 
months per ___ guideline.

CXR

FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no 
relevant 
change. Mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema with cardiomegaly, 
small bilateral 
pleural effusions, and basal areas of parenchymal opacities. No 
newly 
occurred focal parenchymal opacities. No pneumothorax. 
 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
Impression:

Fever, malaise, LL consolidation, all concerning for Healthcare 
associated pneumonia given recent intubation and procedure 
within the past three days.

? new, mild pulmonary edema with small bilateral pleural 
effusions.

Hospital course:

Despite the above radiographic findings, Mr. ___ had no: 
fevers, chest pain, sob, hypoxemia, chills, or malaise, cough to 
suggest either acute heart failure/pulmonary edema OR pneumonia. 


Given the fact that he had recently been hospitalized and 
intubated, I did start him on empiric antibiotics for healthcare 
associated pneumonia on hospital day one and observed him with 
cultures of the sputum and blood ordered.  He continued to 
appear well, without any complaints whatsoever.  I narrowed the 
antibiotic to empiric levaquin for a planned short (5 day) 
course for ? pneumonia given complaint of fever prior to 
presentation.  He continued to appear well and stated he had NO 
symptoms, felt at baseline.  

Repeat CXR again demonstrated cardiomegaly, mild vascular 
congestion, and small pleural effusions.  His lungs remained 
clear to auscultation and he was without any symptoms of heart 
failure.  I did give him one dose of lasix to which he 
experienced a significant diuresis, but again, he did not report 
any symptoms or subjective change following this. 

Given his well - appearance, he was discharged home with 
instructions below, most importantly, to arrange follow up with 
his cardiologist this week for an echocardiogram and repeat 
evaluation.  While here he was seen by the EP fellow, who had 
nothing to add/no other recommendations. 

Given the incidental findings on his CTAP, I notified his 
primary MD via letter of the need for surveillance and follow up 
and informed Mr. ___.
