STUDIES:
Echocardiogram ___: 
The left atrium is markedly dilated. The right atrium is 
markedly dilated. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color 
Doppler. The estimated right atrial pressure is at least 15 
mmHg. There is severe symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. 
The left ventricular cavity size is normal. There is mild global 
left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 45 %). Right ventricular 
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The ascending 
aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are 
mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic 
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly 
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral 
regurgitation is seen. A transmitral diastolic L wave is present 
on spectral Doppler analysis. This finding corresponds to 
impaired early diastolic relaxation. There is mild pulmonary 
artery systolic hypertension. There is a small posterior 
pericardial effusion. The effusion is echo dense, consistent 
with blood, inflammation or other cellular elements. There are 
no echocardiographic signs of tamponade. 
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of ___, the 
findings are similar. 

CXR ___:
FINDINGS:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest demonstrate 
moderate 
interstitial pulmonary edema with ___ A and B lines and 
indistinct hilar structures.  The heart is mildly enlarged.  No 
large pleural effusion, pneumothorax or focal consolidation 
concerning for pneumonia is identified. IMPRESSION:  Moderate 
interstitial pulmonary edema and mild cardiomegaly. 

EKG ___:
Atrial fibrillation with a mean ventricular rate of 89. Left 
axis deviation. Intraventricular conduction delay. Diffuse 
non-specific repolarization abnormalities. Compared to the 
previous tracing of ___ there is no diagnostic change. 

CXR ___:
FINDINGS:  Portable upright frontal view of the chest. There has 
been marked improvement in the interstitial pulmonary edema seen 
one day prior.  Mild cardiomegaly persists.  Likely tiny 
bilateral pleural 
effusions are seen.  No pneumothorax. IMPRESSION:  Definite 
improvement in the pulmonary edema since one day prior.

         positive for Staphylococcus aureus, yeast or other 
fungi. 
         FINAL SENSITIVITIES. 
         Staphylococcus species may develop resistance during 
prolonged
         therapy with quinolones.   Therefore, isolates that are 
initially
         susceptible may become resistant within three to four 
days after
         initiation of therapy.  Testing of repeat isolates may 
be
         warranted.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ is a ___ M w/ DM type I, diastolic CHF EF 45%, and 
Renal transplant ___ c/b chronic allograft nephropathy who 
presents with progressive dyspnea then found to have fever, 
hypoxemia requiring CPAP, and bilateral opacities on CXR 
concerning CHF with possible infectious source prompting 
admission to ICU for mgmt of hypoxemia.

# Hypoxemic Respiratory failure: Most c/w acute on chronic CHF 
w/ clear sx of volume overload on CXR. BNP 24,000. Briefly on 
CPAP in ED which was not well tolerated. Arrived to MICU on 
venturi mask. Was initially placed on lasix drip and metolazone 
with good diuretic response and improvement in his respiratory 
status. Transferred to heart failure service where he was 
euvolemic and breathing comfortably on room air through rest of 
admission. 

# Fever / Leukocytosis/Bacteremia: Likely due to bacteremia. 
Blood cultures grew pan-sensitive coagulase positive staph. At 
increased risk for infections give immunosuppression for hx 
renal transplant. Had fever, lactate 2.9 and WBC 15 on admission 
in ED then given Vanc/Cefepime x1. Only localizing sx is dyspnea 
and one day of nonproductive cough. Chest xray with edema. U/A 
neg. The patient was initially treated with vancomycin for his 
positive cultures and was transitioned to cefazolin once 
sensitivities returned. Surveillance cultures negative. 
Discharged with 9 remaining days of 14-day course of cefezolin 
via midline which was placed prior to discharge. 

# ESRD ___ Renal transplant ___: post-op course complicated by 
delayed graft function and hydronephrosis ___ ureteral stent and 
percutaneous nephrostomy in ___. During his hospitalization he 
was followed by renal transplant team and was continued on his 
prednisone, cyclosporine, and bactrim. Cyclosporine levels were 
monitored with no change in dosing. His renal function was 
mildly decreased below baseline at time of discharge (Cr 
3.7->4.3) likely ___ diuresis with possible role of cyclosporine 
and/or worsening allograft nephropathy. Alternative options were 
explored instead of placing midline for abx but as it was only 
feasible option for discharge midline was placed prior to 
discharge. Home torsemide was held at discharge given euvolemia 
and elevated Cr and pt will require follow up for when to 
restart.   

# CHF, EF 45% in ___ w/ diastolic dysfunction; 1+ MR in 
___. Current presentation c/w acute exacerbation. He was 
diuresed as above. His lisinopril was held while diuresing. His 
metoprolol was continued. After transfer from MICU to heart 
failure service patient had no further volume overload or 
respiratory distress.

# CAD ___ stent of Ramus Intermedius in ___: No active issues. 
Continued home medications of metoprolol, pravastatin, aspirin. 
His lisinopril was held while diuresing. 

# Atrial Fibrillation: Hx paroxysmal, now persistent per 
Cardiology. On warfarin for CHADS2 score of at least 3. 
Continued warfarin, metoprolol. 

# Diabetes Mellitus, Type I: since age ___. C/b ESRD ___ 
transplant. Continued home Lantus & Humalog SS. 

# Hypertension: No active issues. Continued home amplodipine, 
metoprolol. Initially held lisinopril with diuresis.  

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
- The patient's fludrocortisone was held at admission due to 
evidence of fluid overload. He takes this medication chronically 
for orthostatic hypotension. The patient should f/u with his PCP 
about restarting this medication. 
- The patient's lisinopril was held with diuresis. His 
lisinopril should be restarted after discharge for treatment of 
CHF, HTN.
- The patient should discuss whether there is continued benefit 
of bactrim for prophylaxis with his nephrologist.
-The patient has a midline which we require removal at the end 
of his abx course. 
-The patient's home torsemide dose was held at discharge due to 
elevated Cr and euvolemia. He should follow up with his 
cardiologist about when to restart.
-The patient should follow up with his cardiologist about 
starting telehealth monitoring at home.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___, 

You were admitted to ___ with 
excess fluid in your body that made it difficult to breathe. You 
were initially admitted to the intensive care unit where you 
were given IV diuresis to eliminate fluid. You were successfully 
brought back to your dry weight and transferred to the 
cardiology service. On admission, it was discovered that you had 
a fever and had Staph aureus (bacteria) in your blood so you 
were started on IV antibiotics.  A 'midline', a type of larger 
IV was placed so that you can have your antibiotics at home for 
the next 9 days. Your kidney function is somewhat reduced from 
normal so your home oral diuretic was held on discharge. 

You should follow up with your primary care doctor, 
___, and nephrologist at the appointments below. Your 
cardiologist will tell you when to restart your torsemide. You 
should weigh yourself every morning and call Dr. ___ 
weight goes up more than 3 lbs.  Please be careful over

Studies
CT head ___
There is no evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage, mass 
effect or shift of normally midline structures. There is no 
cerebral edema or loss of gray-white matter differentiation to 
suggest an acute ischemic event. Sulci and ventricles are 
prominent, likely age related involutional changes. Mild 
confluent periventricular hypodensities, likely represent 
sequela of small vessel ischemic disease. A focal hypodensity of 
in the right putamen (2:17), may represent a remote lacunar 
infarct or a prominent ___ space.  Extensive 
intracranial and extracranial vascular calcifications are noted. 
 Rounded density within the right maxillary sinus, likely 
represents a retention cyst. The remainder of paranasal sinuses 
and mastoid air cells appear well aerated. 
.
CT C-spine ___
There is no evidence of acute fracture or malalignment. 
Multilevel 
degenerative disc disease involving the cervical spine is most 
pronounced at C5-C6 and C6-C7 with endplate sclerosis and 
intervertebral disc space 
narrowing. There is posterior disc osteophyte complex formation 
at the 
corresponding levels with mild impingement on the thecal sac. 
There is no 
critical central canal stenosis.  Imaged lung apices demonstrate 
thickening of interlobular septae compatible with intersitial 
edema. Thyroid displays homogeneous attenuation. Extensive 
vascular calcifications are noted. Round density projecting over 
right maxillary sinus is partially imaged and likely represents 
a retention cyst. 1. No evidence of acute fracture or 
malalignment. Multilevel degenerative 
disc disease of the cervical spine, as described above. In the 
setting of 
high clinical suspicion for ligamentous or cord injury, may 
consider MR for further assessment. 2. Instersitial edema in 
imaged lung apices. 
.
AP SUPINE VIEW OF THE CHEST, THREE VIEWS OF RIGHT-SIDED RIBS: 
Heart remains moderately enlarged. The mediastinal and hilar 
contours are stable. There is moderate interstitial pulmonary 
edema, which appears slightly worse in the interval. Previously 
noted right pleural effusion and right basilar opacification has 
essentially resolved. There is no pneumothorax or left-sided 
pleural effusion visualized. A BB marker indicating the site of 
patient's tenderness is located adjacent to the sixth right 
lateral rib.  Irregularity of this rib is compatible with a 
remote fracture, as seen on the prior chest CT from ___. No acute fractures are visualized.  Multiple clips are 
demonstrated within the right upper quadrant of the abdomen. 
IMPRESSION: No acutely displaced rib fractures visualized, with 
remote right lateral sixth rib fracture. Moderate interstitial 
pulmonary edema. 
.
Scrotal U/S
The patient reports a longstanding history of swelling in the 
right 
hemiscrotum, which is also corroborated with a CT from ___, 
which shows right-sided hydrocele in the imaged portion of the 
scrotum. On 
today's examination, a complex-appearing hydrocele is again 
present in the 
upper part of the right hemiscrotum with internal echoes and 
septations 
(images 1 through 4). There is marked enlargement of the scrotum 
on gross 
inspection, which corresponds to a 5.2 x 6.6 x 8.0 cm 
heterogeneously echoic collection without internal vascularity, 
which is consistent in appearance with a hematoma. While on 
initial imaging, this appeared to be located in the left 
hemiscrotum, views obtained with a curved transducer showed that 
the hematoma is located in the right inferior hemiscrotum (image 
75). The left testis is displaced superiorly towards the 
inguinal region. The right testis is slightly displaced by the 
right hemiscrotal hematoma and measures 3.6 x 1.6 x 5.4 cm. 
Normal color flow and waveforms are identified within the right 
testis using color and spectral Doppler analysis. The testis 
shows a homogeneous and symmetric echotexture without evidence 
of laceration.  The left testis, also displaced, measures 2.4 x 
2.9 x 4.0 cm and shows a homogeneous echotexture with normal 
color flow and waveforms. There is a trace left-sided hydrocele. 
Vascular calcifications are noted bilaterally.  On the right, 
the epididymal head contains a tiny epididymal cyst. The 
bilateral epididymides demonstrate normal echogenicity. 
IMPRESSION: 1. The marked scrotal enlargement correlates with a 
heterogeneously echoic hematoma located within the right 
hemiscrotum measuring 8 cm with no internal vascularity. There 
is no evidence of testicular parenchymal abnormality, though 
both right and left testes are displaced by the hematoma. No 
sonographic evidence of testicular torsion or vascular 
compromise. Recommend followup imaging after resolution of 
symptoms to confirm resolution of the right testicular 
collection. 2. Complex right-sided hydrocele and trace 
left-sided hydrocele. The complex right-sided component has been 
present since at least ___. 
.
CXR ___
Mild to moderately severe interstitial pulmonary edema has 
improved since 
___. Mildly enlarged heart size is unchanged. 
Mediastinal and hilar contours are stable. There are no discrete 
lung opacities concerning for an superadded or coexisting 
pneumonia. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. 
IMPRESSION: Mild to moderately severe interstitial pulmonary 
edema has improved since ___. Mildly enlarged 
heart size is stable. 
.
CT Abd/Pelvis/chest ___
CT OF THE THORAX: There is diffuse alveolar consolidation 
involving all 
lobes, particularly the lower lobes as well as thickening of the 
interlobular septa. There are small bilateral pleural effusions. 
Air bronchograms are noted coursing through the areas of 
consolidation. The thyroid gland is unremarkable. There is no 
supraclavicular or axillary lymphadenopathy. There are several 
prominent mediastinal lymph nodes (2:25) that do not meet 
pathologic criteria. Hilar lymphadenopathy cannot be assessed 
due to consolidation. A 10-mm calcification adjacent to the 
brachiocephalic artery (2:13) is stable from ___. 
There is cardiomegaly and atherosclerotic calcifications of the 
coronary arteries. Hypodensity of the cardiac chambers is 
suggestive of anemia. There are atherosclerotic calcifications 
of the aortic arch. Mitral annulus is calcified. A small hiatal 
hernia is again noted. CT OF THE ABDOMEN: Surgical mesh for 
repair of the ventral hernia is stable. No focal liver lesions 
are identified on this non-contrast CT. Post-surgical clips from 
prior right adrenalectomy are noted. The gallbladder is 
distended, likely due to fasting. The pancreas is not well 
visualized, and is likely 
atrophic. The left adrenal gland is normal. The native kidneys 
are atrophic. There are diffuse calcifications of the abdominal 
vasculature. There is no mesenteric or retroperitoneal 
lymphadenopathy. There is no free air or free fluid. The small 
bowel is unremarkable. CT OF THE PELVIS: The appendix is normal. 
There is sigmoid diverticulosis without evidence of 
diverticulitis. The rectum, seminal vesicles, and prostate are 
unremarkable. A Foley catheter is noted in the lumen of the 
gallbladder. There is no pelvic lymphadenopathy or free fluid. 
The renal transplant is remarkable. OSSEOUS STRUCTURES: There is 
severe intervertebral disc space narrowing and endplate 
sclerosis at L3-L4. There are no suspicious osseous lytic or 
blastic lesions. IMPRESSION: 1. Extensive bilateral pulmonary 
consolidation and septal edema, consistent with pulmonary edema. 
Bilateral small pleural effusions. 2. Severe degenerative 
changes of the lumbar spine at L3-L4. No other CT findings to 
explain acute back pain. 3. Cardiomegaly and coronary artery 
disease. 
.
CXR ___- Since ___, mild pulmonary edema, 
small bilateral pleural effusions and bilateral lower lung 
atelectasis (left side more than right), have improved. Mildly 
enlarged heart size, mediastinal and hilar contours are stable. 
There is no pneumothorax. 
  IMPRESSION: Since ___, mild pulmonary edema, 
small effusions and left lower lung atelectasis have improved. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ is a ___ year old male with history of atrial 
fibrillation (on coumadin), diastolic heart failure, ___ renal 
transplant (on mycophenolate, cyclosporine, prednisone 
immunosuppresion), failed pancreas transplant, hypertension, 
admitted for injuries sustained after mechanical fall and 
dyspnea, transferred to MICU for hypoxia. 

# Hypoxia: History of chronic diastolic heart failure with 
recent exacerbations over the past several months, has been 
getting diuresed prior to transfer to the ICU but continued to 
be hypoxic on NRB. BNP >15000 which was actually decreased from 
most recent BNP in ___ although still signficantly 
elevated. Temporal association of increasing hypoxia ___ FFP 
tranfusion raises suspicion of fluid overload (transfusion 
association circulatory overload).  CXR consistent with fluid 
overload, but also could not rule out infectious process in 
patient that has underlying immunosuppression.  He did develop a 
fever in the MICU and CT torso showed multifactorial pneumonia 
and Right-sided effusion.  He was treated with diuresis and 
antibiosed for 8 days with vancomycin/zosyn/levofloxacin for 
HCAP.  ECG showed atrial fibrillation with changes c/w old ECGs, 
however new T wave changes in V5/V6, so his cardiac enzymes were 
trended and remained flat.  He was never intubated or placed on 
bipap. He was weaned off high flow mask and was satting well on 
nasal cannula so was transferred to the general medicine floor.  
He was -1.8L fluid after ICU stay with elevated JVD suggesting 
he was still volume up so he was continued on lasix at 80mg po 
BID per renal recs. He was discharged on lasix 60mg po BID. On 
the floor, he was weaned off of oxygen with continued diuresis.  
At the time of discharge, his oxygen saturations were 92-94% on 
RA at rest, and 89-94% when ambulating.
.
# Acute on chronic renal failure: ___ renal transplant in ___. 
Creatinine was within patient's typical baseline range on 
admission.  He was continued on his immunosuppressive regimen 
(mycophenolate, cyclosporine, and prednisone).  Mycophenolate 
was initially decreased to half dose in setting of infection, 
but was back to home dose on transfer to the floor.  Cinacalcet 
was discontinued as patient's calcium was low.  This should be 
restarted based on outpatient follow-up labs.  Calcium 
supplementation was continued. Bactrim SS prophylaxis was 
continued throughout admission.  Per transplant nephrology 
recommendations, patient was started on renogel 800mg TID with 
meals.  Creatinine bumped slightly with lasix, and lasix was 
decreased to 60mg BID at the time discharge.  Patient will need 
creatinine rechecked on ___.
.
# Acute onset back pain: In setting of elevated INR w/ scrotal 
hematoma retroperitoneal bleed is possible, although INR was 
only midly elevated and his hematocrit has been stable. This 
pain was different in nature and location from his pain ___ 
fall.  A CT torso was performed which showed no aortic pathology 
or RP bleed but did show a single non-displaced rib fracture.  
His pain was controlled with tylenol, oxycodone and lidocaine 
patch and his hemotocrit remained stable.  
.
# Atrial fibrillation: INR supratherapeutic. Coumadin held and 
was reversed with FFP 4 units and vitamin K 5mg due to concern 
for RP bleed as above.  Restarted coumadin on ___, and 
patient was slowly titrated up to 4mg on the day of discharge.  
INR was 1.6 on the day of discharge, and patient will need INR 
checked at ___ clinic on ___.
.
# Right scrotal hematoma: Secondary to fall and supratherapeutic 
INR. Has been evaluated by Urology, no acute interventions 
needed during this admission. Groin was monitored; it remained 
stable and pt reported decrease in size at the time of discharge 
to the general medicine floor.
.
# Adrenal insufficiency ___ right adrenalectomy in ___: 
Continued home regimen of fludricortisone.  
  
# Anemia: Patient appears to be around his typical baseline. 
Anemia secondary to kidney failure.    
  
# Type I diabetes mellitus: Continued home glargine regimen and 
provided sliding scale insulin.  
  
# Coronary artery disease (CAD) ___ stent of Ramus Intermedius 
in ___: Continued home aspirin and statin therapy.  
  
# GERD: Continued home pantoprazole.  
  
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
# Will need INR and creatinine checked on ___
# Cinacalcet held at time of discharge. Check ca/phos/PTH levels 
as outpt
# Started renogel 800mg TID
# Lasix increased to 60mg PO BID as outpt
# Repeat testicular U/S once this acute episode resolves, to see 
if there is an underlying predisposition to bleeding, urology 
follow-up appointment scheduled

Brief Hospital Course:
He was admitted to the transplant service for pre-op management 
in anticipation
of adrenalectomy the next day, but surgery was postponed 2 days 
in order to continue IV hydration and up titration of alpha 
blockade per endocrinology to prevent intraop hypertension and 
postop hypotension. 

On ___, he underwent right adrenalectomy and ventral hernia 
repair with mesh for Pheochromocytoma and ventral hernia. 
Surgeon was Dr. ___. Please refer to operative note. A 
___ ___ drain was placed beneath the flaps. He had BPs ~ 200 on 
Nitroprusside with sudden drop to ___ with use of phenylephrine. 
BP stabilized and pressure support was weaned off. PACU course 
was notable for extubation and BP stabilized. One unit of PRBC 
was given. He deveoped hypoglycemia. Several amps of dextrose 
were given and a 20% Dextrose continuous infusion was given. 
Endocrinology felt this was due to abrupt catecholamine 
withdrawal. He was given Hydrocortisone 100mg then prednisone 
5mg qd was started. He was transferred to the SICU for 
management. Dextrose was weaned off and an IV drip was started 
to prevent ketoacidosis.

intraop and neoral toxicity. Urine lytes were consistent with 
ATN. Home dose of Neoral continued at 100mg bid. A renal U/S was 
done showing no hydronephrosis or perinephric fluid collection 
of the left lower quadrant transplanted kidney. Resistive 
indices ranged from 0.81 to 0.87 which were stable, with a 
stable slightly echogenic appearance of the transplanted kidney. 

  
On ___, he had a temp of 101.7. UA was positive with 29 wbc,

Insulin drip was stopped and Lantus with sliding scale was 
added. Blood sugar control improved. IV hydration was 
discontinued due to some sob. O2 was 96% RA. CXR on ___ 
revealed mild pulmonary congestion. CXR on ___ showed a right 
lower lobe opacity unchanged, a small right pleural effusion and
