Chief Complaint:
Stage IIIB melanoma, right axillary adenopathy
 
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Right axillary lymphadenectomy ___ - Dr. ___

 
History of Present Illness:
I saw ___ today for her initial
postoperative visit after performing partial amputation of the
distal right index finger and right axillary sentinel lymph node
biopsy on ___.  I was to have seen ___ in one week for
suture removal, but because of ongoing discomfort in the finger
and because of my desire to discuss her pathology with her in
person, I had her come in today.  She was accompanied by her
daughter, ___.  I spoke to her in the presence of a hospital
___ interpreter.  This almost ___ woman
initially upon biopsy had a 0.53 mm, ___ level III lesion with
one mitosis and ulceration.  The base was broadly positive.  The
pathology from ___ shows a 2.7 mm invasive melanoma
extending to ___ level IV with three associated mitoses per
mm2.  I recovered two right axillary lymph nodes, one of which
contains multiple deposits of micrometastatic tumor.  Her final
staging is therefore T3b N1a or overall stage IIIB.

Since her surgery, ___ has had intermittent neuritic pain of
the index finger, which will last only a few seconds, but which
can be quite intense.  She has also had an area of hyperesthesia
in her upper inner arm closer her axillary incision.  She has
noted some swelling of the incision.

Past Medical History:
PAST ONCOLOGIC HISTORY:
Ms. ___ and ___ daughter report that she had noticed some
trouble with her right index finger fingernail some time prior 
to
presentation.  The reports vary from a few months to up to ___
years.  She notes that initially the fingernail cracked and
separated from the nail bed.  She noticed a flesh colored bump
which eventually oozed blood and started to smell bad. She
brought this to the attention of her PCP ___ was
referred to dermatology for evaluation. She saw dermatology on
___ and was noted to have a "right second finger with
hyperkeratotic ulcerated lesion undermining the nail and with
associated onycholysis." A shave biopsy was performed which
unfortunately showed a minimally pigmented melanoma with depth
0.53 mm, clarks level III, one mitosis per millimeter square,
likely ulceration.  The tumor was present at the deep margin so
the true depth was not determined. She was referred to the
cutaneous oncology program for management and met with Dr. ___.
A recommendation was made for partial amputation of the finger
and sentinel lymph node biopsy which was done in conjunction 
with
Dr. ___ from orthopedic hand surgery on ___. Excision of the primary showed a final depth of 2.7 mm and
widely negative margins. The sentinel lymph node biopsy
unfortunately showed subcapsular deposits of melanoma in one of
two recovered lymph nodes. The patient then had staging CT scans
which showed no evidence of metastatic disease in the head chest
abdomen or pelvis.She then went on to have on ___ a
completion lymph node dissection of the right axilla. None of 
the
nine recovered lymph nodes had melanoma. She thus has a final
stage of T3bN1a stage IIIb.

STUDIES:  
___ CT CHEST W CONTRAST
1. No acute findings. No focal consolidation to suggest 
pneumonia. Unchanged appearance of NSIP pattern fibrosis.  
2. Fluid collection in the area of the right axilla which is 
partially imaged but measures at least 8.9 x 5.4 cm, increased 
from prior exam. 
3. Stable mild dilation of the main pulmonary artery, which 
could suggest pulmonary arterial hypertension in the right 
clinical setting. 
4. Rounded hyperdensities in the area of the right glenohumeral 
joint, possibly representing synovial osteochondromatosis

___ CXR
Low lung volumes with chronic interstitial opacities compatible 
with 
previously characterized NSIP. Slightly increased patchy 
opacities in the lung bases may reflect superimposed 
atelectasis, however infection is difficult to exclude. 

___ ECG
NSR 83 bpm, normal axis, LVH by voltage criteria, no significant 
change from prior

TTE ___:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left 
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is 
normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal 
(LVEF = 70%). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests a normal left 
ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg). Right ventricular 
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic arch is 
mildly dilated. There are focal calcifications in the aortic 
arch. The number of aortic valve leaflets cannot be determined. 
The aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened. There is 
mild aortic valve stenosis (valve area = 1.7 square cm). Mild 
(1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are 
mildly thickened. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. The 
pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined. 
There is no pericardial effusion. 

 IMPRESSION: mild aortic stenosis; mild aortic regurgitation  

 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ with HTN, DM, arthritis (RA/OA), CAD, possible hx CHF, 
depression, and Stage IIIb acral melanoma s/p finger amp and 
lymph node dissection who was admitted with fevers, weakness, 
cough and found to be influenza B positive with significant
bronchospasm and mild CK elevation -- all very consistent with 
influenza infection. Her course has been complicated by 
worsening hypoxemic respiratory failure in the setting of volume 
administration, requiring lasix, along with delirium in setting 
of Ativan.

1.  Influenza:  Completed course of ostelamavir (conservative 
dosing of daily for borderline Cr, pharmacy guided). 

2.  Bronchospasm:  likely triggered by influenza, now much 
improved with standing and PRN bronchodilator regimen. 
Transitioned to PRN nebs.

3.  Hypoxic respiratory failure, acute diastolic CHF 
exacerbation. Developed increasing rales on exam and CXR with 
bilateral pulm edema, likely acute diastolic HF
exacerbation in setting of volume administration.  She was 
diuresed with Lasix 10 mg IV x1 with improvement, and then 
started on Lasix 20mg PO daily. Her BMP has been stable with 
this, and resp status is improving.  TTE showing normal EF and 
no significant valvular disease. She was weaned off oxygen and 
ambulating on room air prior to discharge.

4.  Rhabdomyolysis: Mild elevation CK, likely from influenza, 
received IVF initially, now downtrending (tolerated Lasix 
admin).

5.  NSIP pattern: seen on CT scan, needs outpatient f/u with 
pulmonary.

6.  Hypertension:  Stable on valsartan and amlodipine.

7.  Delirium:  Mild. Resolved. Withhold benzodiazepines.

8.  Diabetes:  Stable on home metformin and SSI.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the orthopaedic surgery service and 
was taken to the operating room for a left total shoulder 
arthroplasty. Please see operative report for details. The 
surgery was uncomplicated and the patient tolerated the 
procedure well. Pain was initially controlled with a PCA 
followed by a transition to oral pain medications on POD#1.  The 
patient received IV antibiotics for 24 hours postoperatively. 
The foley was removed on POD#2 and the patient was voiding 
independently thereafter. The surgical dressing was changed on 
POD#2 and the surgical incision was found to be clean and intact 
without erythema or abnormal drainage. 

While in the hospital, the patient was seen daily by physical 
and occupational therapy. Labs were checked throughout the 
hospital course and repleted accordingly. At the time of 
discharge the patient was tolerating a regular diet and feeling 
well.  On POD#1 became febrile to 102.  Fever work-up, to 
include blood and urine cultures, and a chest xray, was 
negative.  At discharge, the patient was afebrile with stable 
vital signs.  The patient's hematocrit was acceptable and pain 
was adequately controlled on an oral regimen. The operative 
extremity was neurovascularly intact and the wound was benign. 
The patient progressed well with physical therapy. 
Post-operative Xrays demonstrated hardware in good position. The 
patient was discharged in stable condition.  The patient's
