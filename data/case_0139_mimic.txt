XR T-SPINE:
There is a flowing anterior osteophyte seen along the anterior 
margin of the mid-to-lower thoracic spine suggesting a mild form 
of skeletal hyperostosis including formation of more discrete 
osteophytes along the anterior and right lateral margins of the 
spine along lower levels. The vertebral body heights and disc 
spaces appear preserved. There is no evidence for fracture, 
dislocation or bone destruction. A fine reticular abnormality 
involving the lungs is discussed in a separate chest radiograph 
report of the same day.  
IMPRESSION: Skeletal hyperostosis and mild degenerative change, 
but no 
evidence for fracture or dislocation. 

CXR:  The heart is normal in size. The mediastinal and hilar 
contours appear within normal limits. There is no pleural 
effusion or pneumothorax.  Moderate generalized irregular 
reticular pattern of opacification is noted in each lung, 
although without focal discrete opacity. 
IMPRESSION: Widespread fine reticular abnormality. This 
appearance may 
reflect chronic interstitial lung disease. In the appropriate 
clinical 
setting, vascular congestion superimposed on a background of 
abnormal lung architecture could also be considered as the 
etiology, although it may be entirely chronic. Comparison with 
prior films, if available, is recommended as well as pertinent 
historical information.
.
L.shoulder xray:
FINDINGS: No previous images. No evidence of acute fracture, 
dislocation or 
significant degenerative change. There is a relatively high 
position of the 
humeral head with respect to the glenoid fossa, though no 
radiographic 
measurements for impingement 
 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ with alzheimers admitted s/p fall.  

# Fall - clearly mechanical by daughter's history, though 
repidity of falls is concerning seems to be a combination of 
poor vision and lack of insight due to dementia.  Patient 
appears to have a significant amount of family and social 
supports with a longterm plan in place, but difficult to 
implement due to fincial consideration.  Patient complained of 
left arm and mid back pain but xrays were negative for acute 
processes.  Patient's pain well controlled on standing tylenol.  
Though transfered for ___ ventricular bleed our radiologists and 
neurosurgeons did not believe there to be hemorrhage and no 
surgical interventions were performed or recommended.  
Physical therapy  initially felt patient would benefit from 
inpatient admission to rehab. However, upon reevaluation, pt was 
deemed to be safe for discharge with home ___. family elected for 
home discharge with increased home services while patient 
awaited longterm placement at inpatient alzhiemers unit a the 
___
.
# Hypertension - stable, continued lisinopril  

# HLD - stable, continued statin  

# Alzheimers - stable, continued on home meds

felt you would benefit from additional rehab and you were 
transfered for further care.

The following changes were made to your medications:
