___ CT Abd/pelvis :There is an irregular fluid collection in 
the pelvis with fluid surrounding the sigmoid colon.  The 
findings are likely due to
perforated diverticulitis and abscess formation.  The abscess 
appears
multilocular about 7 cm in diameter.  

___ CT Abd/pelvis :
1. Bilateral pleural effusions with associated compressive 
atelectasis.  
2. Some decrease in size of the main multiloculated pelvic fluid 
collection secondary to perforated sigmoid diverticulum.Smaller 
pockets of air and gas are seen surrounding the sigmoid colon.  
Again, the collection is not amenable to transcutaneous 
drainage. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. ___ was evaluated by the Acute Care team in the 
Emergency Room and subsequently admitted to the SICU for further 
management od her perfforated sigmoid diverticulitis as she was 
hypotensive and in rapid atrial fibrillation.  As she was fluid 
resuscitated her heart rate and blood pressure returned to 
normal.  She maintained NPO, bowel rest and IV antibiotics as a 
conservative treatment.  Her WBC was rising and her pain was 
controlled with narcotics.

Interventional Radiology was then consulted about drainage of 
her pelvic abscess but felt the area was too difficult to reach. 
A deciision was made to continue conservative treatment another 
day to see if she improved.  Unfortunately her WBC continued to 
rise and her abdominal pain persisted.  She was taken to the 
Operating Room on ___ and underwent an exploratory 
laparotomy with lysis of adhesions and drainage of pelvic 
abscess.  She tolerated the procedure well and returned to the 
SICU in stable condition.  She did require reintubation after 
arriving in the SICU as she was hypoventilating but was easily 
extubated the following day.

Following transfer to the surgical floor on ___ she 
continued to make steady progress.  She remained afebrile and 
her WBC was normal.  Her antibiotics were changed from IV Zosyn 
and Vancomycin to oral Cipro and Flagyl on ___.

Her creatinine was noted to be elevated to 1.4, she was given IV 
fluid bolus and labs were re-checked. Her other electrolytes 
were repleted as indicated. A renal ultrasound on ___ showed 
no obstruction. Her repeat Cr was 1.3 on ___ pm. She wished to 
go home at this time and she was ready for discharge on ___, 
with follow-up at ___. Patient was ambulating, tolerating 
diet at this time. 

It was noted that her TSH was elevated (7.2) during her hospital 
stay which she will need repeated as an outpatient during her 
follow up with her PCP.

Moderate cardiomegaly is chronic. Lung volumes are once again

There are no areas of consolidation. There is mild residual 
edema in the 
right lung and plate-like atelectasis at the left base. Pleural 
effusions are small if any. No pneumothorax. Nasogastric tube 
passes into the upper 
stomach. No pneumothorax. 

___:  chest x-ray:

Greater opacification at the base of the right lung could be due 
to worsening atelectasis. Low lung volumes also exaggerate mild 
cardiomegaly, probably unchanged. Left upper lung grossly clear. 
Pleural effusions are small if any on the right. No 
pneumothorax. 

  

 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ year old female presented for elective sigmoid resection 
following episode ___ diverticulitis requiring 
laparoscopic washout.  Intra-operatively patient demonstrated 
active disease in the pelvis with multiple pockets of purulence 
in the pelvis.  Presence of this active disease and difficult 
dissection precluded primary anastomosis. An epidural catheter 
was placed pre-operatively for control of her post-operative 
pain.  Following surgery, the patient was admitted to the acute 
care surgery service on ___ and had an elective sigmoid 
resection with ___ procedure.  The patient tolerated the 
procedure well and was brought to the PACU in stable condition 
before transfer to the floor.  

Her post operative course was complicated by hypotension to SBP 
___ on floor in setting afib w RVR.  Epidural rate decreased and 
patient given fluids and IV metoprolol. She also was reported to 
have a hematocrit of 22 and required packed red blood cells. Her 
blood pressure improved slightly, but she continued in afib  
necessitating ICU transfer on POD #1.  In the ICU, the patient 
was monitored and continued on intravenous lopressor.   When 
tolerating po's on POD #2, the patient was started on home 
medication regimen at half dose.  As this proved effective 
patient transferred to the surgical floor.   

Patient completed post-op course of cephalexin. On POD #3, she 
resumed her coumadin, but was reported to have an elevated INR 
and her coumadin was held for the remainder of her 
hospitalization.  On the day of discharge on ___, INR remained 
elevated at 3.5, but stable and downtrending. She was discharged 
with instructions to follow up with her PCP and have an INR 
recheck on ___.
Her vital signs remained stable and she was afebrile. She 
reported nausea and her flagyl and ciprofloxacin were 
discontinued and the nausea resolved.  She slowly advanced from 
clears to a regular diet.  The ostomy nurse was consulted and 
provided instruction and supervision in the management of her 
ostomy.  Her ostomy was functioning well with stool and gas 
output.

Vital signs have been stable and she has been afebrile.  She has 
tolerated a regular diet. Her white blood cell count has 
normalized at 6.3 and her hematocrit at 31.7. Her pain is well 
controlled with an oral pain regimen and she is out of bed 
ambulating independently.

She is preparing for discharge home with follow-up scheduled 
with her PCP ___ ___ to follow her INR and scheduled follow 
up in in ___ clinic on ___.
