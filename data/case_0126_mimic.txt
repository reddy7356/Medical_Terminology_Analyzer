2. Right lateral pleural thickening versus a trace right pleural 
effusion. 
 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ with PMHx significant for major depressive disorder, PTSD, 
and alcohol abuse, presenting for ingestion of hand sanitizer at 
his group home.

# Isopropyl alcohol ingestion/Alcohol abuse/Suicidal Ideations: 
Patient reports drinking 3x20oz hand sanitizer (isopropyl 
alcohol) over the course of 3 days PTA. On admission, he was 
hemodynamically stable. Patient was difficult to arouse with 
significantly unintelligible, slurred speech, but was endorsing 
suicidal ideations. Patient had no electrolyte abnormalities on 
admission, and anion and osmolar gap were within normal limits 
and remained so throughout his stay. EKG remained unchanged. 
Patient recovered from his intoxication and was admitted under 
___ with a 1:1 sitter. There was some concern for 
continued altered mental status, and Wernicke's encephalopathy, 
so the patient was started on high-dose thiamine 500mg IV TID, 
and ultimately there was lesser suspicion for ___'s 
encephalopathy in discussion with psychiatry such that he was 
felt to be safe for transition to oral thiamine at discharge. 
His mental status improved shortly after being transferred to 
the floor and subsequently returned to normal. He remained 
severely depressed. He was placed on a CIWA scale, but was not 
scoring. He was connected with social work, who met with him and 
provided him with resources to participate in the PAATHS program 
at ___ (___), which is a walking clinic that 
can provide him with resources for treatment of alcohol abuse 
and help him find a shelter. He was provided with a cab voucher 
to go to ___ following discharge. Social work also gave him the 
contact information of the intake coordinator at "___ for 
Promise", a residential treatment program, who is awaiting his 
call for an informal assessment over the phone and possible 
placement. At discharge, the patient was not endorsing SI or HI, 
and was cleared by psychiatry and toxicology. He reports wanting 
to join a treatment program to help him with his recovery.

# Pneumonia:
Patient complained of a new cough on ___, with exam notable 
for minimal left basilar crackles. Patient afebrile, with normal 
oxygen saturation on room air. CXR was done and showed evidence 
of a left lower lobe infiltrate highly suggestive of pneumonia. 
Patient was started on a 7-day course of levofloxacin for 
treatment of pneumonia (7 days chosen versus 5 days, given 
possible sinusitis, see below). QTc was stable at discharge.

# Acute on Chronic Sinusitis:
On admission, head CT showed evidence of interval progression of 
paranasal sinus disease concerning for acute and chronic 
sinusitis. Patient also reports several episodes of epistaxis on 
___ and ___, likely in the setting of thrombocytopenia. 
Reports no recent trauma or rhinotillexis. Given concomitant 
pneumonia, plan was to extend course from 5 days to 7 days to 
cover possible bacterial sinusitis.

# Thrombocytopenia: 
Patient found to have a platelet count of ~ 100k. Possibly 
related to marrow suppression due to alcohol abuse. No evidence 
of significant liver disease on recent CT abdomen/pelvis to 
explain thrombocytopenia. Basic work-up, including HCV Ab and 
HIV Ab, unrevealing. Platelet count remained stable. Plan to 
follow-up with repeat CBC as outpatient and evaluation by PCP.

# Depression: 
Patient with a known history of anxiety and MDD currently on 
treatment with citalopram and trazodone. Medications initially 
held at the time of admission given toxic ingestion, but 
subsequently restarted following clearance from toxicology and 
psychiatry.

# Pain management: 
Patient previously evaluated in the ED for left-sided rib 
fracture and was reporting severe pain. Pain was adequately 
managed with standing acetaminophen (<2g/day) and lidocaine 
patch.

# Elevated Creatinine: 
Patient had an elevation in creatinine to 1.2, up form his 
baseline of 0.6-0.9. FENa of 2.7%, however, no evidence 
supporting ATN, AIN, or an underlying glomerulonephritis. Plan 
is for outpatient follow-up with PCP.

# Concern for STIs: 
Patient is not currently sexually active, but requested STI 
testing. He does not report any genital rashes, ulcers, or 
discharge. HIV and HCV serologies done and were negative. 

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
====================
# Patient was found to have a left lower lobe pneumonia and was 
started on a course of levofloxacin 750 mg for 7 days (last day 
___

baseline of 0.6-0.9. Requires follow-up within ___ weeks.
