Brief Hospital Course:
This is a ___ year old male with a past medical history of 
coronary artery disease (s/p RCA stent), ascending aortic 
aneurysm (s/p repair), who was transferred here with a right 
femoral IT fracture (had TFN on ___ and right olecranon 
fracture (closed management) after a fall.

The patient presented to the emergency department and was 
evaluated by the orthopedic surgery team. The patient was found 
to have a right intertrochanteric hip fracture and a 
nondisplaced right olecranon fracture and was admitted to the 
orthopedic surgery service. The patient was taken to the 
operating room on ___ for open reduction internal fixation 
of right hip fracture with TFN, which the patient tolerated 
well. For full details of the procedure please see the 
separately dictated operative report. The patient was taken from 
the OR to the PACU in stable condition and after satisfactory 
recovery from anesthesia was transferred to the floor. The 
patient was initially given IV fluids and IV pain medications, 
and progressed to a regular diet and oral medications by POD#1. 
The patient was given ___ antibiotics and 
anticoagulation per routine. The patient's home medications were 
continued throughout this hospitalization. The patient worked 
with ___ who determined that discharge to rehab was appropriate. 
He was noted to thrombocytopenic and his lovenox was held when 
his platelets were < 50. On ___, patient's stool was guiac 
positive with a hematocrit of 24.6. He was transferred to the 
medicine service for somnolence and hypoactive delirium. His 
mental status waxed and waned from A+Ox3 and able to say days of 
week backwards to being somnolent and only able to arouse with 
pain. His vitals were always stable at this time. He had a 
negative infectious work-up (CXR, urine culture, blood cultures 
without growth to date). He also had a CT head given his low 
platelets, but this showed no concerning intracranial 
abnormality and no concern for hemorrhage. For the fall that 
originally caused his fractures, he was on telemetry which 
showed normal sinus rhythm without evidence of 
bradycardia/tachyarrhythmia. He had negative orthostatics and a 
normal neurological exam. It was thought that his fall was 
likely secondary to either orthostatic hypotension (he has a 
history of this) or vasovagal (he was going to the bathroom at 
the time).

At the time of discharge the patient's pain was well controlled 
with oral medications, incisions were clean/dry/intact, and the 
patient was voiding/moving bowels spontaneously. The patient is 
weight-bearing as tolerated in the right lower extremity and 
right upper extremity, and will be discharged on lovenox for DVT 
prophylaxis. The patient will follow up with Dr. ___ 
routine. A thorough discussion was had with the patient 
regarding the diagnosis and expected post-discharge course 
including reasons to call the office or return to the hospital, 
and all questions were answered. The patient was also given 
written instructions concerning precautionary instructions and 
the appropriate follow-up care. The patient expressed readiness 
for discharge.

#Delirium: 
He had hypoactive delirium post-operatively. This was most 
likely secondary to post-the operation and anesthesia. His CXR 
(___) was negative for PNA, UA neg for infxn process, UCx 
negative/BCx without growth to date. His electroltes/LFTs/TSH 
were unremarkable and his EKG was largely unchanged. He did 
appear dry on exam, though labs were not consistent wfor 
hypovolemia apart from a mildly elevated BUN. He had a CTHNC 
(___) without evidence of intracranial abnormality.
 
#Hypertension:
His BP has been intermittently in 170s/60s. He is on atenolol at 
home (atenolol 50 mg qd and 25 mg qhs) and has been on quinapril 
in the past. However, his PCP took him off of this due to his 
history of orthostatic hypotension. He was continued on his home 
atenolol.

#Fall: 
The differential for his fall would include orthostatic 
hypotension given his self-reported history vs. a syncopal 
event, given that he presented with a report of presyncopal 
symptoms. His EKG shows NSR. His CTHNC (___) was without 
evidence of intracranial abnormality and telemetry (48 hours) 
was negative for arrhythmia.

#Leukopenia:
His WBC was 2.5 on ___. Differential included infection vs. 
malignancy since he is now pancytopenic (although he has other 
reasons for anemia). His WBC was uptrending upon discharge.

#Coronary artery disease: 
Patient has a history of coronary artery disease with history of 
PCI (RCA) and AAA repair (___). During this hospitalization, he 
was without chest pain or findings concerning for underlying 
cardiac etiology of this fall. He was continued on his home 
atenolol and crestor. 
 
#Anemia: 
His admission H/H was 9.2/28.9, slowly downtrending. He received 
2 uPRBC post-operatively. This was thought to be likely related 
to post operative blood loss, but was also guaiac positive on 
___ and has history of GIB. His hemoglobin remained stable ___ 
upon discharge.

#Thrombocytopenia: 
Acute-on-chronic thrombocytopenia is slightly worse than prior, 
now with platelets in the ___, from a recent baseline around 
50 but with a more remote baseline in the 100s (___). 
Kappa/lambda ratio normal. His platelets improved to ___ upon 
discharge.
