FINDINGS:
ADDITIONAL FINDINGS: ___ 15:35. TEE not feasible without 
conscious sedation. Risks,

Brief Hospital Course:
She was admitted and underwent cardiac cath today which revealed 
clean coronaries. The remainder of her preoperative evaluation 
was unremarkable and she was cleared for surgery. On ___, Dr. ___ an aortic valve replacement. For 
surgical details, please see operative note. Overall the patient 
tolerated the procedure well and post-operatively was 
transferred to the CVICU in stable condition for recovery and 
invasive monitoring. POD 1 found the patient extubated, alert 
and oriented and breathing comfortably.  The patient was 
neurologically intact and hemodynamically stable.  Beta blocker 
was initiated and the patient was gently diuresed toward the 
preoperative weight. 
She developed CHB and EP consulted. Planned for PPM- just prior, 
pt returned to ___.  Coumadin initiated and INR rose quickly. INR 
was allowed to trend down and heparin initiated.
The patient was transferred to the telemetry floor for further 
recovery. Chest tubes and pacing wires were discontinued without 
complication. EP continued to follow. EP study performed on ___ 
and revealed no need for PPM. She was continued on Coumadin with 
Heparin bridge until INR >2.0. 
The patient was evaluated by the Physical Therapy service for 
assistance with strength and mobility. By the time of discharge 
on POD 14 the patient was ambulating freely, the wound was 
healing and pain was controlled with oral analgesics.  The 
patient was discharged back to her group home with ___ services 
in good condition with appropriate follow up instructions. 
Per psych, she was taking oral naltrexone 50 mg PO daily (per 
group home records), rather than the higher dose long-acting 
formulation, Vivitrol. Regarding reinitiation, if it is thought 
that it is unlikely she'll need any opioids in the short term, 
it is reasonable to reintroduce oral naltrexone 50 mg PO daily 
in anticipation of the transition of care. If there is any 
possibility she may need opioids for acute pain control, would 
hold off and defer to outpatient prescriber after discharge.
