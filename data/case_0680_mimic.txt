=======================
Radiology:
========================
Radiology: 
___ CT Cystogram pelv W/CO- IMPRESSION:  1.  Moderate
urinary bladder distention with intracystic contrast material,
subsequently demonstrating no extraluminal extravasation to
suggest bladder rupture. 2.  Mildly displaced acute fracture
through the left superior pubic ramus, with a chronic deformity
involving the left inferior pubic ramus. 3.  Diverticulosis and
moderate atherosclerotic disease. 

___ Hip with pelvis (unilat 2 views)- IMPRESSION: Acute
fracture of the left symphysis pubis better assessed on same-day
CT. Left sacral fracture better assessed on same-day CT.  No
additional fracture 
seen. 
 
Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ is an ___ yo F with atrial fibrillation on apixiban 
admitted to the Acute Care Trauma Surgery Service from an 
outside hospital after a reportedly mechanical fall from 
standing. At outside hospital she was noted to have new 
hematuria. Imaging showed an acute left superior pubic ramus 
fracture and a chronic left inferior pubic ramus deformity. She 
was noted to have gross hematuria in foley catheter and urine 
culture positive for ciprofloxacin susceptible klebsiela 
pneumonia. CT scan of the head, neck, and torso were negative 
for acute injuries. Foley catheter was placed and patient 
underwent CT cystogram to further evaluate hematuria. CT 
cystogram showed moderate urinary bladder distention and no 
extraluminal extravasation suggestive of bladder rupture. Her 
apixiban was held, she was made NPO and admitted to the floor 
for further monitoring. 

Orthopedic surgery was consulted and determined her acute pubic 
fracture to be stable and a non-operative injury. 

The remainder of the hospital course is described below:

N: Her mental status wax and waned with best exam during the day 
and confusion/agitation/hallucinations in the evening. This is 
her baseline mental status confirmed by daughter exacerbated by 
hospitalization and narcotics. Pain was controlled with 
scheduled Tylenol and oxycodone for breakthrough. Narcotics were 
minimized in setting of chronic constipation.
CV: The patient remained stable from a cardiovascular 
standpoint; vital signs were routinely monitored.
Pulmonary: The patient remained stable from a pulmonary 
standpoint. Good pulmonary toilet, early ambulation and 
incentive spirometry were encouraged throughout hospitalization. 

GI/GU/FEN: The patient was initially kept NPO with IV fluids. On 
HD2, her hematocrit remained stable and therefore, the diet was 
advanced sequentially to a Regular diet, which was well 
tolerated. Patient's intake and output were closely monitored.
ID: The patient's fever curves were closely watched for signs of 
infection, of which there were none. The patient was treated for 
a urinary tract infection with ciprofloxacin for 3 days. 
Hematuria was monitored with foley catheter which improved 
gradually each day. The Medicine Team was consulted for 
hematuria and recommended restarting apixiban on HD4. On HD5 
urine remained light pink/clear without clots and catheter was 
removed. The patient was subsequently was able to void 
spontaneously.
HEME: The patient's blood counts were closely watched for signs 
of bleeding, of which there were none.
Prophylaxis: The patient received subcutaneous heparin and ___ 
dyne boots were used during this stay and was encouraged to get 
up and ambulate as early as possible. On HD4 home dose Eliquis 
was restarted with a stable hematocrit.

The patient is follow by rheumatology for temporal arteritis and 
on methotrexate and prednisone. Plan to continue current regimen 
until follow up with rheumatologist Dr. ___. 

At the time of discharge, the patient was doing well, afebrile 
and hemodynamically stable. The patient was tolerating a diet, 
voiding adequate pink tinged urine, and pain was well 
controlled.  The patient and daughter received discharge 
teaching and follow-up instructions with understanding 
verbalized and agreement with the discharge plan. It is 
recommended that the patient follow up with outpatient urology 
to ensure hematuria is resolved. 

Of note, patient arrived with MOLST form in chart designating 
DNR/DNI status.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,

You were admitted to the Acute Care Trauma Surgery Service on 
___ after a fall. You were found to have a fracture on your 
left hip. You were seen by the orthopedic surgery doctors and 
the ___ is stable which means it does not require surgery 
and will continue to heel on it's own. You had a urine sample 
sent that showed an infection in the bladder. You were given IV 
antibiotics to treat this. You also had a foley catheter placed 
which showed a large amount of blood in the urine. A CT of your 
bladder and urinary tract system was preformed and showed no 
acute injury. The blood in your urine decreased over the course 
of several days. The foley catheter was removed and you were 
able to urinate on your own. 

The medical team was consulted regarding the blood in your urine 
and recommended outpatient follow up with urology after 
discharge from rehab to make sure the blood is resolved.
