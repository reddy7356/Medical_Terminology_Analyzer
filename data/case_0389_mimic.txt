History of Present Illness:
Patient for evaluation of his
back and left leg pain that goes down in the L5 distribution 
into
his lateral calf, lateral thigh as well as into his Achilles and
the onset of his foot.  He has had three surgeries by Dr. ___ 
___
two by Dr. ___ involved removal of the inferior aspect
of L4 as well L5.  He had great relief from those surgeries.  
His
symptoms returned.  He has undergone physical therapy and
injections, which helped for about one week.  Walking and
sleeping on his side and sitting make it worse.  He has seen Dr.
___ recently for evaluation for surgical intervention. 
Recommendation was a L4-S1 posterior fusion with T11.

Past Medical History:  Heart disease, chest pain once with calf,
but no significant findings.  He has ___ esophagus.

Surgical History:  Appendectomy, exploratory laparotomy for
fistula repair, Z-plasty and scar revision.  Multiple back
surgeries, laparoscopic cholecystectomy.

Medications:  Include albuterol, amitriptyline, bupropion,
diazepam, fluticasone, hydroxyzine, lisinopril, and omeprazole.

Allergies:  Codeine, Compazine, fentanyl, oxycodone, and 
Vicodin.

An MRI of his lumbar spine was done on ___, which showed
degenerative changes at L4-L5 and L5-S1 with epidural fibrosis
and severe compression in the foramen as well as spinal recess 
of
the L5 nerve root.

Dr. ___ was reviewed.

On physical examination, a healthy-appearing male.  Affect is
within normal limits.  Gait is antalgic on the left side.  His
incision is clean, dry, and intact.  His abdomen has multiple
incisions with significant amount of scarring.  He has a 
positive
straight leg raise on the left side, not on the right.  No pain
with internal rotation of hips.  Physical exam is otherwise
within normal limits.

In summary, this is a patient with significant back as well as
leg pain with severe foraminal stenosis at L5.  Given his 
overall
presentation, I agree with Dr. ___ of L4-S1 revision
decompression and stabilization, particularly noted to 
decompress
the bilateral L5 nerve roots.  TLIF was performed with iliac
crest bone graft.  Risks and benefits of all of this were
discussed with him.  He is well aware at this time given his
multiple consultations for this.  He has looked on the Internet
and understands different types of instrumentation etc.  
However,
this is still explained by me using the models and films today. 
We talked about reasonable expectations postoperatively.  He has
a very labor intensive job.

Brief Hospital Course:
Patient was admitted to the ___ Spine Surgery Service and 
taken to the Operating Room for the above procedure.  Refer to 
the dictated operative note for further details.  The surgery 
was without complication and the patient was transferred to the 
PACU in a stable condition.  TEDs/pnemoboots were used for 
postoperative DVT prophylaxis.  Intravenous antibiotics were 
continued for 24hrs postop per standard protocol.

Post op he had itching, including itching of his dressing and 
incision and on POD#3 his incision began to open up on the most 
superior aspect with drainage.  He was then taken to the OR for 
I&D and plastic closure.  The surgery was without complication 
and the patient was transferred to the PACU in a stable 
condition.  TEDs/pnemoboots were used for postoperative DVT 
prophylaxis.

Intraop cultures were taken and are negative as of the day of 
discharge.

Physical therapy was consulted for mobilization OOB to ambulate. 
 Hospital course was otherwise unremarkable.  On the day of 
discharge the patient was afebrile with stable vital signs, 
comfortable on oral pain control and tolerating a regular diet.

IMAGING:
___ CT L Spine w contrast
IMPRESSION:
 
1.  Status post anterior and posterior instrumented fusion of L4 
through S1
without evidence of hardware related complications.
 
2.  Fluid collection within the posterior subcutaneous tissues 
at L3-L5,
extending into the laminectomy beds; its relationship to the 
thecal sac cannot
be determined due hardware-related artifacts.  Another, smaller 
fluid
collection abuts the superior posterior aspect of the left L4 
pedicle screw
and the top of the left posterio fusion rod and surrounds the 
left L3-4 facet
joint. These collections do not have completes rim of 
enhancement and may
represent post-surgical seromas, but superimposed infection 
cannot be excluded
by imaging.
 
3.  Neural foraminal narrowing at the L4-5 and L5-S1 levels, 
which could be
better evaluated with MRI. 

___ Lower extremity duplex bilateral
IMPRESSION:
 
No evidence of deep vein thrombosis in either leg.

___ CXR
IMPRESSION:
 
No acute cardiopulmonary process.

 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ with a history of HIV (last CD4 count 475 in ___ and 
lumbar disc disease s/p lumbar fusion on ___ c/b wound 
dehiscence with plastics closure ___ now presenting with fever 
to 102.  

# Fever: 
-Patient presented with fever to 102 and rigors in the context 
of recent surgery. The fever had an unclear etiology as patient 
had no clear urinary, pulmonary, or abdominal source and no 
leukocytosis. Given recent surgery, the greatest concern was for 
surgical site infection but the incision looked clean and 
without obvious superficial infection, in addition to reduced JP 
drain output and negative intraop cx from ___. A deeper 
infection or hardware infection was possible as ESR/CRP were 
both elevated. Ortho and plastics recommended vancomycin in 
house, which was started, and Bactrim on discharge for total ___lood cx were drawn in the ED which are pending on 
day of discharge. Patient was transitioned on HD2 to Bactrim but 
switched to clindamycin on day of discharge due to new 
leukopenia.  Per ortho,  MRI would not be beneficial so close to 
surgery, so CT with contrast of lumbar spine was obtained 
showing fluid collections around surgical site seromas vs 
infection. Per ortho these fluid collections are consistent with 
typical post-surgical findings and not concerning for infection. 
CRP improved over the course of admission and patient was 
afebrile throughout admission. He never appeared toxic. Patient 
was discharged on clindamycin with PCP, ___, and plastic 
follow up in one week.   

# S/p lumbar fusion on ___ c/b wound dehiscence with plastics 
closure ___  
- Ortho and plastics followed the patient throughout admission. 
They recommended leaving wound open to air  with JP drain in 
place until one week after discharge. The wound was clean, dry, 
and intact with mild swelling and erythema on admission which 
resolved by discharge. Pain management was managed with dilaudid 
within home dose ranges starting at 4mg q3h prn and increasing 
to 8mg in addition to 1000 mg tylenol TID and valium for spasm. 
Patient noted improvement in pain and mobility by time of 
discharge though he is still very limited in his activity and 
has significant pain with movement. He was seen by ___ who 
recommended home ___ and 24hr assistance. 

#Leg pain
-Patient complained of bilateral calf pain with mild swelling 
L>R and tenderness to palpation on admission. Bilateral lower 
extremity duplex ultrasounds were performed to r/o DVT 
especially in setting of hypercoaguability after recent 
orthopedic surgery. These studies were negative and pain 
resolved prior to discharge. 

#Leukopenia
-On day prior to admission WBC count drop from 9.8 to 3.0 over 
one day with concomitant 5 point Hct drop and 100K Plt count 
drop. He did not receive fluid so likely not dilutional, though 
in the context of recent surgery could have had fluid shifts. 
Bactrim had been started on the previous day and is the most 
likely offending agent. Dose was dropped from 2 tabs BID to 1 
tab BID. WBC dropped to 2.9 on day of discharge so Bactrim was 
discontinued and replaced with clindamycin. He will follow up 
with his PCP in one week for followup CBC. He was clinically 
stable during this time. 

# Constipation: 
- Patient not stooled for 5 days prior to admission but was able 
to move bowels after colace, senna, bisacodyl, polyethylene 
glycol. Discharged on colace, senna, and bisacodyl. 

# HIV:  
- Stable on atanazavir, truvada, ritonavir  

# HTN:  
- Lisinopril held borderline low BPs in 100s/70s, restarted on 
discharge.   

# Depression:  
- Stable on bupropion, paroxetine  

# GERD:  
- Stable on cont omeprazole, ranitidine

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___, 

You were admitted to ___ for 
fever and back pain in the setting of recent lumbar fusion 
surgery. You were started on vancomycin, an IV antibiotic, and 
switched to Bactrim (oral antibiotic) to cover possible 
infection of the surgical site. As your white blood cell counts 
fell after starting Bactrim, you were switched to clindamycin. 
CT scan of the surgical site showed fluid collections which were 
determined to be consistent with typical post-surgical changes. 
During your admission you had no further fevers or evidence of 
infection. 

You should take the clindamycin for another three days after 
discharge to cover for infection. Clindamycin can sometimes 
increase the likelihood of a gut infection called C. difficile, 
especially in patients who have been in the hospital. If you 
begin to have abdominal pain and frequent foul-smelling 
diarrhea, please call your PCP. 

You will be discharged with plans for home physical therapy to 
help you gain strength and prevent further injury to your back. 
Please make sure when you are turning in bed that you turn your 
legs first, then your upper body in order to reduce strain. 

You should follow up with with PCP in one week and have a 
complete blood count drawn to make sure your blood counts have 
recovered. You should also follow up in one week with 
orthopedics and plastic surgery for post-surgical care and JP 
drain removal. 

It has been a pleasure caring for you, 

Your ___ Doctors
