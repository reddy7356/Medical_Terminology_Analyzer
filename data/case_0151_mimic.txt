Pertinent Results:
CT/CTA: Large right frontotemporoparietal hemorrhage (4.4 x 2.4
cm) with surrounding edema, subfalcine herniation with left 
shift
of normally midline structures by 10 mm. Compression of right
lateral ventricle, evidence of early uncal herniation. CTA: No
aneurysm. Note detector malfunction occurred on CT console,
causing artifact on series 3, image 278-302. Final pending
reformats. Recommend contrast enhanced brain MR when patient
stabilized as part of workup for underlying mass.

Echo: The left atrium is mildly dilated. No atrial septal defect 
or patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline 
contrast with maneuvers. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity 
size and regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF 
70%). There is no ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular 
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve 
leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet 
excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve appears 
structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is 
no mitral valve prolapse. There is no pericardial effusion. 

Brain MR: PRELIMINARY REPORT:
 
IMPRESSION: Right temporal/parietal hematoma with adjacent mass 
effect, 
similar to the recent CT, without definite underlying mass. 
Continued follow up is suggested to exclude an underlying mass.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ is a ___ year old man with a history of hypertension
and migraines who presented to ___ today with
headache and visual changes for nearly 10 days.  CT scan has
identified a large right frontotemporalparietal hemorrhage with
significant edema and 10mm midline shift.  There is compression
of the right lateral ventricle and evidence of subfalcine and
early uncal herniation.  Remarkably, his initial exam was 
notable only for
an old right facial droop (hx of bells palsy), left pronator
drift, bilateral agraphesthesia, and left sided neglect to
simultaneous visual and tactile stimuli.  He was unsteady when
standing and leans to his right.  The cause of the bleed is
unclear.  The patient reported weight lifting prior to the onset
of symptoms and it is possible this was a hypertensive event, 
also since his verapamil had been self-discontinued.  

Mr. ___ was admitted to the neuro ICU, under the stroke 
attending, Dr. ___.  He was ruled out for a myocardial 
infarction.  He had a lipid profile which showed LDL 68, HDL 39, 
and HbA1C which was 5.8.  He was followed by neurosurgery.  He 
had a cardiac echo which showed no evidence of atrial septal 
defect or patent foramen ovale.  

Head/Neck CT/CTA showed:
 1. Right temporoparietal intraparenchymal hemorrhage with 
surrounding edema.  
Mass effect as described above. 
2. Normal CT angiography of the neck. 
3. CT angiography of the head demonstrates vascular 
displacement, but no 
evidence of aneurysm or abnormal vascular structures. No 
evidence of dural 
sinus thrombosis. 

Brain MRI/MRA showed stable hemorrhage and no clear evidence of 
underlying mass, though this inconclusive as a mass could be 
masked by blood.  Therefore, it is recommended that the brain 
MRI be repeated in 6 weeks time.

 
Medications on Admission:
(Verapamil:  was not taking)

hours) as needed for pain.
Disp:*5 Tablet(s)* Refills:*0*

 
Discharge Disposition:
Home
 
Discharge Diagnosis:
1. Right temporoparietal intraparenchymal hemorrhage with 
surrounding edema

 
Discharge Condition:
Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Level of Consciousness: Alert and interactive.
Activity Status: Ambulatory - Independent.

 
Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted to ___ after you were found to have a 
bleeding in your brain.  You were re-started on your blood 
pressure medication, Verapamil.  You had an echocardiogram of 
your heart which was normal.  The cause of your brain bleed is 
not entirely clear.  It may have been the result of high blood 
pressure. Your MRI did not show evidence of an underlying mass, 
but blood can mask this.  Therefore, we would like to repeat the 
MRI in 6 weeks. Please follow up with Dr. ___ as directed 
below after you have this MRI.

You may take tylenol for your headache.  For severe headache or 
breakthrough pain, you may take oxycodone.  However, if you 
continue to have severe headache, worsening pain, or vomiting, 
please go to the nearest emergency room for evaluation.
 
Followup Instructions:
___
