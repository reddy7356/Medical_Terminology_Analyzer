Brief Hospital Course:
___ year-old man with a history of HTN, HLD, and intention tremor 
who presents with 3 falls followed by weakness over the last 2 
days and rapidly progressing skin erythema initially in his RLE, 
now spreading up his medial right thigh. 
.
# Cellulitis - The patient presented with warm, erythematous and 
tender RLE with leukocytosis.  There is a clear source of skin 
breakdown on pt's heal, which is likely source of infection.  Pt 
reported subjective fevers at home, decreased PO intake and 
several recent falls.  Pt remained afebrile during hospital 
course.  He was started on vancomycin and unasyn for double gram 
positive coverage.  Borders were marked and regressed with 
initiation of antibiotic therapy.  He remained afebrile and he 
was transitioned to PO Bactrim and Dicloxicillin for a 10 day 
antibiotic course.  
.
Rhabdomyolysis: On admission pt was found to have elevated 
creatinine at 1.6 and UA was positive for blood without red 
blood cells.  A CK was checked and was elevated at approximately 
___.  Prior to admission pt had decreased PO intake, likely 
from infection and also had several falls and leg weakness.  Pt 
was  treated with aggressive fluid resuscitation and his CK 
decreased appropriately.  His acute kidney injury improved and 
creatine returned to baseline.
.
# Falls/Confusion: Reported recent decreased PO intake and 
extreme leg weakness leading to his falls.  Most likely that his 
rhabdo led to feelings of muscle weakness.  He was monitored on 
tele and did not have any significant arrhythmogenic events.  
RPR, TSH and orthostatics were checked and all unremarkable.  A 
head CT was performed in ED and did not reveal any acute 
intracranial abnormality.  
. 

# HTN - Pt's HCTZ and lisinopril were held on admission because 
___ ___ rhabdo.  After aggressive fluid resuscitation and 
improvement of kidney function, pt remained normotensive so on 
discharge his antihypertensives were discontinued.  Restarting 
antihypertensive meds should be considered by PCP if 
hypertensive on follow up.  
.
# HLD - Pt was on lipitor and niacin on admission to hospital.  
These medications could have contributed to rhabdo and were held 
throughout hospitalization.  At time of discharge both niacin 
and lipitor were held given risk of reccurent rhabdo.  
Restarting statin and niacin will need to be discussed with PCP 
at outpatient followup.    
.
# GERD - Pt was continued on home dose of omeprazole.
Transitional
- follow up with PCP, likely does not need such agressive BP 
control, and niacin statin combo could have contributed to 
rhabdo.
.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Dr. ___,

___ was a pleasure taking care of you.  You were admitted to the 
hospital for falls and cellulitis.  We also discovered that you 
had rhabdomyolysis.  The etiology of rhabdomyolysis was likely 
multifactorial and secondary to dehydration/hypovolemia in 
setting of statin and niacin use as well as hypokalemia on 
admission.  We treated you with IV hydration and your kidney 
function returned to baseline and your CK blood levels trended 
down indicating that the rhabdo had resolved.  

Your cellulitis was initially treated with IV antibiotics and 
improved.  We transitioned you to an oral antibiotic regimen to 
complete a ___nding on ___.

The following changes were made to your medications:
1. Stopped niacin and Lipitor as possibly contributed to your 
rhabdomyolysis
2. Holding your lisinopril and HCTZ as your blood pressures 
normalized without these medications.  Please discuss restarting 
these with your PCP.
3. Started Bactrim and Dicloxicillin for your cellulitis, please 
complete a 10 day course to end on ___
 
Followup Instructions:
___
