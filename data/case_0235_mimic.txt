IMAGING
====================

___ CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST
IMPRESSION: 
1. No acute intracranial process within limitations of this 
noncontrast study. No evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage. 

2. Multiple ground-glass lytic calvarial lesions likely 
attributable to known multiple myeloma. 

___ TTE
CONCLUSION:
The left atrial volume index is SEVERELY increased. The right 
atrium is mildly enlarged. There is normal left ventricular wall 
thickness with a normal cavity size. There is normal regional 
and global left ventricular systolic function. Quantitative 
biplane left ventricular ejection fraction is 65 % (normal 
54-73%). There is no resting left ventricular outflow tract 
gradient. Mildly dilated right ventricular cavity with normal 
free wall motion. Tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion 
(TAPSE) is normal. The aortic sinus diameter is normal for 
gender with normal ascending aorta diameter for gender. The 
aortic arch diameter is normal with a normal
descending aorta diameter. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are 
mildly thickened. There is no aortic valve stenosis. There is 
trace aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets appear 
structurally normal with no mitral valve prolapse. There is mild 
[1+] mitral regurgitation. The pulmonic valve leaflets are 
normal. The tricuspid valve leaflets appear structurally normal. 
There is physiologic tricuspid regurgitation. There is mild 
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial 
effusion. IMPRESSION: preserved biventricular systolic function; 
mild pulmonary hypertension
   
___ CHEST (PORTABLE AP)     
IMPRESSION: 
1. No evidence of pneumothorax. 
2. Otherwise, no interval change. 
          
___ SKELETAL SURVEY 
There are lytic lesions within the calvarium, possibly within 
the left T11 pedicle, humeri, pelvis and femora, suspicious for 
multiple myeloma. There is no pathologic fracture. 

PATHOLOGY
====================
___ Cytogenetics, Blood
FISH: POSITIVE for GAIN of 1q, MONOSOMY 13, IGH REARRANGEMENT, 
and MYC
REARRANGEMENT. Numerous interphase peripheral blood cells 
examined after enrichment by magnetic separation had abnormal 
probe signal patterns consistent with an extra copy of 1q, 
monosomy 13, an IGH gene rearrangement, and rearrangement of the 
MYC gene. There was no evidence of deletion of the TP53 gene or 
gain of chromosomes 5, 9 and 15 and a concurrent FISH study has 
excluded the IGH/CCND1 rearrangement (see below). Approximately 
35% of the cells had probe signal patterns consistent with a 
doubled tetraploid form of the abnormal chromosome
complement that harbors these findings.

___ Bone Marrow Biopsy
SPECIMEN: PERIPHERAL BLOOD SMEAR, BONE MARROW ASPIRATE AND CORE 
BIOPSY
DIAGNOSIS: HYPERCELLULAR BONE MARROW WITH MATURING TRILINEAGE 
HEMATOPOIESIS AND INVOLVEMENT BY THE PATIENT'S KNOWN PLASMA CELL 
NEOPLASM; SEE NOTE. Note: CD___ immunohistochemistry highlights 
diffusely distributed plasma cells averaging 90% of the total 
cellularity. Plasma cells are restricted by lambda immunostain. 
Concurrent cytogenetic studies revealed gain of 1q, monosomy 13, 
IGH gene rearrangement, and C-MYC gene earrangement. The 
constellation of morphologic and cytogenetic changes portends an 
aggressive clinical course.

 
Brief Hospital Course:
===================
SUMMARY:
===================
___ female with 2-month history of fatigue, shortness of 
breath, and 40 pound weight loss found with new diagnosis of IgG 
lambda multiple myeloma, R-ISS Stage III. She received 4-day 
dexamethasone and 3 doses of bortezomib before discharge with 
good effect. Plan for outpatient follow-up and continuation of 
treatment.  

====================
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
====================
#MM
[ ] Plan for lenalidomide as outpatient for MM
[ ] Start bisphosphonates after tumor debulking for hyperCa
[ ] Please note pt does not want family or workplace to know 
diagnosis, continue engaging with SW

#HTN/Cardiovascular
[ ] Optimize SBPs. Consider workup for 2ndary HTN given 
uncontrolled on 4 medications
[ ] Recheck Cr at ___ visit to ensure stability after restart 
of ACEi
[ ] Restart aspirin 81mg when finished with chemotherapy and no 
longer thrombocytopenic
[ ] Readdress diabetes management (A1c 5.6% ___ after 
losing significant amount of weight with disease
[ ] Consider holding atenolol given low heart rates; HR high ___ 
to ___ on this admission

[ ] Recheck LFTs one week after discharge. Were slightly 
elevated before discharge.

======================
ACUTE MEDICAL ISSUES:
======================
# Multiple myeloma, IgG lambda, R-ISS Stage III, +1q (8;14):
Presented with 2 months of fatigue, dyspnea, and 40-pound weight 
loss, found with new anemia and thrombocytopenia, hyperCa, 
elevated Cr, transferred from ___ for further workup. Lab 
abnormalities together with multiple calvarial bone lytic 
lesions on CT concerning for multiple myeloma, which was 
confirmed on ___ BMBx (packed marrow with circulating plasma 
cells ~2%). Cytogenetics revealed +1q, monosomy 13, IGH/MYC 
rearrangement [t(8;14)(q24;q32)]. SPEP and IFE with monoclonal 
IgG lambda, and UPEP showed monoclonal IgG lambda with BJP 150 
mg/day. K/L ratio 0.02. R-ISS Stage III (40% overall survival 
rate, 29mo median progression-free survival). Skeletal survey 
___ showed diffuse lytic lesions. She received 4-day 
dexamethasone 40mg IV and was initiated on three doses of 
bortezomib, starting ___, with plan for lenalidomide as 
outpatient. There was no evidence of TLS or DIC, and the patient 
remained asymptomatic throughout. Uric acid downtrended from 
12.7 with fluids; G6PD negative, but rasburicase was not given. 
Calcium downtrended from 11.8, and kidney function improved from 
creatinine 1.1 to 0.6 at discharge. She will start 
bisphosphonates as outpatient after tumor debulking for 
hypercalcemia and multiple lytic lesions. She received acyclovir 
400mg BID for infectious prophylaxis, as well as mIVF and 
allopurinol for TLS prophylaxis. In total, she received 3U pRBC 
during her admission and 1U platelets at discharge. Of note, pt 
expressed that she does not want family or her workplace to know 
her diagnosis; Social Work was heavily involved this admission.

# ___:
Creatinine peaked at 1.1, baseline 0.9. Likely prerenal and with 
contribution from multiple myeloma. Her kidney function improved 
with fluids and blood products. Her thiazide and ACE inhibitor 
were restarted at discharge. Her discharge creatinine was 0.6. 
Can recheck Cr at next Oncology apt ___.

# SOB:
Likely due to volume overload. Patient endorsed orthopnea and 
exam with noticeable systolic murmur radiating to carotids, but 
no valvular abnormalities or reduced EF on TTE. TTE also showed 
mild pulmonary hypertension with severely dilated RA likely in 
setting of acute volume overload. Negative trops on admission. 
ECG showing RBBB and LVH. Her dyspnea resolved prior to 
discharge.

# Sinus bradycardia:
HR ___. Asymptomatic. Appears to be chronic, and atenolol 
was held a few doses with HR still < 50. She will be discharged 
to continue her home atenolol given her uncontrolled 
hypertension, but optimal blood pressure and heart rate 
medications should be addressed as outpatient.

======================
CHRONIC MEDICAL ISSUES:
======================

# HTN: 
BP was elevated 158-195/70-80s in ED, SBPs largely in 170s 
during hospitalization. Continued home amlodipine 10mg and 
atenolol 100mg. Home HCTZ 25mg held initially in setting of 
elevated uric acid, and resumed before discharge. Her home 
lisinopril 40mg was held in setting of ___, restarted at 
discharge. For SBP > 185, she was given hydralazine 10mg PRN. 
ECG showed LVH. TTE with normal LV wall thickness. Would 
consider outpatient workup for secondary causes of hypertension 
given on 4 BP meds. 

# Hyperlipidemia:
Continued home atorvastatin 80mg.

# T2DM:
She has a history of diabetes on home metformin 500mg BID which 
was stopped upon admission. However, in the setting of her 
significant weight loss, she required minimal to no insulin in 
the hospital. A1c was 5.6% this admission. Continued to hold 
metformin on discharge. Re-evaluate need for DM mgmt. as an 
outpatient.

thickened leaflets. Compared with the prior TTE (images 
reviewed)
of ___, the severity of mitral regurgitation
and estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure are now
increased.

CTA CHEST ___: No evidence of pulmonary embolism to the
segmental level. Ground-glass opacities within the right lower
lobe, adjacent to the pleural effusion, likely reflecting
atelectasis, although underlying infection cannot definitively 
be
excluded. Small bilateral pleural effusions. Mildly dilated main
pulmonary artery, which can be seen in the setting of 
pulmonary hypertension. Diffusely heterogeneous bones, with a
lytic lesion within the sternal manubrium measuring 2.5 cm,
compatible with known multiple myeloma. No evidence of acute
fracture.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ is a ___ female
with DMII, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and multiple myeloma on
RVD who presents with shortness of breath and lower extremity
swelling, found to have acute on chronic diastolic failure and
c/f pneumonia. 

ACUTE CONDITIONS
=======================

#ACUTE ON CHRONIC DIASTOLIC HEART FAILURE: On initial myeloma
workup/presentation, had SOB and BLE edema with noticeable
systolic murmur radiating to carotids. Ddx: aortic stenosis ___
systolic murmur) vs. anemia vs. heart failure (no history, no
cardiomegaly on CXR but does have BNP elevation and peripheral
edema) vs. pulmonary HTN of unknown etiology vs. pericardial
effusion (resolved per most TTE) in the setting of multiple
myeloma. ACS ruled out with negative troponin x2. ECG on this
showed RBBB and sinus bradycardia. In the setting of BLE edema
and SOB exacerbation, we invoked possibility of medication
related effects (? velcade ___ pulmonary HTN exacerbation; ?
amlodipine ___ worsening ___ edema, on hold). Less concern 
for
PE (though considerable risk with revlimid, no heart strain on
recent TTE). Recent ___ negative. TTE ___ showed mild
symmetric LVH with normal cavity size and regional/global
biventricular systolic function as well as moderate mitral
regurgitation, mild pulmonary artery systolic HTN and mild AR
with mildly thickened leaflets. At this juncture, we consulted
cardiology ___ who thinks that patient most likely has acute
on chronic diastolic heart failure and suspect hypertensive 
heart
disease to be the likely etiology; however, cardiac MRI could be
obtained if her heart failure is progressive and does not 
respond
to therapy (would also evaluate for amyloid). In the meantime, 
we
continued diuresis and changed HTN regimen as below.

Treatment plan
-Continue Carevdilol 25mg BID ___ (switched from atenolol)
-Continue Spironolactone 25mg now every other day as of ___
due to ___ as below
-On Lasix 40mg po every other day due to ___ as below
-Goal weight 170lb outpatient 
-Strict I/O
-Daily weights outpatient
-Compression stockings
-Low NA+ diet
-will need f/u cardiology outpatient (patient given number to
request appt)

#PRESUMED PNEUMONIA: Unclear etiology/organism. CTA Chest ___
was obtained in s/o disproportionate shortness of breath/dyspnea
on exertion in relation to anticipated response from aggressive
diuresis. Imaging ruled out PE but noted GGOs within RLL,
adjacent to pleural effusion, likely reflecting atelectasis,
although underlying infection cannot be excluded. In this
context, felt it was reasonable to cover her for community
acquired pneumonia with levofloxacin. However, also invoked
possibility of PJP pneumonia albeit no evidence of fulminant
respiratory failure, fever, dry cough or hypoxemia. She has had
LDH elevation since diagnosis that actually appears to be
improving. Of note, as she has not been on PJP prophylaxis, felt
that she was at considerable risk given steroid exposure so
favored PJP treatment with Bactrim pending further workup.

Treatment Plan
--------------------
-Bactrim DS (D1: ___. If fungal markers neg (specifically 
BD
glucan), will transition to SS Bactrim for prophylaxis, d/c home 
with DS Bactrim for now
-Initiated on Levofloxacin (D1: ___
-F/U fungal markers, strep A, legionella
-Consider pulmonary consult and/or repeat imaging if SOB worsens

#HYPERTENSIVE URGENCY: Asymptomatic, with some improvement.
Uptrending since admission, ___. Likely
exacerbated in the setting of acute illness and heart failure
exacerbation. Renal function is normal. Cardiology following and
helping to adjust regimen as appropriate.

Treatment Plan
-Continue lisinopril 40mg daily
-Switched atenolol to carvedilol 25mg BID
-Added spironolactone 25mg every other day and hydralazine 10mg
TID and prn
-added back low dose amlodipine (2.5mg daily) 
-cards outpatient

___: improved. Cr increase to 1.1 with BUN 14 ___ from
baseline Cr 0.6-0.7 and BUN ___. likely secondary to cardiac
medications/diuretics.
-changed spironolactone and Lasix to every other day as above
-adjust cardiac medications prn

#MULTIPLE MYELOMA, IgG lambda: High risk disease by R-IPSS she
has elevated LDH and beta2microglobulin (stage 3) and by FISH 
she
has 1q gain (high risk) and IGH/myc rearrangement. Overall, plan
to proceed towards ASCT if achieves good response w/ induction.
Now status post 3C of RVD (though D11 of C3 held in s/o heart
failure exacerbation)
-Hold RVD for now
-Continue acyclovir 400mg BID, refer above regarding PJP ppx
-Continue home ASA for VTE ppx
-Protein/Cr ratio, okay; UPEP PND

CHRONIC/STABLE/RESOLVED CONDITIONS

#HYPOKALEMIA: Likely due to aggressive diuresis, repleting
accordingly. Trend electrolytes BID. 

#SINUS BRADYCARDIA: HR ___ intermittently. Asymptomatic.
