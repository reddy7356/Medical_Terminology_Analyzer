Brief Hospital Course:
PSYCHIATRIC
# SI: In the ED, pt reported plan to hang himself with a rope. 
During inpatient stay, pt denied SI/intent/plan. Possible 
precipitants include a break-up with his boyfriend -- who he 
reported was physically abusive to him -- and fight between his 
mother and stepfather, which worried him for his mother's sake. 
He declined to let team call family. Pt was future orientated at 
time of discharge with goal to train as a ___ (Workplace on 
___) and obtain work in the area. 
During his stay on the inpatient unit, the pt never exhibited 
any self-injurious activities and was safe.  He attended groups 
and especially noted enjoying the spa group.  He was able to 
tolerate ___ d/w staff about how his drug use contributed to the 
SI he presented with, and he agreed to sobriety.  

# COCAINE INDUCED PSYCHOSIS
The pt presented with cocaine and MJ intake and subsequent 
psychosis and SI. 

Pt had the following psychotic symptoms on admission:
-AH telling him to hurt someone which were egodystonic (pt 
recognized this was dangerous and asked to end the meeting so he 
could be in a larger room) - he had no intent or plan to act on 
distressing voices
-parnaoia - feels like people might be after him (reported 
recent discourse with sister whom he had paranoid thoughts 
about)
-thought blocking
-selective mutism

Home seroquel 100 mg qam was continued and titrated to 100 mg 
qam and 200 mg qhs. 
The psychotic symptoms resolved after ___ days during which time 
he underwent cocaine withdrawal and stayed in bed most of time 
except to eat. Afterwards, pt was noted to have organized, 
future orientated thinking with no delusions or paranoia. Pt 
reported that seroquel was helpful, which was continued (100 mg 
BID) to help with sleep and mood although pt appears to have a 
primary substance abuse d/o. 

Although we used the neuroleptic in the hospital to help with 
the above target sx and initial distress, we would recommend 
that patient be tapered off seroquel as outpatient as he does 
not have a primary psychotic disorder.  His sx completely 
alleviated after ___ indicating that he likely suffered from 
cocaine intoxication problems and not primary psychosis.  

Pt was informed of his diagnosis and told that we did not 
believe he had schizophrenia. Pt stated that he did have 
schizophrenia and endorsed multiple atypical sx including
-that he hears multiple voices (he could not identify whether 
male or female or recognize the voices) 
-that yell at him all the time and nothing makes them better or 
worse. 
-He also endorsed seeing people in odd colors. 
It is possible that patient maybe expressing psychotic symptoms 
for secondary gain. Specifically, housing, as he is new to 
___ and we rec'd collateral information that he has had over 
6 hospitalizations (including this one) since ___.

Pt receives mental health care at ___ and ___ 
___
and had a follow up appointment with Dr. ___ at ___ 
___. Pt agreed to attend a dual diagnosis partial program. 

# R/O DEPRESSION
Pt was continued on home medication of celexa 20 mg. On the 
unit, pt was observed to be full of energy and euthymic after 
symptoms of cocaine withdrawal resolved. Would recommend that 
patient be tapered off celexa as outpatient as he does not 
appear to be depressed. 

# COCAINE ABUSE: Pt was found to have a crack pipe in his 
belongings and tox screen was positive for cocaine. Pt was 
educated that doing cocaine can cause psychotic symptoms and 
that he should not do cocaine. Pt consitently denied abusing 
cocaine and stated that his marijuana must have been 
contanimated with cocaine. Per records obtained from ___ 
___, pt was doing cocaine at that time as well. He stated he 
would stop doing marijuana and did not need a support such as 
smart recover/AA to stop using marijuana. He was noted to be in 
the precontemplative stage for addiction recovery. Prior to 
discharge, pt did agree that NA with sponsor would help with 
attaining sobriety. He agreed to attend a NA meeting on day of 
discharge and to continue going to NA. He was ambivalent about 
obtaining a sponsor stating it is hard to "find the right one."

RISK ASSESSMENT
This patient is currently sober, behaving safely, and has a low 
imminent risk of self-harm at this time.

He does, however, have chronic high risk for self harm.  
Pt has the following static risk factors: young age, hx of 
trauma, gay
Pt has the following dynamic risk factors which the team 
intervened upon:
SI with plan - pt has stablized and future orientated at time of 
discharge
substance abuse - pt was safely detoxed and encouraged to f/u 
with NA and attain a sponsor. dual diagnosis partial program
gender identity conflict - follow up with treaters
homelessness - returning to shelter

Also, pt has a high risk of relapsing into a psychotic episode 
in the future due to his lack of insight into need for sobriety. 
Pt has been educated about this risk and our recommendations to 
abstain from drugs.
 
During the hospitalization, pt did not engage in any 
self-injurious behaviors and he did not behave dangerously 
toward others.  At the time of discharge, he was not 
suicidal/homicidal, and she was meeting his basic needs for 
ordinary life.  Therefore, at this time, the least restrictive 
setting for care is outpatient.
