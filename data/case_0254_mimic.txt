Brief Hospital Course:
___ yo M PMHx Afib (on warfarin), HTN, HLD, hemorrhoids, 
diverticulosis, and stroke who presented with bright red blood 
per rectum.

ACUTE/ACTIVE PROBLEMS:
# Rectal bleeding: 
Patient reported constipation, hard stools, and needing to use 
an enema at home prior to admission.  Rectal bleeding started 
after using the enema at home.  His hemoglobin at admission was 
12.5 (last checked in ___ at 15.6).  He was given 
vitamin K.  GI was consulted.  His hemoglobin remained stable 
throughout his hospitalization (discharge value 13.6) and he had 
no further episodes of bleeding.  He had a recent colonoscopy ___ 
years ago) putting malignancy lower on the differential.  After 
discussion with GI and further hemoglobin monitoring, the 
patient was not thought to require inpatient colonoscopy. The 
most likely etiology of the patient's rectal bleeding was 
hemorrhoidal vs. local trauma from enema. He was predisposed to 
bleed given INR elevated at 6 at time of admission.  He was 
encouraged to eat a high fiber diet, stay well hydrated, and 
start miralax daily.  He was encouraged to discuss outpatient 
colonoscopy with his PCP ___ ___ months.   

# Afib on warfarin
# Supratherapeutic INR: 
INR 6.3 at admission.  Given two doses of vitamin K.  INR 3 at 
discharge.  Given patient's stable Hb and resolution of 
bleeding, he was restarted on Coumadin.  He follows with the 
___ clinic.  He will have an INR check the day 
after discharge.

#Ear infection; 
Finishes course of amox-clav on ___. Continue 
Neomycin-Polymyxin ear drops

# BPH
Continue finasteride

# Allergic rhinitis
Continue Flonase

# HLD: continue pravastatin.
# Asthma: Continue daily prednisone. Not on albuterol inhaler as 
it doesn't help

Discharge Disposition:
Home With Service
 
Facility:
___
 
Discharge Diagnosis:
Hematochezia
Suspected hemorrhoidal bleeding

 
Discharge Condition:
Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Level of Consciousness: Alert and interactive.
Activity Status: Ambulatory - Independent.

 
Discharge Instructions:
You came to the hospital with bleeding from the rectum.  We 
suspect this bleeding was from a hemorrhoid.  Your blood counts 
remained stable and your bleeding resolved.  To reduce the risk 
of this type of bleeding before, please ensure you have soft 
bowel movements every day.  This can be accomplished by eating a 
high fiber diet, or taking stool softeners and laxatives as 
needed.

You were also found to have an elevated INR.  You were given 
vitamin K to reverse the INR.  Since your bleeding stopped and 
was mild, you are safe to resume your Coumadin.  This will need 
to be followed closely to ensure it does not get too high again 
in the future.

It was a pleasure taking care of you at ___!

EtOH abuse/dependence. 
 
Physical Exam:
On my physical examination, vital signs were 97.3, 72, 117/83,
18, 96%, ___ 85. In general, patient is awake, cooperative,
pleasant and in no apparent distress. He was well appearing,
jovial and appeared younger than his stated age. The patient had
a NCAT head without conjunctival icterus. Mucous membranes were
moist and oropharynx is clear of lesions. Poor dentition. Neck
was supple without masses or thyromegaly. Chest examination
revealed irregularly irregular heart sounds without murmurs, and
lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally. Belly was soft
without focal tenderness, and extremities were warm and well
perfused. Skin examination showed no rashes or lesions.  

Neurologically, the patient is awake, alert and oriented x 3.
Able to relate history without difficulty. Attentive, able to
name ___ backward without difficulty. Language is fluent with
intact repetition and comprehension. Normal prosody. There were
no paraphasic errors. Pt. was able to name both high and low
frequency objects. Able to read without difficulty. No anomia to
NIHSS objects. Speech was not dysarthric. Able to follow both
midline and appendicular commands. Pt. was able to register 3
objects and recall ___ at 5 minutes. The pt. had good knowledge
of current events. There was no evidence of apraxia or neglect.  


Cranial nerve examination revealed round, equal and reactive
pupils with full visual fields to confrontation. Extraocular
movements were full without dysconjugate gaze, nystagmus or
diplopia per report. There was only transient diplopia on
sustained upgaze without ptosis, but with time, the two images
"reunited". There was no facial asymmetry, ptosis or facial
droop. Hearing is intact grossly. Palate elevates symmetrically,
and the strength of trapezii and SCMs was ___ bilaterally. 
Tongue
was strong bilaterally without atrophy or fasiculations.  

Strength examination showed normal bulk, tone throughout. No
pronator drift bilaterally. No adventitious movements, such as
tremor, noted. No asterixis noted. All major muscle groups were
___. 

The sensory examination revealed no deficits to light touch
throughout. Vibratory sense was ~13s at the great toes. Reflexes
were 1+ in the upper extremities and 0 at the patellae and
ankles. Toes were downgoing. 

Bedside tests of cerebellar function revealed no intention
tremor, dysdiadochokinesia or dysmetria. Gait was narrow based
and steady without truncal ataxia. Romberg was negative. 

Discharge exam is notable for worsening horizontal diplopia with 
sustained upward gaze that abates with rest. No apparent defects 
in extraocular movements. No ptosis after sustaine upward gaze. 
Neurologic exam is otherwise normal.
 
Pertinent Results:
FINDINGS: 
  
MR Brain:  There is no evidence of hemorrhage or new infarction. 
There are 
nonspecific small scattered T2/FLAIR high signal foci throughout 
the brain.  
There is expected evolution of the previously described left 
frontal 
subcortical white matter infarct.  Gray white matter 
differentiation is 
otherwise maintained.  Ventricular, cisternal, and sulcal 
prominence may be a 
function of age-related parenchymal volume loss. The major 
intracranial 
vessels exhibit the expected signal void related to vascular 
flow. 
  
The paranasal sinuses demonstrate scattered mucosal thickening 
with near 
complete opacification of the mastoid and sphenoid sinuses.  The 
right greater 
than left mastoid air cells demonstrate fluid signal and 
inflammatory changes. 
The sella turcica, craniocervical junction, and orbits are 
unremarkable. 
  
MRA Head: Normal flow signal is noted in the petrous, cavernous, 
and 
supraclinoid portions of the internal carotid arteries.  The 
right A1 segment 
is diminutive with an azygos continuation of the anterior 
cerebral artery.  
The middle cerebral arteries appear unremarkable. The posterior 
cerebral 
arteries and basilar artery are unremarkable.  The superior 
cerebellar 
arteries are normal.  The intradural segment of both vertebral 
arteries appear 
patent.  The posterior communicating arteries are diminutive 
bilaterally.  The 
right vertebral artery is dominant. No arterial stenosis, 
saccular aneurysm, 
or AVM is identified.   
  
MRA Neck:  The left vertebral artery is smaller in caliber 
compared to the 
contralateral vessel.  The common, internal, and external 
carotid arteries, as 
well as the vertebral arteries, otherwise demonstrate normal 
flow signal.  No 
stenosis is identified.  The origins of the innominate, left 
common carotid, 
and left subclavian arteries, as well as the vertebral arteries, 
are not well 
evaluated in the absence of intravenous contrast.   
  
IMPRESSION: 
  
Age-related involutional and probable chronic microangiopathic 
changes without 
evidence of acute infarct, hemorrhage, or mass effect.   
  
Unremarkable MR angiogram of the head and neck.   
  
Chronic paranasal sinus disease.   
  
Bilateral mastoiditis.   

CT Head:
FINDINGS: 
  
There is no evidence of intracranial hemorrhage, acute major 
vascular 
territorial infarction, shift of the normally midline 
structures, mass effect 
or edema.  The ventricles and sulci are prominent, compatible 
with age-related 
global atrophy.  Periventricular and subcortical white matter 
hypodensities 
likely reflect the sequelae of chronic small vessel ischemic 
disease.  The 
gray-white matter differentiation is preserved.  No fractures 
are identified.  
The cranial and facial soft tissues are unremarkable.  The 
orbits are 
unremarkable.  Mucosal thickening in the ethmoid air cells, 
bilateral 
maxillary sinuses, and air-fluid levels within the sphenoid 
sinuses with 
aerosolized secretions are noted.  Opacification of the mastoid 
air cells, 
right greater than left is also present.   
  
IMPRESSION: 
  
1.  No acute intracranial process. 
  
2.  Chronic small vessel ischemic changes.  
  
3.  Inflammatory paranasal sinus disease and opacification of 
the bilateral 
mastoid air cells, right greater than left.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ was admitted to the stroke neurology service. MRI did 
not show any signs of stroke or other intracranial process to 
explain his diplopia. Diplopia was elicited with sustained 
upward gaze and worsened with fatigue. Therefore, anti-bodies 
for binding and modulating acetylcholinesterase antibodies were 
sent. MuSK antibodies were also sent. These tests are pending. 
Stroke risk factors were assessed and A1C was wnl, LDL was <60. 
TSH was wnl as well. No changes were made to his medications and 
he was discharged with planned neurology follow up.

injury."

CT C-SPine without contrast ___:
"IMPRESSION: 
1. Asymmetric widening of the left C2-C3 facet joint, new from 
the prior study 
from ___, which could reflect interval degenerative 
changes, although 
facet capsular injury cannot definitely be excluded. 
2. No evidence of acute cervical spine fracture or traumatic 
malalignment. 
3. Multilevel degenerative changes, as above."

X-ray Elbow ___:
"FINDINGS:  
There is no fracture.  No acute osseous abnormality.  Mild 
chondrocalcinosis is noted.  Additionally, linear calcific 
density adjacent to the radial neck on the AP and oblique views 
likely in the adjacent soft tissues.  No elbow joint effusion 
based on this exam which is not at full 90 degrees flexion. 
IMPRESSION:  
No visualized fracture."

CT L-Spine without contrast ___:
"IMPRESSION: 
1. Mild left lateral L1 and L2 vertebral body height loss with 
cortical 
step-off laterally suggesting that these are recent fractures. 
2. Compression deformity of L5 resulting in approximately ___ 
loss of 
vertebral body this is new from prior CT in ___ though there is 
no CT 
evidence to suggest that it is acute. 
3. Bilateral L5 pars defects with grade 1 anterolisthesis of L5 
on S1, 
unchanged from prior exam.  Moderate to severe neural foraminal 
narrowing at this level. 
4. Multilevel disc"

TTE ___:
"The left atrial volume index is SEVERELY increased. The right 
atrium is mildly enlarged. There is normal left ventricular wall 
thickness with a small cavity. There is suboptimal image quality 
to assess regional left ventricular function. Overall left 
ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic. The visually 
estimated left ventricular ejection fraction is 80%. Left 
ventricular cardiac index is high (>4.0 L/min/m2). There is no 
resting left ventricular outflow tract gradient. Normal right 
ventricular
cavity size with normal free wall motion. The aortic sinus 
diameter is normal for gender with a mildly dilated ascending 
aorta. The aortic arch is mildly dilated with a normal 
descending aorta diameter. There
is no evidence for an aortic arch coarctation. The aortic valve 
leaflets are moderately thickened. There is mild aortic valve 
stenosis (valve area 1.5-1.9 cm2). There is mild to moderate 
[___] aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are 
mildly thickened with no mitral valve prolapse. There is mild to 
moderate [___] mitral regurgitation. The pulmonic valve 
leaflets are normal. The tricuspid valve leaflets appear 
structurally normal. There is mild to moderate [___] tricuspid 
regurgitation. Due to
acoustic shadowing, the severity of tricuspid regurgitation may 
be UNDERestimated. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic 
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Poor image quality. Small, hyperdynamic left 
ventricle.
Compared with the prior TTE (images reviewed) of ___, 
there is no obvious change, but the suboptimal image quality of 
the studies precludes definitive comparison.

RECOMMEND: If clinically indicated, a TEE is suggested for 
further evaluation of cardiac structure and function."

 
Brief Hospital Course:
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
====================
[] Medications STARTED: apixaban 2.5mg PO BID, multivitamin 
daily
[] Medications STOPPED: warfarin

[] Neurosurgery:
- Please repeat lumbar spine AP and lateral x-rays at follow-up 
appointment with Dr. ___ to assess for progressive kyphosis 


[] Sports medicine/Rehab:
- Please follow-up RUE ROM and symptomatic improvement

[] PCP/REHAB:
- Please repeat CBC in 1 week. H/H 9.4/28.7 and PLTs 150 on 
discharge
- TTE while inpatient was limited, but did not demonstrate a 
clear cause of his potential syncopal event. Consider cardiology 
follow-up and potential TEE in the outpatient setting
- There was concern for proprioceptive defect and peripheral 
neuropathy. He had a normal B12/A1c while inpatient and received 
thiamine x3 as well as started on multivitamin. He may benefit 
from outpatient neurology follow-up as well as outpatient TSH to 
assess etiology of c/f peripheral neuropathy
- Noted to have dyspnea on exertion. His TTE was largely stable 
from prior although somewhat limited. He did have a CT chest 
with evidence of chronic bronchiectasis and distal mucous 
plugging, and thus, PFTs should be ordered in the outpatient 
setting
- Please follow-up blood pressure and adjust home 
anti-hypertensive as needed
- Noted to have 7mm RUL pulmonary nodule. For incidentally 
detected single solid pulmonary nodule measuring 6 to 8 mm, a CT 
follow-up in 6 to 12 months is recommended in a low-risk 
patient, optionally followed by a CT in ___ months. In a 
high-risk patient, a CT follow-up in 6 to 12 months, and a CT in 
___ months is recommended. 

[] Prior to discharge from rehab, please resume homecare 
services for medication management.

Phone number: ___ 

SUMMARY:
=====================
Mr. ___ is an ___ yo male with persistent AF on coumadin, 
tachy-brady syndrome s/p ___ single chamber PPM 
___, CKD, and asthma who presented after
fall from standing position felt to likely be multifactorial due 
to vasovagal event, gait unsteadiness, and proprioceptive 
defect. His fall was complicated by spinal compression 
deformities at L1, L2, and L5, as well as anterolisthesis of L5 
on S1 due to bilateral pars defect, and he was evaluated by 
neurosurgery who recommended no acute intervention with plan to 
follow-up as an outpatient. He was also noted to have R biceps 
injury that was evaluated by ortho without indication for acute 
intervention, and he will follow-up with sports medicine at his 
rehab facility. Due to coagulopathy, he was given vitamin K x1 
with improvement in his INR, and he was eventually transitioned 
to Eliquis as per previous EP recommendatoins. He is being 
discharged to rehab with close orthopedics and sports medicine 
follow-up at rehab. 

ACTIVE ISSUES:
=======================
#C/f syncope
#Dizziness
#Unsteady gait
Patient had fall from standing with symptomatic dizziness prior 
to the fall. The etiology was felt to be due to progressively 
unsteady gait, in the setting of proprioceptive deficit and 
concern for peripheral neuropathy potentially due to nutritional 
deficiency as well as osteoarthropathy given endorsement of 
chronic b/l knee pain. He had a B12 and A1c checked which were 
normal and he was started on multivitamin while also receiving 
thiamine x3. He worked with ___ who noted impaired balance and 
recommended rehab. He also was noted to have dizziness prior to 
the fall in the setting of progressive episodes of diaphoresis, 
shortness of breath and lightheadedness concerning for recurrent 
vasovagal events. He has history of paroxysmal AF, but pacemaker 
interrogation (___) was normal. He underwent TTE, which 
demonstrated EF 80% with a hyderdynamic LV. He was noted to be 
orthostatic, and there may be a contribution from autonomic 
insufficiency, although his symptoms and orthostasis resolved 
with IVF. He may benefit from repeat TTE in the outpatient 
setting as well as potential cardiology and neurology follow-up 
for assessment of potential peripheral neuropathy.

#Compression deformities
#Assymetric anterolisthesis of L5, S1
Due to fall noted above, Ortho and NSGY evaluated the patient, 
and they did not recommend acute surgical intervention. In 
regards to R biceps injury, he was evaluated by Orthopedics 
service who recommend ___ with sports medicine follow-up at 
rehab. Additionally, they encouraged avoidance of a sling unless 
patient is very uncomfortable to avoid frozen shoulder and 
encourage mobilization. On trauma evaluation he was found to 
have spinal compression deformities at L1, L2, and L5, as well 
as anterolisthesis of L5 on S1 due to bilateral pars defect. 
They did not recommend acute intervention, but he will follow-up 
in the ___ clinic in 4 weeks with Dr. ___ with 
repeat lumbar spine AP and lateral x-rays to assess for 
progressive kyphosis. He will be discharged Tylenol ___ TID 
prn.

#Persistent AF
Noted to have a CHADSVASc 5, and presented on coumadin, found to 
have a supratherapeutic INR. Per last EP note at the end of 
___,
plan was to switch over to low dose Eliquis given age and renal
function, and thus, after INR was reversed with vitamin K, he 
was transitioned to 2.5mg Eliquis BID. He initially was started 
on fractionaed metoprolol tartrate 6.25 q6h, but was 
transitioned to home metoprolol succinate 25mg PO daily when his 
orthostasis resolved.

#Macrocytic anemia
#Thrombocytopenia
MCV 103, Hgb likely hemo-concentrated on admission given drop
from 15.5-->9.5 in setting of large ecchymoses. He had a normal 
B12 and normal iron studies in addition to appropriate 
reticulocyte count. He had no history of excessive alcohol use, 
and his thrombocytopenia was felt to be consumptive in the 
setting of acute significant echymoses. His hemoglobin 
stabilized at 9.4 on discharge as did his platelet count which 
was 150. He should have repeat CBC in the outpatient setting.

#Dyspnea
#Asthma
#Chronic bronchiectasis
History of asthma and OSA, not compliant with CPAP. DOE 
concerning for possible cardiac etiology as well. CT chest with 
evidence of chronic bronchiectasis and distal mucous plugging. 
Patient is not hypoxic on room air. Troponin stable at 0.02 on 
admission. TTE was notable for small hyperdynamic left 
ventricle, but there was also poor image quality. He should have 
outpatient PFTs. He was continued on his home duonebs as well as 
home prednisone.

#Coagulopathy
Patient notably unsure about how to dose his warfarin at home. 
He received IV 5mg Vitamin K x1. HIs INR improved and prior to 
discharge, he was transitioned to 2.5mg Eliquis BID. His 
hemoglobin was stable on discharge.

#Hypertension 
Patient has history of hypertension. Home losartan initially 
held in the setting of orthostatic hypotension, but he was 
restarted on his home losartan on discharge.

CT Head: ___   
There is no evidence of infarction, hemorrhage, edema, or mass.  
The 
ventricles and sulci are prominent, due to age related global 
atrophy. 
Periventricular and subcortical white matter hypodensities 
likely reflect the sequelae of chronic small vessel ischemic 
disease.  Vascular arthrosclerotic calcifications are again seen 
in the basilar artery. 
Extensive mucosal thickening is noted in the bilateral maxillary 
sinuses, as well as scattered opacification of the posterior 
ethmoid air cells and mucosal thickening in the sphenoid 
sinuses. Mild fluid is noted in the inferior mastoid air cells 
bilaterally. No fractures are present. The orbits are 
unremarkable. 
  
IMPRESSION:  
No acute intracranial abnormality. Inflammatory paranasal sinus 
disease. 

TTE (___)
The left atrium is moderately dilated. The right atrium is 
moderately dilated. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or 
color Doppler. The estimated right atrial pressure is ___ mmHg. 
Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and regional/global 
systolic function are normal (LVEF >55%). Tissue Doppler imaging 
suggests a normal left ventricular filling pressure 
(PCWP<12mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall 
motion are normal. The aortic root is mildly dilated at the 
sinus level. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The number 
of aortic valve leaflets cannot be determined. The aortic valve 
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. There is no aortic valve 
stenosis. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral 
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve 
prolapse. There is borderline pulmonary artery systolic 
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion. 

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of ___, 
the rhythm is now atrial fibrillation; other findings are 
similar
 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ with HTN, HLD, atrial fibrillation, who presents after 
syncopal episode in setting of poor PO intake, ETOH use, and new 
calcium channel blocker who was found to be bradycardia in the 
ED which has since resolved. 
 
ACTIVE ISSUES:
# Syncope: Likely multifactorial etiology including poor PO 
intake, dehdration, ETOH use, and new medications tamuslosin and 
diltiazem contributing to his symptoms. He had negative 
orthostatics here and has not been bradycardia since admission.  
The patient was monitored on telemetry, and no significant 
events recorded.  His diltiazem and tamusolin was discontinued. 
Electrophysiology consult was obtained and ___ 
___ monitor and outpatient follow-up in two weeks with Dr. 
___.  An echocardiogram did not show any new or acute changes 
as compared to the previous in ___.

# Atrial fibrillation: Has been rate controlled on metoprolol 
which was changed to diltiazem given concern for bronchospasms.  
The patient was continued on his home dose of warfarin 2.5mg.  
INR at discharge is 3.1.  Patient will resume follow-up at the 
___ clinic.  The diltiazem is discontinued with 
HR in ___ off nodal agents.
 
STABLE ISSUES:
# HTN: Patient was continued on home dose of valsartan

# HLD: Patient was continued on home dose of pravastatin 
-Continue pravastatin  

# CKD: Baseline Cr 1.5-1.9. It was 1.7 during hospitalization.   


# Asthma: Patient was given albuterol/ipratropium nebulizers, 
continued on prednisone and transitioned to advair as 
therapeutic interchange for symbicort.  He is discharged back on 
all home medications.

# BPH: His tamsulosin was discontinued as this may have 
contributed to his syncope.

Transitional Issues
1. Will leave with ___ monitor, we stopped diltiazem and 
tamsulosin
2. Will follow up in 2 weeks with Dr. ___ in ___ clinic, and 
with his PCP ___ 1 week.
