CHF, bullous pemphigoid on prednisone, Afib (not anticoagulated) 
presents with dizziness and diarrhea

# Dizziness, Diarrhea, Hypovolemia: 
Pt's symptoms were most likely related to viral gastroenteritis 
although mesenteric ischemia was also possible given patient's 
history of Afib. Pt's diarrhea resolved after admission.  His 
orthostatics were positive initially.  He received gentle IV 
fluid hydration and his diuretics were held.  His orthostatics 
were negative prior to discharge.  His torsemide was restarted 
at a low dose (10 mg PO daily) prior to discharge and was 
monitored for a day on this dose. He was advised to monitor his 
weight closely (75.1 kg on discharge) and increase his torsemide 
to 20 mg daily and call his cardiologist if his weight increases 
by more than 2 lbs. He will follow-up with his cardiologist on 
___.

#Afib with RVR: 
Pt's afib was likely exacerbated by hypovolemia. He received 
gentle IV fluid hydration and his metoprolol and digoxin were 
continued.  

#CHF:
Pt was continued on metoprolol, digoxin, and aspirin. He 
received gentle IV fluid hydration to avoid pulmonary edema.

# Bullous pemphigoid:
Pt was continued on daily prednisone (20 mg) to avoid worsening 
hypotension secondary to acute adrenal insufficiency.

# Delirium: 
Patient was at risk for delirium given age, hospitalization, 
hypovolemia, chronic steroid use. His delirium risk was 
minimized with the following:
- Daily reorientation
- Promote sleep wake cycle by minimizing night time vitals.
- Encourage family visits with daughter ___ who is actively 
involved in patient's care.
- ___ associated disability: OOB to chair.
- Continue vitamin D
- ___ for gait stability.

IMAGING
ECHO ___: The left atrium is elongated. No atrial septal 
defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. The estimated right 
atrial pressure is ___ mmHg. Left ventricular wall thicknesses 
and cavity size are normal. There is mild regional left 
ventricular systolic dysfunction with hypokinesis of the basal 
to mid anterolateral walls). The remaining segments contract 
normally (LVEF = 50-55%). The right ventricular free wall is 
hypertrophied with normal chamber size and free wall 
contractility. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic 
valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. There is no aortic 
valve stenosis. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The 
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral 
valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The 
tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. The estimated 
pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There is a 
trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion. 

IMPRESSION: Mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction 
c/w CAD (Diagonal branch distribution) with normal cavity size 
and wall thicknesses. Right ventricular hypertrophy with normal 
cavity size and free wall contractility. Mild aortic 
regurgitation, mild mitral regurgitation, and mild tricuspid 
regurgitation.

___ hx HTN, longstanding thrombocytopenia, BPH presents from 
primary care doctor's office with Afib with rapid ventricular 
response with rate to 140s. Was given IV metoprolol in ED then 
started on 12.5 mg TID with good rate control. With CHADS2 score 
of 2 and discussion with family about risks of bleeding we 
decided it was not a good idea to start coumadin. ASA 81 was 
started in stead. His blood pressures were normotensive with the 
metoprolol so his lisinopril was held at d/c. Also, we held his 
lasix at d/c as he does not have clinical CHF based on 
echocardiogram done while in house. 

OTHER ACTIVE ISSUES  
# DIARRHEA: Likely secondary to viral illness, but this has been 
ongoing for 2 weeks. Was screened in ED for norovirus. 
Electrolytes are currently stable. No recent antibiotic usage 
and no leukocytosis currently.  

# HYPOTHYROIDISM: Found to have elevated TSH incidentally during 
workup for Afib. Possibly also contributory to depression. We 
were reluctant to start thyroid replacement in-house due to Afib 
and diarrhea.  

# Ankle Edema: Has had this for some time and currently does not 
appear more swollen than at baseline. Patient currently appears 
euvolemic. Unclear if this is venous insufficiency or sequela of 
heart failure which would be more likely diastolic.  

INACTIVE ISSUES
# HTN: Pressures controlled currently controlled. Lisinopril 
held initially for possibly elevated creatinine, and no 
restarted on discharge since pressures under good contol with 
metoprolol.  

# Essential Tremor: Stable. Patient reports weight loss 
requiring loosening of his belt per PCP, which is possibly a 
side effect of his topamax.  
# Depression: Secondary to death of wife in ___. Continued 
paroxetine  
# BPH: continued home terazosin  

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES
# Consider starting thyroid replacement as outpatient

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,

Thank you for choosing us for your care. You were admitted for a 
fast heart rhythm called atrial fibrillation. We controlled your 
heart rate with the medicine Metoprolol.

We did an ultrasound of your heart, monitored your rhythm 
overnight did blood tests. We did not find any significant 
factors that may have incited atrial fibrillation. At present, 
we believe this may be due to age related changes.

You also reported diarrhea at home. We do not think that this 
diarrhea was infectious.  Your primary care doctor can help come 
up with a strategy to work up and treat the cause of the 
diarrhea.  

Please see the attached medications sheet to see your updated 
medication list.

IMAGING/STUDIES:
ECG ___
Probable sinus tachycardia. Right bundle-branch block. 
Non-specific ST-T wave changes. Compared to the previous tracing 
of ___ the patient is now in sinus rhythm.  TRACING #1 

CXR ___
1. Mild cardiomegaly with pleural effusions, left greater than 
right, and 
bibasilar atelectasis.   
2. Fullness of the superior mediastinum, which may be consistent 
with a 
substernal goiter.  Correlation with physical exam is 
recommended. 
  
TTE ___
The left atrium is dilated. There is mild symmetric left 
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is 
normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely 
depressed (LVEF = 25 %) secondary to severe global; hypokinesis 
with posterior wall akinesis. The right ventricular free wall 
thickness is normal. Right ventricular chamber size is normal. 
with severe global free wall hypokinesis. The aortic root is 
mildly dilated at the sinus level. The aortic valve leaflets (3) 
are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Trace 
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are 
mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) 
mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are 
mildly thickened. There is a very small pericardial effusion 
without evidence of tamponade. 

Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed) 
of ___, contractile function of the left and right 
ventricle is markedly reduced.  

___ ECG
Sinus tachycardia. Occasional atrial premature contractions. 
Compared to 
tracing #1 there is no significant diagnostic change. TRACING #2 


CTA Chest ___
COMPARISON:  PA and lateral chest radiograph from ___. 

  
TECHNIQUE:  Axial helical MDCT images were obtained from the 
suprasternal 
notch to the upper abdomen at an early arterial phase after 
administration of 
100 cc of Visipaque following a PE protocol.  Coronal, sagittal, 
and oblique 
MIP reformats were generated in an independent workstation. 
  
DLP:  591.79 mGy-cm. 
CTDI:  26.47 mGy. 
  
FINDINGS: 
  
THORAX CTA:  The aorta is well opacified.  There are significant 

atherosclerotic calcifications of the aorta, but no aneurysmal 
dilatation, 
intramural hematoma, or aortic dissection.  The pulmonary 
arteries are well 
opacified through the subsegmental level. There is no dilatation 
of the main 
pulmonary trunk. No filling defects are noted in the pulmonary 
arteries to 
suggest pulmonary embolism. Coronary artery calcifications are 
extensive. The 
heart appears enlarged. 
  
CHEST CT:  The airways are patent to the subsegmental level.  
There is no 
central or axillary lymphadenopathy. There is trace pericardial 
fluid, which 
is non-hemorrhagic.  No esophageal abnormalities noted.   
  
Lung windows demonstrate no focal opacities, but there are 
moderate bilateral pleural effusions, right worse than left, 
with concurrent bibasilar atelectasis. 
  
There is intraperitoneal fluid.  No gross abnormalities of the 
spleen or liver are observed on limited evaluation.  The kidneys 
cannot be accurately assessed due to phase of contrast, but a 
large cyst is noted in the upper pole of the right kidney that 
appears simple. 
  
OSSEOUS STRUCTURES:  There are no lytic or blastic lesions 
concerning for 
malignancy. 
  
IMPRESSION: 
1.  No pulmonary embolism or acute aortic syndrome. 
2.  Moderate bilateral pleural effusions with concurrent 
bibasilar 
atelectasis. Small volume ascites in the visualized abdomen. 
3.  No focal parenchymal opacity or evidence of pulmonary edema. 

 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ with h/o HTN, mild sCHF (LVEF = 50-55% ___ presenting 
with several weeks of progressive SOB and signs of gross volume 
overload on exam.

# Acute on chronic systolic CHF: Patient presented with 
shortness of breath and gross volume overload in the setting of 
rapid aflutter (120s on admission) and discontinuation of 
diuretic on prior admission. TTE ___ showed LVEF of 25%, 
reduced compared to prior EF 50-55% on prior TTE ___. Based 
on patient's lack of palpitations, tachycardia may have been 
persistent for several weeks ( as suggested by HR 120s in recent 
clinic visits), suggesting tachycardia induced cardiomyopathy. 
Rate was controlled as described below and patient was diuresed 
with IV lasix boluses with good response. He was weaned off of 
supplemental O2 and weight was noted to decrease by 15kg from 
admission. Transitioned to PO torsemide morning of ___. 

# Atrial flutter: Admitted with atrial flutter @ 120s. CHADS2. 
Patient reported intermittent sx of palpitations in preceding 
weeks but was asymptomatic throughout admission. PE considered 
as possible trigger- low risk by Well's Criteria, D-dimer 
elevated 1408 but CTA chest negative for PE. Digoxin intitiated 
___, home metoprolol dose increased and rates were 
subsequently well controlled. 

___: Baseline Cr appears to be 1.3-1.5. Cr increased to 1.8 ___ 
in the setting of diuresis, but subsequently decreased to 1.4 
and remained stable.

# Dysuria: Patient reported some dysuria and had mild suprapubic 
tenderness to palpation on admission exam. He was started 
empirically on bactrim on admission which was discontinued after 
urine culture returned negative.

# Hematuria:  Noted to have hematuria and passing clots via 
foley ___. Urine output and HCT remained stable. Urine 
subsequently became more clear without intervention. Foley 
removed ___ when transitioned to PO diuretic and patient had no 
difficulty voiding. 

# HTN: Blood pressures well controlled this admission on beta 
blocker. 

# Depression: Was in very good spirits this admission, denied 
depressed mood, SI/HI. Continued home SSRIs.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
# Hematuria: Will need repeat UA at follow up to ensure 
resolution
# ___: Will need volume status monitored as outpatient and PO 
torsemide adjusted accordingly

   URINE CULTURE (Final ___:    NO GROWTH.

___ EKG Atrial fibrillation with a moderate ventricular 
response. Baseline artifact. Right bundle-branch block. Compared 
to the previous tracing of ___ no diagnostic interim change. 
 
Rate PR QRS QT/QTc P QRS T 
83 0 ___ 0 -3 -146 
 
___ HIP.PELVIS X RAY. FINDINGS: AP view of the pelvis.  AP 
and frogleg views of the right hip.  The bones are diffusely 
osteopenic.  There is no fracture or acute osseous abnormality.  
Pubic symphysis and SI joints are preserved.  Degenerative 
changes noted in the lumbar spine.  Right femoroacetabular joint 
demonstrates mild degenerative changes without fracture or 
malalignment.  Atherosclerotic calcifications seen within the 
vessels.  Surgical clips project over the lower abdomen and 
pelvis. 
IMPRESSION:  No acute fracture. 

___ CXR
FINDINGS:  When compared to prior, there has been no significant 
interval 
change.  Again seen is retrocardiac opacity which could 
represent a 
combination of effusion, atelectasis and consolidation.  
Elsewhere, the lungs are clear.  The cardiac silhouette is 
enlarged but stable in configuration.  Dense atherosclerotic 
calcifications seen in the aorta.  Surgical clips in the right 
upper quadrant.  No acute osseous abnormality is identified. 

___ FINDINGS:  AP, OBLIQUE, AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE RIGHT 
ELBOW:  There is no evidence of acute fracture or dislocation.  
Evaluation for a joint effusion is limited as a true lateral 
view is not provided.  The joint spaces are preserved.  No 
concerning osseous lesion or abnormal soft tissue calcification 
is identified. 
  
IMPRESSION:  No evidence of acute fracture or dislocation. 
  
CT C SPINE W/O CONTRSAT
FINDINGS:   
There is no evidence of acute fracture.  Extensive degenerative 
changes are again noted and are relatively unchanged compared to 
the prior examination.  
This includes reversal of the cervical lordosis centered at C5-6 
with complete fusion of the C5-6 vertebral bodies and partial 
fusion of the C6-7 vertebral bodies.  Mild anterolisthesis of C3 
on C4 is also unchanged.  Loss of disc height, uncovertebral and 
facet joint arthropathy is most severe from C4 through C7, as 
before.  Bones are diffusely osteopenic.  There is no 
prevertebral soft tissue abnormality.  Calcifications are again 
noted along the aortic arch. 
  
Limited view of the lung apices now demonstrates a new focus of 
airspace 
opacification along the bronchovascular tree.  Moderate 
bilateral pleural 
effusions are present. 
  
IMPRESSION: 
1.  Stable appearance of severe multilevel degenerative changes 
without 
evidence of acute fracture. 
2.  Interval development of increased airspace opacification 
along the 
bronchovascular tree in the left apex, consistent with 
bronchopneumonia in the appropriate clinical setting. 
3.  Moderate bilateral pleural effusions. 

CT ABD/PELV
FINDINGS:   
Partially imaged lung bases are notable for small-to-moderate 
bilateral 
pleural effusions, increased on the right, and adjacent 
compressive 
atelectasis. Cardiomegaly and coronary artery calcifications are 
noted. 
  
CT ABDOMEN:  Evaluation of intra-abdominal structures is limited 
by lack of intravenous contrast.  Non-contrast enhanced 
appearance of the liver, spleen, pancreas and adrenal glands is 
unremarkable. 
  
A homogeneous well-circumscribed lobulated soft tissue density 
superior to the right kidney measuring 3.8 x 6.6 cm (2:13), 
previously 4.2 x 6.4 cm, is virtually unchanged compared to the 
prior examination and likely represents a benign process. 
  
Stomach is decompressed.  Nondilated loops of small bowel are 
normal in course and caliber.  The colon is notable for 
extensive sigmoid diverticulosis without diverticulitis.  There 
is no intra-abdominal free air or fluid.  
Extensive atherosclerotic calcifications are noted along a 
tortuous abdominal aorta and iliac arteries without aneurysmal 
dilatation.  There is no mesenteric or retroperitoneal 
lymphadenopathy. 
  
CT PELVIS:  The bladder is decompressed around a Foley catheter 
Prostate is enlarged. There is no pelvic free fluid or 
lymphadenopathy. 
  
BONE WINDOW:  Severe multilevel degenerative changes in the 
imaged spine 
including mild anterolisthesis of L5 on S1 and L4 on L5 is 
unchanged.  There is, however, increased irregularity and 
cortical discontinuity at the inferior endplate of the L3 
vertebral body not present on the prior study of ___. The fracture line extends to the anterior wall of the L3 
vertebral body. There is also buckling of the posterior wall of 
L3, but no definite evidence of retropulsion into the canal.  
  
IMPRESSION: 
1. New compression fracture of the L3 vertebral body as 
described above.  
2. Small-to-moderate bilateral pleural effusions, increased on 
the right. 
3. A 2.8 x 6.6 cm lobulated mass superior to the right kidney 
and independent from the right kidney and the right adrenal 
gland, probably represents a benign process as there has been no 
change compared to the prior study. 

___ CT HEAD
FINDINGS: 
There is no evidence of hemorrhage, edema, mass effect, or acute 
vascular 
territorial infarction.  Prominent ventricles and sulci are 
unchanged, likely represent age-related involutional changes or 
atrophy.  A cavum septum pellucidum variant is again noted.  
Basilar cisterns are patent.  Gray-white matter differentiation 
is preserved. 
  
Partially imaged paranasal sinuses, mastoid air cells, and 
middle ear cavities are clear.  Orbits are unremarkable.  No 
acute fracture is identified. 
  
IMPRESSION:  No evidence of acute intracranial abnormality. 
  
___ T SPINE X RAY FINDINGS:  
AP and lateral views of the thoracic spine show depression of 
the right side of the superior endplate of T10, similar in 
degree to that seen on the coronal images from the previous CT 
images.  This is less evident on both sagittal and today's 
lateral views but there is no posterior displacement of bone.  
Vertebral bodies appear diffusely demineralized. Intervertebral 
disk disease and associated subchondral sclerosis is seen at 
L1-L2 on the right and at L2-L3, included the view of this 
study.  Calcified atherosclerotic plaque is seen throughout the 
descending thoracic aorta which is not dilated.  Surgical clips 
are seen in the right upper quadrant. 
  
IMPRESSION:  Demineralized thoracic vertebral bodies and 
unchanged minimal nonacute superior endplate compression at T10 
compared to ___. 
 
Brief Hospital Course:
BRIEF HOSPITAL COURSE
======================
Mr. ___ is a ___ year old gentleman with history of atrial 
fibrillation, sCHF (LVEF 25%), dementia, and orthostatic 
hypotension presenting with encephalopathy and new L3 
compression fracture. He was managed conservatively with speedy 
improvement in his mental status. He was discharged to a short 
term rehab.

ACTIVE MEDICAL ISSUES
======================
# Fall with new L3 compression fracture: Trauma workup in ___ 
revealed L3 compression fracture. He was evaluated by 
Orthopedics who initially recommended MRI, but given the 
patient's goals of care and comfort, recommended soft LSO brace. 
Physical therapy evaluated the patient and recommended short 
term rehab. His vitamin D was increased to ___ units daily. 
 
# Encephalopathy in the setting of dementia: He was quite 
lethargic on admission. Likely encephalopathy secondary to pain. 
His urine culture was negative and T4 and B12 were normal. We 
minimized tethers and treated pain with acetaminophen (standing, 
as the patient is very stoic) and a lidocaine patch. He was 
started on short term oral supplements to promote wound healing. 

- Should continue glucerna TID after discharge. 

# Acute on chronic sCHF: EF 25%. Dry weight as of ___ was 
162 lbs. He was continued on torsemide and digoxin.
 
#CKD: He was below his recent baseline (creatinine 1.5-1.7).
 
# Afib: CHADS2 of 3 at home. On ASA 81 per prior discussions 
with family about anticoagulation. He was continued on 
metoprolol and digoxin 0.0625 daily once able to take PO. 
 
# R adrenal/kidney mass: 4 x 7 cm lobulated mass immediately 
superior to the right kidney. Deferred further workup given 
would likely be invasive and unlikely to improve patient's 
quality or quantity of life.  
 
# Bullous pemphigoid: continued home prednisone.
 
# Depression: continued home mirtazapine and venlafaxine.
 
# HTN: Continued metoprolol as above.
 
# OSA: on CPAP at home. This was continued in house. Please 
ensure patient wears CPAP at night at facility. Has f/u 
appointment made with sleep medicine.

History of Present Illness:
Mr. ___ is a ___ year old male with PMHx of atrial 
fibrillation, sCHF (LVEF 25%), HTN, dementia, and orthostatic 
hypotension with tendency to fall who was found down in his 
nursing home in another patient's room, apparently confused. The 
fall was unwitnessed and it is unclear if syncope occurred. Did 
strike his head. He denies any current pain or other symptoms. 
He does not remember that he fell. According to his daughter he 
has had gradually progressive dementia and has been scheduled to 
be transferred to from ___ to the memory 
care unit next week. She says that nursing at ___ thought he 
seemed slightly more confused than usual today.
 
In the ED, initial vital signs were: 98 ___ 16 94% RA 
Labs were notable for normal WBC, H/H, plt 132, negative UA, 
Lactate:2.3. Cr 1.7 (baseline 1.7-2.0). Dig level- 0.9.

Brief Hospital Course:
___ year old male with PMHx of atrial fibrillation, sCHF (LVEF 
25%), HTN, dementia, and orthostatic hypotension with tendency 
to fall who was found down in his nursing home in another 
patient's room. 

# Fall/?Syncope: Fall was unwitnessed and patient cannot recall 
fall, likely due to baseline dementia. Trauma workup in ED 
negative. Was in RVR on admission, may have contributed. No 
further RVR on tele. Orthostatics were negative on admission but 
after diuresis, he was noted to be orthostatic with systolic BP 
134 from lying down to 114 on sitting and symptomatic, so 
torsemide dose was adjusted at discharge.  He was seen by ___ and 
is being discharged to ___ with plan for eventual 
placement to dementia unit.

# ?Mural thrombus in LA: Seen on CT Chest done for trauma 
screen. Would not anticoagulate even if thrombus was present 
given goals of care. Continued ASA 81.

# Dementia: Confused at baseline. Difficult to be sure, but 
seems close to baseline per daughter. Family was planning to 
transition to dementia unit at ___ this week.
Plan to continue with this transition in the coming weeks.

# Acute on chronic sCHF: EF 25%. Dry weight as of ___ was 
162 lbs. Weight here is 154 lbds, but pt clearly appears volume 
up on exam (bibasilar crackles, 2+ pitting edema to hips, JVD). 
Increased home torsemide to 30mg daily but decreased down to 20 
mg daily with 10 mg every other day dosing as needed for 
increased edema or weight increase. Continued digoxin, 
betablocker, 2g sodium diet.

# Afib: CHADS2 of 3. Continued betablocker, ASA 81, digoxin.

# R adrenal/kidney mass: 4 x 7 cm lobulated mass immediately 
superior to the right kidney. Per radiology read, likely 
represents a benign lymphangioma.  Will defer further workup 
given would likely be invasive and unlikely to improve pt 
quality or quantity of life.

# Bullous pemphigoid: continue home prednisone.

# Depression: cont home mirtazepine and venlafaxine.

# HTN: cont metop as above.

# OSA: on CPAP at home. Cont in house.

Transitional Issues:
- Discharge torsemide dose 20 mg daily with additional 10 mg 
every other day as needed.  Patient noted to be orthostatic at 
discharge; if symptomatic, would continue to reassess diuresis.
- Held home daily potassium repletion; please continue to 
monitor level daily and replete as needed.
