Imaging:

CTA head and neck: ___

IMPRESSION: 
  
1. Age appropriate central and cortical involutional changes 
without evidence 
of acute intracranial process. 
  
2. Marked atherosclerotic calcification of the cavernous 
internal carotid 
arteries, bilaterally, without evidence of hemodynamically 
significant 
stenosis involving the intra- or extra-cranial arterial 
vasculature. 

MRI brain ___ without contrast:

IMPRESSION: 
  
1. No MR evidence of acute intracranial process. 
  
2. Central and cortical involutional changes as expected for the 
patient's age of ___ years. 

Chest Xray - preliminary - no acute abnormality.
 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ year old woman with a history of HTN, HL, and hypothyroidism 
presented with acute onset loss of right sided vision (white out 
of her vision)  for ___ seconds without
associated headache.  Patient was evaluated as a CODE STROKE due

her low score and prior ressolution of symptoms. 

On admission, her examination was non focal, namely there was no 
temporal area tenderness, no papilledema, no red cherry spots 
and her visual acuity was ___ L and R corrected 
respectively.  

CTA head/neck showed marked calcification along cavernous 
internal carotid arteries bilaterally, but was otherwise 
unremarkable.  Head MRI w/o contrast showed no evidence of 
stroke.  It was felt that patient had a temporary central 
retinal artery occlusion from calcifications as mentioned above. 
 She was started on ASA 81mg daily and her statin was increased 
to 40 mg daily.  She instructed to follow up with her 
opthalmologist within one week of discharge, her PCP and
