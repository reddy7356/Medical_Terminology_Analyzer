   URINE CULTURE (Pending): 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ was admitted to Dr. ___ for 
nephrolithiasis management with a known 5mm left proximal 
ureteral stone causeing mild pain, leukocytosis and mild acute 
kidney injury. He was admitted for pain control and observation 
with a tentative plan for urgent operative intervention if 
evidence of further deterioration. He was started on flomax, 
intravenous fluids and given intravenous antibiotics. Overnight, 
Mr. ___ was hydrated with intravenous fluids and received 
appropriate antibiotics and pain control and on hospital day 
two, his labs and symptoms had improved. On HD1, he was thus 
discharged home with a plan to return in about two weeks time 
for ultrasound and perhaps definitive management. At discharge, 
Mr. ___ pain was well controlled with oral pain 
medications, he was tolerating regular diet, ambulating without 
assistance, and voiding without difficulty. He was explicitly 
advised to follow up as directed for ultrasound, to complete the 
course of antibiotics and to strain his urine for stone capture.

Discharge Instructions:
-You can expect to see occasional blood in your urine and to

month;  this may be related to the passage of stone fragments or 
the indwelling ureteral stent (if there is one).

-The kidney stone may or may not have been removed AND/or there 
may fragments/others still in the process of passing. Please 
CONTINUE TO STRAIN URINE FOR STONES and SAVE for pathology if 
captured.

-You may experience some pain associated with spasm of your 
ureter.; This is normal. Take the narcotic pain medication as 
prescribed if additional pain relief is needed.

-Ureteral stents MUST be removed or exchanged and therefore it

-You may continue to periodically see small amounts of blood in 
your urine--this is normal and will gradually improve

-IBUPROFEN (the ingredient of Advil, Motrin, etc.) may be taken 
even though you may also be taking Tylenol/Acetaminophen. You

is needed.

-Ibuprofen should always be taken with food. Please discontinue 
taking and notify your doctor should you develop blood in your 
stool (dark, tarry stools)
