      INTERPRETATION: RESULTS INDICATIVE OF PAST EBV INFECTION. 
      In most populations, 90% of adults have been infected at 
sometime
      with EBV and will have measurable VCA IgG and EBNA 
antibodies.
      Antibodies to EBNA develop ___ weeks after primary 
infection and
      remain present for life. Presence of VCA IgM antibodies 
indicates
      recent primary infection. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
The patient is a ___ year old female with aplastic anemia on 
cyclosporin who presents with sore throat, possible fever, and 
vaginal bleeding in the setting of stopping her OCPs and 
re-starting them 2 weeks prior to presentation.

ACTIVE ISSUES:
  
# Aplastic anemia: Acute on chronic pancytopenia on 
cyclosporine, previously treated with ATG. Current degree of 
anemia likely secondary to dysfunctional uterine bleeding in the 
setting of briefly stopping her OCPs and concurrent 
thrombocytopenia in the setting exacerbation of her aplastic 
anemia. Baseline counts from ___ reportedly WBC 6.3, 
Neutrophils 3500, Hgb 10.6, Plt 46. Given her sore throat, 
reported fever/chills, and exposures to others with similar 
symptoms, thought to be secondary to viral infection with 
subsequent bone marrow suppression. IgG EBV positive but without 
acute infection based on negative IgM. B12, folate, TSH normal. 
She was transfused 1 bag of platelets at an outside hospital 
with appropriate bump. She was not transfused any blood products 
while here given her stability and had resolution of her menses. 
Her home dose of cyclosporine was continued. She was discharged 
with specific plans to follow-up with her outpatient 
hematologist in ___ and to have labs drawn and faxed to 
Dr. ___.
 
# Febrile neutropenia: Given her report 2 days ago of chills 
with fever and decreased neutrophil count to 900 on admission, 
she was diagnosed with febrile neutropenia and subsequently 
started on cefepime. She remained afebrile and had complete 
resolution of her URI symptoms without any other clinical 
evidence of infection while in-house. Given her clinical 
stability and her insistence on leaving the hospital to go back 
to her providers in ___, the decision was made to 
discharge her on oral levofloxacin for a 7-day course so that 
she could follow-up with her regular doctors. All culture data 
remained negative.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,

It was a pleasure to care for you during your hospitalization. 
As you recall, you were admitted to ___ from ___

also recently been experiencing throat pain and chills with a 
fever. You underwent an evaluation which included blood tests 
that showed decreased blood counts and you were transfused 1 ___.
You were transfered to ___ on ___, for further 
evaluation. You were worked up for infection and placed on 
empiric antibiotics.
During the time of your admission here, the CBC has remained 
overall stable, although your platelet started to drop again 
today. Your CBC from ___ shows white blood cell count of 
___, platelet count is 48,000 and the hemoglobin is 7.3. 
Your symptoms improved with almost complete resolution of the 
vaginal bleeding, no fevers and improvement of the upper 
respiratory complaints.

You are now requesting to be discharged with the plan to fly 
back to ___ and see your doctors in follow up in the next

work is overall stable, we agree with your discharge. 
You should continue the empiric antibiotic and have a repeat CBC 
tomorrow morning.
