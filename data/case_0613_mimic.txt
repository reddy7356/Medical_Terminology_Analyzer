Psychiatric:  ___ yo woman with h/o depression, possibility of 
psychotic sx, and  PSA who was admitted s/p SA following the 
death of her best friend ___. SA entailed drinking ETOH and 
smoking cocaine laced with "embalming fluid."  Endorses some 
passive SI in setting of multiple social stressors. She stated 
multiple times that she does not not want to be around the 
people she loves, secondary to the fact that "everyone I love 
dies."  She was also seen to perseverate  on the fact that she 
had no one she could trust.  Yet, after several discussions, she 
agreed that she had many, very meaningful supports in her life, 
such as her twin sons, her brother, and her close friend/boss. 
Throughout her stay, her mood improved and she became more able 
to discuss the abusive nature of the relationship with her 
boyfriend.   

Following a few days of groups and pharmacotherapy she denied 
any persistant thoughts of self harm.  She was pleasant 
throughout stay and very cooperative during daily interviews. 
She exhibited being future oriented,and was very happy about her 
opportunity to move into the home of her friend who recently 
passed, ___.  She endorses having hopes she will separate from 
her abusive boyfriend, but reports that she will most likey 
continue to see him when she wants to "have fun."   This was 
noted by the team as a possible indication that she is not 
dedicated to eliminating toxic influences in her life. She is 
supported emotionally by her boss.  She reported a very good and 
supportive relationship with her brother as well, and agreed 
that this relationship is not one she avoid.  Upon discharge, 
she was eager to leave and begin living in this new apartment.

Celexa was increased to 40mg po qd for depression and she was 
encouraged to participate in groups. Substance abuse treatment 
was offered to her, yet she declined, stating that she does not 
have a problem with subtsances. In addition, she refused a 
referral to the domestic violence prevention program, for fear 
that her boyfriend would become privy.   We counseled patient 
that it would absolutely in her best interest to accept the 
referal, but she continued to refuse. She did report that she 
would attend her follow up appts. 

At time of discharge, she denied any thoughts of self harm, was 
future oriented, looking forward to moving into her new

polysubstance abuse, and mood d/o NOS with question of psychotic 
features and PTSD who was brought in
by ambulance after she called ___ triage with SI with intent to 
overdose. 

The pt was initially dismissive of her symptoms and repeatedly 
mumbles "I'm fine now, I just want to go home, everything is 
fine." She says "the lady thought I was depressed, I'm fine 
now." She called because she wanted someone to talk to, but 
offers no explanation of why someone would think she was 
suicidal or why
they would think she intended to OD. She eventually endorses "I 
took some pain pills and something else, but it didn't work, I'm 
still here." She expresses vague stressors of "everyone expects 
so much" and "I can't take it anymore," but will not offer 
further explanation. While visibly crying and shaking she denies

could she talk to or who could I talk to she says she doesn't 
know. When I told her that I needed to make certain she could

have a safe plan. How can I have one out there, when I can't get 
one in
my mind." She said she wished to be hospitalized (after 
repeatedly requesting to go home) as long as it was BI or 
___, "otherwise forget it." When asked how a hospitalization 
would be beneficial this time, she says "I shouldn't have left 
early last time, but my sister needed me."

happy, poor sleep with difficult onset and maintenance, lack of 
interests (used to enjoy painting, skating, swimming), ok 
motivation, sluggish energy, ok appetite with intentional wt 
loss, decreased concentration, ok memory. She is vague about SI,
but clearly reported to ___ triage SI and intent to OD and 
reported to me she had taken an unknown amount of unknown pills.

now." She denied symptoms consistent with mania. She vaguelly 
endorsed visual hallucinations (seeing shadows) and possible 
hearing
people call her name. She endorsed panic attacks with SOB and 
CP. She endorsed frequent bloody nightmares, which have been 
worse over the past month and a half. She endorsed physical and

Brief Hospital Course:
PSYCHIATRIC

#) POLYSUBSTANCE ABUSE: The patient presented after usage and 
intoxication with both alcohol and cocaine. Her utox was 
positive for cocaine in the ___. She was carefully monitored for 
alcohol withdrawal and cocaine withdrawal during her 
hospitalization but was noted to never demonstrate any signs of 
symptoms of such and thus no treatment was necessary for such. 
The patient was educated on the dangers of her alcohol and 
cocaine use but continued to minimize her use of both 
substances. When confronted with evidence of similar patterns of 
polysubstance noted in past ___ notes dating back to ___ the 
patient laughed and stated "I guess things don't change." The 
patient did note her polysubstance abuse is the driving factor 
in her suicidal ideations and agreed that the use of cocaine or 
alcohol was dangerous for her. She agreed she will try to 
refrain from such now although was less concrete when asked to 
identify exactly how she plans to accomplish such. The team 
suggested numerous substance use programs for the patient to 
follow up with and she indicated she would "consider" such, 
especially AA at a local church and obtaining a sponsor.

#) BORDERLINE PERSONALITY DISORDER: Her presentation was notable 
for also being  consistent with borderline personality disorder 
given the her well documented history over ___ years that is 
remarkably consistent over such a large time span for patterns 
of unstable relationships, impulsivity, recurrent suicidal 
gestures,affective instability, and difficulty at times 
controlling anger. The patient was informed of this diagnosis 
and educated about boderline personality disorder and said she 
was willing to work with an outpatient therapist to follow such 
up with. She said she might be interested in outpatient DBT but 
was also unsure.

#) IRRITABILITY: The patient was noted to be irritable and at 
times frustrated. The differential of substance induced mood 
disorder versus borderline personality disorder versus 
underlying irritability/ impulsivity was considered. The patient 
was noted to have tolerated risperdione well in the past with no 
noted side effects and so we restarted such at 0.5mg BID which 
the patient also tolerated well with no noted side effects. The 
patient reported that this medication helped her feel "more 
calm" and "less upset." 

# SUICIDAL IDEATION: The patient report suicidal ideations with 
plan to overdose on various medications while in the Emergency 
Department. On the the unit, she constantly denied suicidal 
ideations and reported future orientation with plans to continue 
with her work at an ___ and to reconnect with her 
children. There were no noted safety concerns regarding the 
patient while she was on the unit. She noted she only feels 
suicidal in the context of cocaine of alcohol intoxication and 
reported that she understands that she must refrain from 
substance abuse for her safety. She reported that if she does 
ever feel unsafe in the future, she knows how to call for help 
as demonstrated by her numerous Emergency Department visits over 
the past ___ years.

#ABUSE: ___
#)Hypertension: The patient was noted to have hypertensive blood 
pressures. She denied currently taking any medication and could 
not recall what medication she previously prescribed. Per 
reviewing OMR, the team noted she has tolerated HCTZ well in the 
past and we thus restarted such at 12.5mg with noted improvement 
in her blood pressure. The patient was advised on the importance 
of taking this medication on a daily basis and educated about 
the consequences of poorly controlled hypertension including 
heart disease and stroke.

#Anemia: The patient suffers from chronic anemia / thalesemia 
trait. Her blood work on ___ was notable for stable and 
unchanged values of her hematocrit from her baseline.

polysubstance abuse and noted she does not have suicidal 
thoughts or plans except when using alcohol or cocaine. He noted 
he feels the patient is not a risk or harm to herself and feels 
that she would be safe to discharge. He understands that she 
will need to refrain from all substances and agrees to help 
monitor the patient for such and encourage her to follow up with 
various substance abuse resources.

LEGAL STATUS: The patient was admitted to the unit on a CV.

RISK ASSESSMENT: This patient has a low risk of imminent danger 
to herself or others.  The patient has several risk factors for 
self harm including a chronic history of poly-substance abuse, a 
long term history of poor medication and outpatient follow up 
compliance, a history of abuse, her age, gender, and race. She 
also has numerous protective factors including no access to 
weapons, numerous instances of help seeking behaviors, and 
future orientation. While in the hospital we attempted to 
address all of her modifiable risk factors. We addressed her 
poly-substance abuse by offering her 
counselling/education/therapy on such as well as referring her 
to numerous community and outpatient resources. On discharge she 
told the team she plans "stop" her alcohol and cocaine use. We 
addressed her history of impulsivity by starting her on 
risperidone 0.5mg BID which she tolerated well and noted help 
her feel calmer and "less upset." Still given her well 
documented history of at least 20+ years of polysubstance abuse 
as well as static risk factors such a age, gender, and race the 
patient remains at an elevated risk for self harm although at 
this point is not at imminent danger to herself requiring 
inpatient level of care.

least one month prior to admission.

History of Present Illness:
___ year old woman with history of depression, PTSD, and

intoxication.  Pt was a poor historian at time of interview with 
pressured, tangential speech, unable to clearly indicate
chronology.  However, she gives a history of not being able to 
sleep for about 5 nights now, partly because a tenant at her 
apartment, ___, apparently walks around naked and attempts to 
touch her when she goes to sleep. Last night, she drank unknown 
quantities of alcohol, took some crack cocaine, Ambien, tylenol
___, nyquil and Seroquel in an attempt to sleep.  She is unclear 
about the quantities and timings.  She interjects some thoughts 
of not wanting to live anymore: "what's the point of living, 
I've tried to kill myself so many times but it doesn't work".  
She reports hearing voices "telling me I'm worthless, just kill 
myself and get it over with now". 

Pt says she is ambivalent about currently being alive, although 
she notes, "I wouldn't try to hurt myself again."  Pt says she 
has been drinking a lot more than usual over the past few weeks 
to try and numb her depression and drown out her AH.  She has AH 
of voices only when she is depressed.  She say if she drinks
enough she can "drowned them out."  She is unable to quantify 
how much alcohol she has been drinking.

reports that this morning around 5:30 am, he picked up the 
patient to take her to work (she works as a ___ for his 
___) and "this was the worst she has ever 
looked".  She was 'ranting and raving' about being unable to 
sleep due to ___. He also reports that the patient's mother 
died a year ago, but the patient has not been able to accept her 
death and will speak as though she is still alive.  The 
patient's mother apparently accused her of killing her sister in 
childhood
and this has been a longtime source of stress for the patient. 
He does not believe the patient would kill herself but feels she 
could "accidentally walk in front of a truck" due to poor 
judgment.

Brief Hospital Course:
PSYCHIATRIC:
Patient was admitted on ___. Upon initial meeting with the 
team she reported that she has been increasingly stressed over 
the last month because her boyfriend of ___ years, “___”, with 
whom she lives, has been having his friend, ___, stay with 
them. This has been extremely stressful because, ___ spends 
most of his time walking around the apartment naked and asking 
her for sex. Importantly, despite always feeling uncomfortable 
in her home, she denied ever feeling unsafe. As a result of this 
difficult social situation patient turned to alcohol as means to 
cope and had been drinking heavily everyday for the last 1 to 2 
months, and also smoked crack for the first time in several 
years the night that she was admitted to the hospital. Patient 
denies that she was ever suicidal, but reports that she “needed 
a rest” and knew that she had to come in to the hospital for 
that reason. It appears that her recent relapse into substances 
and her chaotic living environment were the main causes of her 
mood symptoms of increased irritability and prominent insomnia. 
Given that her irritability, impulsivity, and difficulties with 
sleep were currently her most concerning symptoms she was 
started on quetiapine qhs. Which she had tolerated well in the 
past. The patient tolerated the quetiapine well, and found it to 
be efficacious for improving her sleep, decreasing her lability, 
and improving her mood overall. Throughout her time on the unit 
the patient was future oriented and denied having any thoughts 
of suicide. She also denied having any homicidal thoughts 
towards ___ or others. Towards the end of her admission the 
patient was denying any significant feelings of depression, 
denied any feelings of hopelessness, and was expressing her plan 
to go stay with her brother in ___ as a means to avoid the 
stress of her chaotic living situation with her boyfriend. She 
was also looking forward to getting things in order for her 
section 8 housing and to return to work. 

MEDICAL:
Patient was unable to quantify how much she was actually 
drinking, as she was simply drinking whatever she could get her 
hands on. She was on a ___ protocol throughout the first few 
days of her admission, however, she consistently scored zero on 
this measure and it was eventually discontinued once she was no 
longer at risk for complications from alcohol withdrawal. She 
declined outpatient treatment for her substance abuse and at 
time of discharge appeared competent to make this decision. She 
was willing to continue to follow up with an outpaitent 
therapist to continue to develop additional coping skills so she 
would not relapse into drinkin 

BEHAVIORAL (including group and milieu):
Patient was in good behavioral control and appropriate in the 
milieu throughout this admission. Patient was maintained on 15 
minute checks throughout as there were no acute safety concerns 
for the patient while on the locked unit. The patient also 
attended groups regularly, and was typically an active 
participant.

PSYCHOSOCIAL:
The patient has a long history of past sexual and physical 
abuse, and prior to her admission here she was once again living 
in a chaotic situation with her previously abusive boyfriend and 
his house guest who often walks around the apartment naked and 
asks her for sex. Despite noting that she often finds it 
extremely stressful to have to endure in this environment she 
denied any fear for her physical safety at this time and denied 
any recent physical or sexual abuse. Given her long history of 
past abuse, a consultation was requested with the ___ 
Violence Prevention and Recovery, who met with the patient and 
in addition to providing her with a least of resources for DV 
services in the community and their own contact information. 
As discharge was approaching the patient worked with social work 
in order to make arrangements so that she could temporarily go 
live with her brother in ___ while working to get things in 
order for her to apply for section 8 housing. The patient has a 
long history of returning to her abusive living situation and 
this concern was discussed with the patient and her social 
supports (brother and boss). She had the capacity to make 
decisions about her living situation at time of discharge. When 
overwhelemed she remains helpseeking and is knowledgeable about 
her resources.
