Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
long term EEG monitoring
 
History of Present Illness:
Mr. ___ is a ___ right-handed man with epilepsy secondary 
to TBI suffered in ___.  His typical seizures consist of 
bilateral arm extension, progressing to GTCS and fecal 
incontinence.  He has a post-ictal period lasting from 20min to 
2 or more hours during which he is minimally responsive.  After 
each seizure he has severe regression in his progress post-TBI: 
he becomes nearly aphasic, his R. hemiplegia returns, and his 
memory of household details (e.g., location of bathroom) is 
severely impaired.  This period lasts ___.  Since he 
initiated Keppra his seizure control has been improved, with one 
breakthrough in the context of a febrile viral illness.  He 
continues to have premonitory symptoms without progression to 
convulsion.  He describes these in his broken and halting 
speech: "Just... feeling.  Very... know is coming.  Very soon.  
Something bad."  These auras have lessened since his latest 
increase in Keppra, from 500 to 750mg BID.  He averages 1 
seizure every several months, though he has had siezure-free 
periods of up to 10 months.  His last seizure occurred in a 
cluster ___ months ago.  This admission for LTM is prompted 
not by the frequency or severity of his seizures, but by the 
intensity of his post-ictal
regression.  ___ and his family state emphatically that they 
desire resection of his seizure focus.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:

History of Present Illness:
Mr. ___ is a ___ previously
right handed man with a medically refractory seizure disorder
after a severe open head trauma in ___.

He has been admitted twice recently.  Once for transition from
Keppra for Vimpat - ___ - ___.  Keppra "took him to a
dark, dark place, like he was the devil", his mother tells us. 
She felt that Keppra was affecting his mood.  He was discharged
home with only one subclinical electographic seizure with Vimpat
as replacement for Keppra, remaining on prior doses of Trileptal
and Zonegran. 

He represented after a cluster of events in the context of
vomiting after taking medications on ___ via ___,
staying until ___.  It was felt that nausea was caused by 
the
medications, likely Vimpat, that this resulted in vomiting and 
he
then seized owing to lower AED levels.  There were no events
during this admission.  Of note, he needed to take the Vimpat at
bed time and the other meds a little earlier to tolerate all
medications in the evening, his mother explains.  He is now
tolerating medications well and she thinks that they could now
all be given together.

He had one complex partial (semiologic type 1 below) event
immediately after discharge on the ___, then another 
unwitnessed
event on the ___.  On this occasion he seemed
particularly dreamy with slower than usual speech, only saying
yes.  He also came downstairs with only his socks on - 
apparently
completely unlike this typically well-shod young man.  

Today he was sitting eating lunch with an adjustable table.  His
mother heard loud sounds from the kitchen and ran to see both
arms and legs with convulsive movements and a rattling lunch
table in the living room.  The seizure lasted for five minutes
and spontaneously broke, after which he was difficult to arouse. 

All limbs were moving, his head was back and moving from side to
side.  The onset was not witnessed, but this seems more akin to
his generalized events and his family feel convinced owing to
only being out of the room briefly and there being a food bolus
in his mouth.  They called EMS, lay him on his side - he ejected
the bolus.  EMS took him to ___ after
discussion with our epilepsy service where he was given 1 mg
Ativan then transferred to ___.  

At ___ he is sleepy and his mother noted that his urine here
was green and cloudy.  Neurology was consulted for readmission 
to
our epilepsy service, as suggested by Dr. ___.

 

He has seizures of three broad types:
1. Focal events.  These are characterized by a visage of
perplexity, then left head version, sometimes with prolonged
staring.  These will sometimes generalize.  The last witnessed
seizure of this type was on the ___.  These are his
most common seizure. 
2. He apparently has generalized events without focal signs or
staring to begin, as perhaps with today.  For this he has
previously had an aura, but this is not typical.  The last
generalized seizure was before Keppra was stopped in ___ (per Dr. ___, but his mother today is not sure). 
This was as a cluster of three seizures with two unwitnessed and
of unclear semiology.
3. There may also be some subclinical events as witnessed during
the first of his ___ admission.  

Medications that he has taken and failed:
Keppra - Mother and Father did not like - felt that mood worse
Dilantin - Allergy - rash
Presently taking:
Zonisamide (present), lacosamide (present), oxcarbazepine.
Has not tried: 
Depakote, Lamictal, Carbamazepine, per his mother's recollection
(prior notes not checked). 

 
Past Medical History:
He has hypercholesterolemia as well as a history of the above
head injury - he was driving, lost control, spun and had an open
head injury with a wooden pole directly injuring the left
hemisphere, damaging the left temporal, posterior frontal,
parietal lobe, as well as basal ganglia and dorsal thalamus. 
Seizures began about one year later. 

1. MVA s/p craniotomy in ___ and skull repair in ___
2. Epilepsy
3. Hypercholesterolemia
 
Social History:
___
Family History:
Mother ___ yo, hypercholesterolemia, htn, asthma.
Father ___ yo, hypercholetsrolemia, htn, DM. 
No history of epilepsy

 
Physical Exam:
Admission Exam:
Vitals: 98.6 F, 74 BPM, 131/77 mmHg, 16 breaths, 99% RA

He is lying on his right side in his pajamas sleeping.  He only
stirs to very loud voice or moving his hands or legs, etc.  He 
is
well groomed with short cropped hair.  His mouth is moist, there
is no discharge around nose and ears appear normal.  His lung
sounds are vesicular laterally and his heart sounds dual without
murmur.  His abdomen is soft and non-tender and bowel sounds are
present.  

He is sleeping, but makes good eye contact on waking and closes
his eyes again, despite stimulation of hands after about ___
seconds.  He says, in his typical dysarthric voice, that he is
"Fine." when asked.  He said nothing else.  He blinks to threat
from both sides.  

His pupils are symmetrical and reactive, ~ 5 - 3 mm.  Eyes are
conjugate and follow the examiner to both sides.  The face is
near symmetric with increased excursion of the mouth on the left
when showing his teeth.  His palate and tongue are midline and
shrug full.  

He could not be coached to participate in examination, but moves
both arms and grimaces to gentle nail squeeze and looks annoyed
to foot tickle bilaterally.  His right arm is straight, extensor
and quite spastic, his left arm is supple, his right leg is also
spastic with clonus at the ankle - not now sustained as before,
perhaps given Ativan.  Reflexes are brisk on the right,
particularly in the leg, with an upgoing toe on the right and
downgoing on the left.

EEG ___:
IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal continuous VEEG recording due to 
continuous focal delta slowing in the left frontal region which, 
at times, become rhythmic with embedded sharp waves, as above. 
These findings are consistent with focal cortical dysfunction 
and potential epileptogenic area. There is accentuated moderate 
beta activity in the left fronto-central areas indicative of a 
breach artifact due to skull defect. The background activity is 
slow suggestive of mild encephalopathy. There are no clinical or 
electrographic seizures captured during this study. 

EEG ___:
IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal continuous VEEG recording due to 
continuous focal slowing and accentuated moderate beta activity 
in the left frontal area indicative of a focal cortical and 
subcortical dysfunction with a breach artifact due to skull 
defect. The background activity is slow suggestive of mild 
encephalopathy. There are frequent prolonged runs of high 
amplitude rhythmic delta activity in the left frontal region, 
often with embedded left frontal sharp waves, (LRDA+S) 
indicative of high focal epileptogenicity. There are no definite 
clinical or electrographic seizures captured during this study. 
An abnormal cardiac rhythm with apparent P waves but alternating 
morphology wide QRS complex is frequently seen on one lead EKG. 
A further evaluation with 12 lead EKG will help in confirming 
the diagnosis. 

EEG ___: IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal 24 continuous EEG 
recording due to 30 electrographic seizures captured arising 
from left frontal lateralized rhythmic delta activity (LRDA) as 
noted above. There are frequent high amplitude rhythmic delta 
activity, often sharply contoured in the left frontal region, 
often with embedded left frontal sharp waves, (LRDA+S) 
indicative of high focal epileptogenicity. The background is 
disorganized and slow with additional continuous focal slowing 
and accentuated moderate beta activity in the left frontal area. 
These findings are indicative of a mild to moderate 
encephalopathy with additional, focal cerebral dysfunction with 
a breach artifact due to skull defect in the left frontal area. 
Abnormal cardiac rhythm with frequently changing QRS morphology 
likely due to intermittent right bundle branch block is seen on 
one lead EKG.

EEG ___: IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal video-EEG 
monitoring session because of frequent (16) electrographic 
seizures arising from the left frontal region. These have no 
clear clinical correlate on video. The seizures arise from an 
area of continuous focal slowing and breach artifact in the left 
frontal region. These findings are indicative of an 
epileptogenic focal structural lesion in the left frontal 
region. Background activity is slow bilaterally, much worse on 
the left. The electrographic seizures stop after administration 
of intravenous lorazepam around 2 ___. Compared to the prior 
day's recording, electrographic seizures cease after 
approximately 2 ___, but there is no other significant change. 
Incidental note is made of intermittent right bundle branch 
block in a single EKG channel. 

EEG ___: report pending
 

CXR: The lungs are clear without infiltrate.  There is some 
crowding at 
the bases, but no definite consolidation.  There is no effusion. 
 Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are normal. 

ECG: Sinus rhythm. Right bundle-branch block. Compared to the 
previous tracing  of ___ right bundle-branch block is seen 
on the current tracing which may reflect a higher heart rate. 
Other findings are similar. 

TTE:
The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. Left 
ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and regional/global 
systolic function are normal (LVEF >55%). Right ventricular 
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The diameters of 
aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels are normal. The 
aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good 
leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic 
regurgitation. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with 
trivial mitral regurgitation. The estimated pulmonary artery 
systolic pressure is normal. There is no pericardial effusion. 
IMPRESSION: Normal global and regional biventricular systolic 
function. No clinically-significant valvular disease seen.  

Ictal SPECT:
IMPRESSION: Greater perfusion in the right temporal lobe. 
Suggest correlation with an interictal study. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
The patient has a history of refractory epilepsy due to 
traumatic brain injury and was admitted because of a prolonged 
seizure. No clear trigger was identified, his infectious workup 
regarding labs, urine analysis and chest xray was normal. 

#Neuro:
His initial EEG recording was indicative of high focal 
epileptogenicity. We initially started him on valpoic acid and 
tapered off the lacosamide, since it had recently been started 
and not provided good seizure control. Valproic acids was 
increased to 750mg BID. Despite high valproic acids levels >90, 
this not only failed to improve his EEG, but increased rhythmic 
delta activity and made the patient less attentive, which was 
suspicious for subclinical seizures. We then switched valproic 
acid to clobazam, which improved his EEG and his ___ 
condition. His clobazam dose should be increased to ___ on 
___.

#CV
A RBBB was noted on his ECG, which had intermittently been 
present on prior ECGs. Cardiology was consulted and recommended 
a TTE to exclude a structural abnormality, which was normal. 
They felt the RBBB was likely rate-dependent and does not 
reequire any further workup or intervention.

Mental Status: Clear and coherent.

 
Discharge Instructions:
Dear ___, 
you were admitted because of seizures. We initially started you 
on valproic acid (Depakote), which made you less responsive and 
your EEG looked worse. We then started clobazam and tapered down 
the valproic acid, after which your condition improved. We 
stopped the lacosamide (Vimpat), which had been started recently 
and did provide adequate seizure control.
Your antiepileptic medications are now as follows:
START clobazam 10mg BID, should be increased to 10mg-20mg on 
___
KEEP zonisamide 600mg qHS
KEEP oxcarbazepine 1500mg BID 
In addition, your vitamin D levels were found to be low, which 
increases your risk of having a fracture. We started a 
supplementation with:
Vitamin D 50,000IE twice per week for another 7 weeks, then 
continue with Vitamin D 1000IE daily
It was a pleasure taking care of you during this 
hospitalization.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

 
History of Present Illness:
Mr. ___ is a ___ man with drug refractory post traumatic
epilepsy secondary to a motor vehicle accident that he sustained
in ___. He is well known to the epilepsy service and is 
followed
by Dr. ___ in the Comprehensive Epilepsy
Program at ___. His mother accompanies him and provides a
history. 

She explains that he was recently discharged from the hospital
after transitioning from lacosamide to clobazam. The lacosamide
had been initiated one day prior to his most recent admission 
and
had to be discontinued because apparently he had  "a big grand
mal" the next night. She explains that while he was in house, he
had no difficulties with gait as he was mostly in bed all day
long. However, after he went home, the seizures were under
excellent control with clobazam, but his gait has been
"completely off". She explains that this is a young man who was
previously able to climb up and down the stairs in his three
story home with grocery bags in each arm. While his previous
brain injury may have caused some right arm weakness, he
certainly never had any gait difficulties. He has always been
insistent on being independent and has never had any falls or
problems with balance. After being discharged on clobazam, he 
has
been quite unsteady on his feet. On numerous occasions, she has
had to run up the stairs after she heard a loud thud from his
room, to find lying on his side. She has had to support him 
while
he wakes up in the middle of the night to urinate, as he is not
able to stand and urinate without "getting wobbly" or woozy. He
has not had vertigo or headaches. He has been able to eat and
drink without difficulty. There has been no nausea or vomitting.
She also reports that the problem tends to persist throughout 
the
day, and not just after his medications. She did report however
that he has still tended to do well in his physical therapy
sessions, but has not been doing well at home. 

___ and his mother met ___ of the epilepsy
clinics just five days ago, where his clobazam 10AM, 20mg ___ was
reduced to 10mg AM and 15mg ___. This however, has not made a
significant difference in his gait instability. 

During his most recent hospitalization in ___, he was
admitted to the epilepsy monitoring unit following a prolonged
seizure. No clear infectious or metabolic trigger was 
identified.
He was maintained on EEG monitoring which revealed frequent 
focal
seizures. Lacosamide was weaned off and he was switched to
valproic acid. But this appeared to cause an encephalopathic
state with increased delta activity and inattention. The VPA was
then switched to clobazam. A RBBB was noted on his EKG, and
cardiology was consulted and they felt that this abnormality was
likely benign variant and required no further interventions or
work up. 

Review of systems is negative unless stated above. 

 
Past Medical History:
Regarding his epilepsy history, we know that his seizures began
at age ___, approximately one year after a severe traumatic brain
injury during a motor vehicle accident.  During the MVA, a 
wooden
post was driven into his skull causing extensive left hemisphere
damage.  He required a left craniotomy and was hospitalized for
more than one month and then prolonged rehabilitation.  He was
left with a significant left hemiparesis, aphasia, and cognitive
deficits, as well as difficult to control epilepsy.  His mother
reports that his longest seizure-free interval has been
approximately one year.  More recently, he has had several
admissions for medication changes, then breakthrough prolonged
seizures or prolonged postictal changes.  He was initially
admitted in early ___ for a switch from Keppra (severe
behavioral side effects) to Vimpat, then was readmitted in mid
___ after a breakthrough seizure in the setting of 
vomiting.
His typical seizures consist of an initial confused look, then
head version to the left with staring, sometimes with secondary
generalization.  Many of his seizures are quite prolonged,
lasting up to 30 minutes. He also has generalized tonic-clonic
seizures without clear focal onset, as well as some subclinical
seizures seen on EEG monitoring.  He has failed multiple
antiepileptic medications, including Keppra (behavioral 
changes),
Dilantin (allergy), zonisamide, lacosamide.  Many of his 
seizures
are precipitated by infection or hyponatremia. Other medical
history includes hypercholesterolemia, for which he is 
maintained
on a statin medication.

vital signs were 98.5, HR 79, BP
119/66, RR 16, 100% RA. ___ is a young man who was largely
cooperative and pleasant. He had a somewhat childish demeanour
and made little by way of eye contact. He spoke slowly in mostly
moans and groans and throughout the interview, he kept pointing
at his mother and telling her to "shush". His head had sequelae
of prior left hemicraniectomy. No conjunctival changes were
noted. Mucous membranes were moist and oropharynx is clear of
lesions. Neck was supple without masses or thyromegaly. Chest
examination revealed regular heart sounds without murmurs, and
lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally. Belly was soft
without focal tenderness, and extremities were warm and well
perfused. Skin examination showed no rashes or lesions.  

Neurologically, the patient is awake and alert. He could tell me
his name. He responded slowly and in short sentences. He was
anomic to low frequency objects. He followed simple commands, 
but
there was quite a bit of perseveration. He was quite dysarthric. 


Cranial nerve examination revealed round, equal and reactive
pupils. Extraocular movements were full with left beating
horizontal nystagmus on leftward gaze. There was a subtle left
facial droop. Hearing was grossly intact. Palate elevates
symmetrically, and the strength of trapezii and SCMs was ___
bilaterally. Tongue was midline and without fasiculations.
Strength examination showed a right spastic hemiparesis with
hyperreflexia. The right arm is flexed at baseline, as was the
right wrist. Wrist and finger extension were ___ on the right.
The right lower extremity was also weak at both the gastroc and
TA muscle groups (___): he was quite weak in both ankle
dorsiflexion and plantarflexion. The remainder of the motor
examination was unremarkable. The right toe was upgoing. He had
normal sensation to light touch and cold sensation over both 
legs
and feet. When asked to walk, ___ walked with both feet
externally rotated and displayed a steppage-like gait on the
right > left. His stride length was short. He was not able to
tandem, and his posture was somewhat stooped.

region with ex vacuo dilatation of the left lateral ventricle.  
Overall, no 
significant interval change is seen.  There is no evidence of 
hemorrhage, mass 
effect, or midline shift seen.  There are no new areas of loss 
of gray-white 
matter differentiation seen.  The right ventricle is normal in 
size.  There is 
a craniectomy on the left. 
  
IMPRESSION:  No significant interval change in appearance of 
left temporal 
encephalomalacia and ex vacuo dilatation of the left lateral 
ventricle 
compared to the prior CT of ___.  No significant interval 
abnormalities 
are seen. 

EEG ___:
FINDINGS:  
PUSHBUTTONS: No events were identified. 
AUTOMATED INTERICTAL EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY: A focal area of 
persistent ___ 
Hz delta frequency slowing was seen in the left anterior 
quadrant. 
The background was moderate amplitude ___ Hz mixed theta and 
alpha frequency 
activity. 
AUTOMATED SPIKE DETECTION: A few events were captured for sharp 
mixed 
frequency activity seen in the left temporal region consistent 
with breach 
artifact. 
AUTOMATED SEIZURE DETECTION: This algorithm captured no events. 
SLEEP: Some periods of slow wave sleep were seen, but most were 
seen in the 
daytime/morning hours. During the nighttime hours, the patient 
had extended 
periods of apparent wakefulness. 
CARDIAC MONITOR: Revealed a generally regular rhythm with 
average rate of 72 
bpm. 
IMPRESSION: This 24 hour EEG telemetry did not capture any 
epileptiform 
activity. A persistent area of focal slowing was seen in the 
left anterior 
quadrant with a breach rhythm. Background activity was somewhat 
slower and 
more variable than average. 
  
 
INTERPRETED BY: ___. 

EEG ___:
FINDINGS:  
PUSHBUTTONS: One event was identified at 6:12:25 in which the 
patient is 
talking to a nurse because he is unhappy about not being allowed 
out of bed. 
During this event, he shakes his left hand/arm for a couple of 
seconds and 
says that he is having a seizure. Except for movement artifact, 
no other EEG 
or EKG changes are seen prior to or following this event. 
AUTOMATED INTERICTAL EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY: A persistent area of 
___ Hz delta 
frequency focal slowing was seen in the left anterior quadrant. 
Background 
activity consisted of mixed ___ Hz theta frequency activity. 
AUTOMATED SPIKE DETECTION: A few events were captured for sharp 
mixed 
frequency activity in the left anterior quadrant consistent with 
breach 
artifact. 
AUTOMATED SEIZURE DETECTION: Three events were captured, all for 
chewing 
artifact. 
SLEEP: Some periods of slow wave sleep were seen, primarily 
during the 
daytime hours. 
CARDIAC MONITOR: The majority of this tracing demonstrated a 
generally 
regular rhythm with an average rate of 78 bpm. 
IMPRESSION: This 24 hour EEG telemetry captured no epileptiform 
activity. An 
area of persistent focal slowing in the left anterior quadrant, 
consistent 
with an area of subcortical dysfunction. Otherwise, background 
activity is 
slower than average and somewhat disorganized. The single 
clinical event 
identified was not associated with any epileptiform activity. 
  
 
INTERPRETED BY: ___. 

EEG ___:
FINDINGS:  
PUSHBUTTONS: None were activated during this 24 hour period. 
AUTOMATED INTERICTAL EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY: In the fully awake 
state, a well- 
formed mixed ___ Hz theta and alpha frequency background was 
seen. A 
persistent area of focal slowing was present in the left 
anterior quadrant 
with superimposed low voltage beta activity and embedded sharp 
features 
(consistent with breach artifact). 
AUTOMATED SPIKE DETECTION: This algorithm identified waveforms 
in the left 
frontal region that represented sharpening of the beta breach 
activity. No 
spikes or sharp waves were seen. 
AUTOMATED SEIZURE DETECTION: This algorithm captured five 
events, all 
associated with chewing or breach artifact. 
SLEEP: Some periods of slow wave sleep were seen in the 
overnight hours. 
CARDIAC MONITOR: Revealed a generally regular rhythm with 
average rate of 72 
bpm. 
IMPRESSION: This 24 hour EEG telemetry did not identify any 
epileptiform 
activity. As seen on previous days' recordings, a slow 
background was 
present with a focal area of persistent slowing in the left 
anterior quadrant 
with an associated breach rhythm. 
  
 
INTERPRETED BY: ___. 

EEG ___:
FINDINGS:  
PUSHBUTTONS: No events were identified. 
AUTOMATED INTERICTAL EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY: In the fully awake 
state, a 
moderately well-organized ___ Hz theta frequency background was 
seen. A 
focal area of ___ Hz delta frequency slowing was seen in the 
left anterior 
quadrant broadly. 
AUTOMATED SPIKE DETECTION: This algorithm captured a single 
event associated 
with electrode artifact. 
AUTOMATED SEIZURE DETECTION: Two events were captured by this 
algorithm; both 
were associated with electrode artifact. 
SLEEP: No periods of slow wave sleep were seen during this 
recording. 
CARDIAC MONITOR: Revealed a generally regular rhythm with 
average rate of 66 
bpm. 
IMPRESSION: This continuous EEG recording did not capture any 
epileptiform 
activity.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear ___, 
you were admitted because of concerns about your walking, and 
worries about an increased frequency of falls. We were concerned 
that this happened due to either seizure activity or medication 
side effects. We monitored you on EEG, an did not see any 
seizures. We decreased one of your seizure medications 
(oxcarbazepine aka Trileptal), without any adverse effects. This 
was done after consulting your outpatient neurologist, Dr. 
___. You walked several times with the doctors, 
nurses, and also with our physical therapist, and we did not 
observe any unstable gait or falling. At this point, we believe 
you are safe to go home on the lower dose of oxcarbazepine 
(Trileptal).

Your antiepileptic medications are now as follows:
CONTINUE clobazam (Onfi) 10mg in the morning and 15 mg in the 
evening.
CONTINUE zonisamide (Zonegran) 600mg in the evening
CONTINUE oxcarbazepine (Trileptal) at the lower dose of 1200 mg 
twice daily

It was a pleasure taking care of you during this 
hospitalization.

History of Present Illness:
This is a ___ year old ___ man with epilepsy secondary to TBI who 
was recently admitted for change of medications and 
characterization of events. Briefly, he began having seizures 
about ___ year after a MVA where a wooden post was driven through 
the left side of his skull with residual R hemiplegia, cognitive

does not have an aura and loses consciousness with these 
episodes. His mom and sister describe them as R upper extremity 
convulsions with head turning. Seizure duration is typically 
___ min. Oftentimes he experiences a second seizure ___ hours 
later. These seizures typically occur every few months but have
not happened in the past year and a half.  

2. He has occasional generalized tonic clonic seizures, the most 
recent of which was in ___, with tongue biting and one episode 
of urine incontinence. The longest seizure free interval has 
been a year and a half (___). There is history of 
physical injury secondary to falls when he seizes. Postictal 
symptoms include confusion and lethargy lasting 12 hours. For

admission which demonstrated some abnormalities, but no specific 
seizure activity, including those events which were identified 
as concerning for seizure activity through push-button 
activation.

We modified your seizure medications over the course of this 
admission to include the medication Vimpat, while tapering off 
the medication Keppra.  This change should give you good control 
of your seizure activity without the same increase in mood 
changes.

History of Present Illness:
___ yo man with past medical history of TBI with resulting R
hemiparesis and refractory secondary epilepsy was transferred
from ___ for breakthrough seizures.  He initially
presented to their emergency room today after a seizure at home. 

His father heard noise that sounded like him kicking against the
door.  They called an ambulance.  The shaking seemed to have
lasted <2minutes but they couldn't view most of the seizure
because of difficulty getting the door open. After the door was
opened, we was found to be shaking his right arm and laying on
his left side.  They are unsure if he was shaking his legs. 
There was no urinary incontinence.  He was groggy afterward.  He
was then brought by ambulance to ___ where a second
generalized convulsion occurred lasting ___ minutes (different
times recorded in the records).  He was given Ativan IV 2mg at
10:05,10:10 and 10:15 after which the seizure stopped.  He was
then transferred to ___ for further management

for 2 weeks.  During this time, according to his mother, he will
need reteaching of all his ADLs and even needs to relearn his
favorite food.  He was admitted last at ___ in ___ because
following seizures, he still had not returned to his baseline
after a full month.  He was feeling "crackles in his brain"  He
was found during that admission on LTM to have subclinical
seizures.  He was weaned of Keppra and his Zonegram was
increased.

with refractory secondary epilepsy and right hemiparesis who 
presents with two generalized convulsions within a couple hours 
with no obvious trigger such as infection, missed doses, sleep 
deprivation, or alcohol intake.  In the past, he has been 
allergic to Dilantin and had significant cognitive slowing with 
Keppra.  He currently is on high doses of Trileptal and Zonegram 
and he will most likely need a third agent added to obtain 
better control.  He has missed his morning doses because of 
seizures and will need to have IV benzodiazepine coverage until 
a third agent is decided.  

Hospital Course:  Mr. ___ was admitted to the epilepsy 
service from ___. He was monitored on video-EEG which 
showed frequent bifrontal delta slowing but no epiletiform 
discharges.  He was initially managed with his home doses of 
zonegran (100mg qAM, 600mg qHS) and trileptal (1500mg BID) and 
placed on IV ativan.  There was no clear precipitant for Mr. 
___ seizures, given he had been compliant on medication 
and had no clear infectious cause or other provoking state.  He 
was therefore started on a third anti-epileptic agent, Keppra, 
which was slowly titrated up.  He was able to tolerate 1000mg 
BID of Keppra prior to discharge and this can be titrated up 
further outpatient if he has any further breakthrough seizures.  
He did have one one clear electrographic seizure - R posterior 
quadrant- 3.5 Hz, lasting 20 seconds without clinical change on 
___, but no other remarkable events.  He will receive a ___ 
evaluation at home and see Dr. ___ in 4 weeks for 
follow up.    

At discharge, his exam was alert and oriented.  Naming and 
comprehension continued to be slow at time, but per mother at 
baseline. PERRL. EOMI. Face with mild R facial droop. RUE ___.

Discharge Instructions:
Mr. ___,
You were transferred to our hospital because you had two 
seizures on full doses of your medications without any missed 
doses or infection to explain the breakthrough.  Your current 
AEDs were maximized and it was decided that a third agent was 
needed to gain control of your seizures.  You were placed on LTM 
monitoring to look for subclinical seizures.  You were placed on 
Keppra and the dose was slowly increased to 1000mg twice daily.  
You should continue to take your other seizure medications 
including trileptal 1500mg twice daily and Zonegran 100mg in AM 
and 600mg at night.
