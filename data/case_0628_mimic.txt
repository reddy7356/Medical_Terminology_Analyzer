___: chest x-ray:

No acute cardiopulmonary process.

___:  CT of the head:

Probable small subarachnoid hemorrhage in the right temporal 
lobe along the sylvian fissure. 

___:  cat scan of the chest:

.  Bilobed hypodensity at the junction of hepatic segments I, 
VI, and VII 
measuring 6.6 x 4.3 x 4.7 cm has features more suggestive of a 
hemangioma 
rather than laceration, though this is incompletely assessed on 
this 
single-phase study.  Benignity is supported by lack of adjacent 
capsular 
defect or subcapsular/perihepatic hematoma.  If there is any 
clinical 
suspicion for bleed, an MRI could be considered for more 
definitive diagnosis. 
2.  A hyperenhancing focus along the periphery of segment 
VII/VIII does not have an associated hematoma, likely a small 
perfusional shunt. 
3.  Markedly enlarged and heterogeneous left thyroid lobe 
warrants correlation with thyroid function tests and US 
evaluation for possible FNA. 

___:  right knee x-ray:

No fracture or dislocation. 
  
Mild degenerative changes within the lower lumbar spine and at 
the right knee.

___:  right femur:

 No fracture or dislocation.

___: right knee:

No fracture or dislocation. 
  
Mild degenerative changes within the lower lumbar spine and at 
the right knee.

___:  thyroid US:

 -Large dominant heterogenous nodule within the mid/ lower pole 
of left 
thyroid, approximately 7 cm, with small internal cystic 
elements. A 
nonemergent ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration is 
recommended, when 
clinically appropriate. 

  

  

  

 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ Year old male with unknown PMHx presented s/p pedestrian 
struck and ETOH as trauma team activation. Evaluation for 
+change in MS and ___ pain. CT head showed right temporal lobe 
subarachnoid hemorrhage, FAST ultrasound was negative for free 
fluid, Patient was given Haldol for agitation and CT imaging and 
labs were obtained. CT a/p positive for grade II hepatic 
laceration. Neuro surgery consult obtained for SAH and patient 
admitted to TSICU for SAH and liver laceration. Patient remained 
unchanged and hemodynamically stable in the ED, ETOH labs +292, 
GCS 14. The patient was started in CIWA scale and given keppra 
prophylaxis with close neurological and blood pressure 
monitoring and serial hematocrits.  
the patient remained stable and there were signs of bleeding or 
neurological change. His mental status was clear and he showed 
no signs of alcohol withdrawal. Tertiary exam was negative for 
any additional injuries. The patient was transferred out of the 
TSICU to the floor in good condition. He was seen by ___ and OT 
and cleared for home without services. His diet was advanced and 
he was tolerating a regular diet without any difficulties. He 
was voiding adequate amounts of urine without difficulty. He was 
encouraged to mobilize out of bed and ambulate as tolerated, 
which she was able to do independently. His pain level was 
routinely assessed and well controlled at discharge with an oral 
regimen as needed. Neck CT revealed an incidental finding of an 
enlarged thyroid, so a thyroid US and a thyroid FNA was 
obtained. The patient was discharged on HD#3. The patient 
received discharge teaching and follow-up instructions with 
understanding verbalized and agreement with the discharge plan. 
He had follow-up with neurology and to see a surgeon to discuss 
a thyroidectomy as an outpatient.
