Brief Hospital Course:
Pt has a chronic psychotic illness, and presented with with 
agitation, paranoia, and overall decompensation in the context 
of a recent move from ___ to ___ and medication non-adherence. 
Given his agitation and inability to care for himself at time of 
admission, even in a supportive environment such as ___, 
suggested that he met Section XII criteria for involuntary psych 
hospitalization. Pt was agreeable to hospitalization and was 
admitted to Deac 4.  Hospital course by problem:

1.  Schizoaffective d/o:  Pt was initially continued on his 
outpatient medication regimen of ziprasidone, buproprion, and 
venlafaxine.  After psychopharmacologic evaluation, his 
medication regimen was adjusted.  Ziprasidone was increased to 
80mg BID, buproprion was discontinued, and venlafaxine was 
increased to 225mg daily (XR).  These changes were made to 
optimize benefits of antipsychotic medication by boosting to a 
therapeutic dose, and to simplify antidepressant regimen by 
changing to one agent at a therapeutic dose.  He continued to 
display some intermittent paranoia, but remained largely 
organized and in good behavioral control.  

2.  Anxiety:  Pt was continued on his home dose of lorazepam at 
bedtime, and also was given prn doses of lorazepam up to 4 times 
daily for management of anxiety.  In addition to medication, he 
participated in coping skills groups and worked with 
occupational therapy to develop good coping mechanisms to help 
him deal with anxiety.  He continued to focus somewhat on 
somatic worries (high blood pressure, abnormal prostate exam), 
but was able to use coping skills to help with these worries and 
keep them from interfereing in daily functioning.  At the time 
of discharge, pt was quite concerned with having difficulty with 
anxiety and not having easy access to prn medications after 
discharge.  We adjusted his lorazepam regimen to 1mg BID plus 
0.5mg BID prn anxiety.

3.  Prostatitis:  Pt was continued on a 10-day course of 
ciprofloxacin as directed in ___ emergency room for 
dysuria and a diagnosis of likely prostatitis.  As he did have 
an abnormal prostate exam in the ED per St. E's records, he 
should have urology follow-up.  

4.  Legal: ___
5.  Outpatient follow-up:  As pt very recently moved to the 
___ area from his long-term residence in ___.  For that 
reason, he does not have any relationships here with mental 
health (or general health) care providers.  He is being 
discharged to ___ in ___, where he will have the 
support of structured group home and day treatment program.  He 
will also be followed by an affiliated psychiatrist there, Dr. 
___.  He will have an intake at ___ in ___ 
for individual therapy.  Finally, he will need to use the 
find-a-doctor line for a PCP and get referral to urology from 
there.  In addition, a D___ application is being filed to 
potentially get access for adult services in the ___ area for 
this patient in the future.
