Kidney biopsy ___: final read not done, but per report 
concern for mild acute rejection

Micro:

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ is a ___ gentleman with a history of ESRD 
stage V secondary to FSGS now s/p living unrelated kidney 
transplant (___) who was admitted to the transplant unit 
from clinic for evaluation of elevated creatinine in the setting 
of subtherapeutic MMF dosing, found to have acute mild cellular 
rejection s/p IV steroids.

#Acute Kidney Injury: 
Patient has a history of CKD ___ FSGS s/p living unrelated 
kidney transplant (___) presented from clinic with Cr of 
2.5, up from baseline of 2.0. He had been taking mycophenolate 
mofetil 500 mg BID instead of 1000 mg BID, prompting concern for 
rejection. Urinalysis and urine culture both negative. He was 
given IV fluids with improvement of Cr. Additionally, a renal 
biopsy showed mild acute cellular rejection, so he completed 
three days of high dose IV methylprednisolone, and will be 
discharged on an oral steroid taper. The patient had hematuria 
following the biopsy that resolved without further 
interventions. 
- Steroid taper (start date ___: prednisone 60mg x 3days, 
40mg x 3days, 20mg x 5days, 15mg x 5 days, 10mg x 5 days, 5mg 
indefinitely 

#ESRD S/p Living Unrelated Renal Transplant: LURT done on 
___. He presented on mycophenolate mofetil 500 mg BID 
instead of 1000 mg BID. Upon arrival MMF was increased to 1000 
mg BID and tacrolimus was increased to 6mg BID after tacrolimus 
level returned low. He will be discharged on the prednisone 
taper as above for rejection.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,

Why you were admitted to the hsopital:
- You were admitted because a lab test (creatinine) showed your 
kidney function had worsened
- This was concerning for transplant rejection

What we did while you were here: 
- We gave you intravenous fluids to help improve your kidney 
function
- We also took a biopsy of your kidney transplant, which showed 
mild acute rejection
- We increased mycophenolate mofetil from 500 mg to 1000 mg 
twice daily
- We increased your tacrolimus to 6 mg twice daily
- We gave you three days of IV steroids for the rejection and 
sent you home on oral steroids

What you need to do once you return home:
- Continue taking tacrolimus 6 mg twice daily
- Continue taking mycophenolate mofetil 1000 mg twice daily
- Continue Nystatin until your follow-up in transplant clinic. 
Continue Bactrim and valacyclovir. 
- Take the prednisone 60 mg for 3 days, 40 mg for 3 days, 20 mg 
for 5 days, 15 mg for 5 days, 10 mg for 5 days, then 5 mg daily 
after that

It was a pleasure taking care of you.
