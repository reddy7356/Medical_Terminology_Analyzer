Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ was brought to the Operating Room on ___ where 
the patient underwent 23 mm ___ mechanical 
valve aortic valve replacement and also left leg vein harvesting 
but target vessels were too small for coronary artery bypass 
grafting.  Overall the patient tolerated the procedure well and 
post-operatively was transferred to the CVICU in stable 
condition for recovery and invasive monitoring.  
POD 1 found the patient extubated, alert and oriented and 
breathing comfortably in sinus rhythm and 1st degree AV block on 
the telemetry.  The patient was neurologically intact and 
hemodynamically stable, weaned from inotropic support.  Beta 
blocker was initiated and the patient was gently diuresed toward 
the preoperative weight.  His creatinine peaked at 2.1 from 
baseline 1.4.  The patient was transferred to the telemetry 
floor for further recovery.  Chest tubes and pacing wires were 
discontinued without complication.  Warfarin was initiated for 
mechanical valve.   The patient was evaluated by the physical 
therapy service for assistance with strength and mobility.  By 
the time of discharge on POD 4 the patient was ambulating with 
assistance, the wound was healing and pain was controlled with 
oral analgesics.  The patient was discharged to ___ at 
___ in good condition with appropriate follow up 
instructions.

No fresh or retained blood visualized.
Otherwise normal colonoscopy to cecum

LIVER ULTRASOUND ___
Limited views show or no abnormalities in the liver parenchyma 
and a patent portal vein.  Persistent right pleural effusion.  
No ascites. 

CTA ABDOMEN AND PELVIS ___. No evidence of intraluminal contrast extravasation. 
2. Ground-glass opacities in the left lower lobe raise the 
possibility of 
aspiration or developing infection. 
3. Moderate superior mesenteric artery stenosis. 
4. Nodular hepatic contour consistent with cirrhosis. 
5. Cholelithiasis without cholecystitis. 
6. Moderate nonhemorrhagic right pleural effusion with adjacent 
relaxation 
atelectasis. 

ECHO (___)
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). 
A bioprosthetic aortic valve prosthesis is present. The aortic 
valve prosthesis leaflets appear to move normally. A 
paravalvular jet of mild aortic regurgitation in non coronary 
cusp is seen. No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic 
valve. No aortic valve abscess is seen. The mitral valve 
leaflets are structurally normal. Moderate to severe (3+) mitral 
regurgitation is seen. There is no abscess of the tricuspid 
valve. Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. 
There is no pericardial effusion. 

IMPRESSION: Paravalvular jet of mild aortic regurgitation in 
noncoronary cusp is seen. Moderate to severe tricuspid 
regurgitation. Moderate to severe mitral regurgitation. 

ECHO (___)
The left atrium is elongated. The right atrium is moderately 
dilated. There is moderate symmetric left ventricular 
hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. 
Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal. Overall left 
ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>60%). A coronary 
fistula into the right ventricle is suggested in clip 54 given 
flow thoughout the cardiac cycle. A tiny muscular VSD is 
possible but less likley given diastolic flow and presence of 
high right heart pressures. The right ventricular free wall is 
hypertrophied. The right ventricular cavity is moderately 
dilated with moderate global free wall hypokinesis. The 
ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic arch is mildly 
dilated. A mechanical aortic valve prosthesis is present. The 
aortic valve prosthesis appears well seated, with normal 
leaflet/disc motion and transvalvular gradients. Mild (1+) 
aortic regurgitation is seen. [The amount of regurgitation 
present is probably normal for this prosthetic aortic valve.] 
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no 
mitral valve prolapse. At least moderate mitral regurgitation 
[2+] is seen. The mechanism is not clear. The posterior leaflet 
does appear somehwat restricted in the absence of myocardial 
disease subtending the papillary muscle. Severe [4+] tricuspid 
regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery 
systolic hypertension. [In the setting of at least moderate to 
severe tricuspid regurgitation, the estimated pulmonary artery 
systolic pressure may be underestimated due to a very high right 
atrial pressure.] There is no pericardial effusion. 

IMPRESSION: Right ventricular hypertrophy with moderately 
dilated cavity and moderate hypokinesis. Severe tricuspid 
regurgitation. At least moderate mitral regurgitation. Suspected 
coronary artery fistula (see above). At least moderate pulmonary 
hypertension. Normally mechanical aortic valve gradients. 

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of ___ the 
mitral regurgitation is slightly reduced. The tricuspid 
regurgitation is similar, but the volume overload on the left 
ventricle/septal interaction is nearly absent consistent with 
interval unloading of the right ventricle. 

RUQUS (___)
1. Cirrhotic liver, without evidence of focal lesion or ascites. 
 Spleen not
seen due to limited patient mobility.
2. Patent main and right portal veins.
3. Cholelithiasis without evidence of acute cholecystitis.
4. Right pleural effusion.

Abdominal US (___)
1. Patent hepatic vasculature with bidirectional flow within the 
portal veins.
2. Cirrhotic liver morphology with no focal lesions identified.
3. Trace ascites and a right pleural effusion.
4. Cholelithiasis without evidence of cholecystitis.

ECHO (___)

The left atrium is elongated. The right atrium is markedly 
dilated. The estimated right atrial pressure is at least 15 
mmHg. There is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. 
Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal. Overall left 
ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Tissue 
Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling 
pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). The right ventricular cavity is 
moderately dilated with moderate global free wall hypokinesis. 
[Intrinsic right ventricular systolic function is likely more 
depressed given the severity of tricuspid regurgitation.] There 
is abnormal septal motion/position consistent with right 
ventricular pressure/volume overload. A mechanical aortic valve 
prosthesis is present with normal transvalvular gradients. The 
leaflets are not well seen. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is 
seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is 
no mitral valve prolapse. Moderate to severe (3+) mitral 
regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly 
thickened. The tricuspid valve leaflets fail to fully coapt. 
Severe [4+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. [In the setting of 
at least moderate to severe tricuspid regurgitation, the 
estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure may be 
underestimated due to a very high right atrial pressure.] There 
is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion. A right pleural 
effusion is present. 

IMPRESSION: Moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with 
normal systolic function. Dilated right ventricle with moderate 
free wall hypokinesis and severe tricuspid regurgitation. 
Significant pulmonary hypertension. Well seated mechanical 
aortic valve with normal transvalvular gradients. Mild aortic 
regurgitation. Moderate to severe mitral regurgitation. 

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of ___, 
the degree of tricuspid and mitral regurgitation is 
significantly worse. 

CT Head WO Contrast (___): No acute intracranial 
abnormality, specifically no acute intracranial hemorrhage.

CXR (___) Moderate right and small left pleural effusions.

CTA ___

IMPRESSION:
 
1. No evidence of intraluminal contrast extravasation.

relaxation
atelectasis.

MRCP ___
IMPRESSION:
 
1. No evidence of biliary obstruction.

cystic lesions.

TTE ___
Conclusions
The left atrium is mildly dilated. The right atrium is 
moderately dilated. There is moderate symmetric left ventricular 
hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. The 
right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with normal free wall 
contractility. There is abnormal septal motion/position 
consistent with right ventricular pressure/volume overload. A

prosthesis appears well seated, with normal leaflet/disc motion 
and transvalvular gradients. Mild to moderate paravalvular 
(___) aortic regurgitation is seen in the 8 o'clock position. 
[Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity of aortic regurgitation 
may be significantly UNDERestimated.] The mitral valve leaflets 
are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. An 
eccentric, posteriorly directed jet of Moderate (2+) mitral 
regurgitation is seen. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is 
seen. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ is a ___ male with history of severe aortic 
stenosis status post mechanical aortic valve replacement in 
___, with recent episode of aortic valve endocarditis with 
subsequent dehiscence, paroxysmal Afib/flutter, hypertension, 
hyperlipidemia, OSA, CHF with preserved EF, likely cardiac 
cirrhosis, who presented with syncope, admitted for acute on 
chronic HFpEF exacerbation, with hospital course complicated by 
CCU admission due to rising lactate with concern for low flow 
state, status post CRRT, with subsequent intermittent HD. 

Patient presented with acute syncopal episode, along with 
worsening several day history of dyspnea and missed one HD 
session prior to admission. Initially with elevated proBNP of 
16,113 and CXR showing moderate right and small left pleural 
effusion. Was found to be significantly volume overloaded with 
acute on chronic HFpEF exacerbation. Patient initially underwent 
HD for volume management. Elevated lactate on admission was 
thought to be from volume overload from CHF exacerbation and 
from missing HD session, along with delayed hepatic and renal 
clearance.  Hospital course was complicated by up-trending 
lactate despite HD to a peak of 5.5.  Patient was subsequently 
cool on exam with concern for low flow state, although BPs were 
low-normal. He was subsequently transferred to the CCU for 
urgent CRRT. He completed CRRT for 48 hours with removal of 
300cc/hr with lactate down-trending to 2.5.  TTE was performed 
on ___ to evaluate bioprosthetic aortic valve.  It was thought 
that possible plug from previous paravalvular leak repair may be 
obstructing the RCA which may have contributed to proximal RCA 
ischemia leading to a NSTEMI per below, however ultimately this 
was felt less likely to be contributing in a significant way to 
his heart failure symptoms.

He was stabilized from a volume standpoint after CRRT in the 
ICU, and was transferred to the F3 floor for further 
optimization of medications and hopeful discharge to rehab 
facility.

The patient began to have increasing amounts of diarrhea 
(attributed to lactulose), however C diff was checked and was 
negative. On the morning on ___ patient began to have melena 
that transitioned to BRBPR around 1800. MAPS were in the low ___ 
to ___. Case was discussed with hepatology who were on board and 
recommended IV PPI, CTX and octreotide. He had more maroon 
stools, requiring multiple transfusions, had a upper and lower 
endoscopy, without clear source but did show grade I varices (1 
cord). He required pressor support initially with phenylephrine, 
which was weaned off starting ___.

He was transferred back to the general cardiology floor on ___ 
after stabilization. However, he was felt to be volume 
overloaded and in addition to ___ HD sessions was continued on 
UF on non-HD days.
He started to approach euvolemia. 
However, on ___ started to notice uptrend in 
his LFTs. His Alk phos peaked around 3000-4000, and his 
bilirubin increased as well. Liver was consulted, and 
recommended biopsy which was not performed due to risk for 
bleeding and patient's tenuous clinical status. His amiodarone 
and statin were discontinued, however his LFTs were persistently 
abnormal though his AST/ALT did eventually downtrend.

The week of ___, he developed relative hypotension, 
triggering overnight for SBPs in 70-80s. At HD sessions fluid 
removal was limited ___ hypotension.
The AM of ___, Mr. ___ again became hypotensive to the 
60-70s systolic, and felt symptomatic and dizzy. At that time, 
discussion was held with his wife and daughter about his 
multiple organ system failure, and ultimately it was decided 
that they would focus on comfort measures rather than 
upescalating care. 

He passed away with his family at his bedside on ___.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,

It was a pleasure caring for you at ___ 
___. 

You were admitted with worsening heart failure. While you were 
here, we gave you diuretics, which are medications to help you 
urinate. First, we did this through your IV and then we switched 
you to an oral regimen. 

At discharge, you weighed 303 pounds. It is very important that 
you weigh yourself every morning before getting dressed and 
after going to the bathroom. Call your doctors if your ___ 
goes up by more than 3 lbs ___ 1 day or more than 5 lbs ___ 3 
days.

You were also found to have an infection of your toe. You were

URINE CULTURE (Final ___:    <10,000 organisms/ml. 

___ CXR:
In comparison with the study of ___, the costophrenic angles 
are not well seen posteriorly, suggesting small pleural 
effusions. Continued enlargement of the cardiac silhouette 
without definite vascular congestion or acute focal pneumonia. 
On the lateral view, the hemidiaphragms are now sharply seen and 
no evidence of acute pneumonia is appreciated.

___ CXR: 
FINDINGS:  
Lungs are well expanded.  Mediastinal contours, hila, and 
moderate 
cardiomegaly are unchanged from ___.  Subtle opacity 
silhouetting the 
right hemidiaphragm seen better on lateral view is more apparent 
than on ___.  No pulmonary edema, pleural effusion, or 
pneumothorax. 
IMPRESSION:   
Subtle right lower lobe opacity could represent pneumonia. 

___ Left Foot film:
In comparison with the study of ___, there is little overall 
change.  The phalanges of the fifth digit show no evidence of 
cortical erosion or internal destruction to spot 
radiographically suggest osteomyelitis.  However, plain 
radiographs are poor for this purpose, it and if there is 
serious clinical concern for osteomyelitis, MRI could be 
obtained.
Again there is an old healed fracture of the midshaft of the 
fifth metatarsal. There is extensive soft tissue prominence 
about the first MTP joint with what appeared to be periarticular 
erosions, raising the possibility of gout.  In the appropriate 
setting, it would be difficult to exclude the possibility of 
infection. Tissue swelling dorsally.  Large inferior and 
posterior calcaneal spurs are again seen.

___ Arterial Extremities:
Findings Doppler evaluation was performed of both lower 
extremity arterial
systems.  All waveforms are triphasic bilaterally from the 
femoral to the
dorsalis pedis artery.  The right ankle-brachial index is 1.27.  
The left is 1.11.  Pulse volume recordings are normal.
Impression: normal arterial Doppler study of both lower 
extremities at rest

___ ECHO:
The estimated right atrial pressure is ___ mmHg. There is mild 
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size 
and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%). Right 
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The 
aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened. There is severe 
aortic valve stenosis (valve area <1.0cm2; <0.6 cm2/m2). Mild 
(1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve appears 
structurally normal with mild [1+] mitral regurgitation. There 
is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is a 
trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Very suboptimal image quality. Severe aortic valve 
stenosis. Mild aortic regurgitation. Mild symmetric left 
ventricular hypertrophy with preserved regional and global 
biventricular systolic function.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of ___, 
the calculated aortic valve area is now lower - due to the lower 
LVOT VTI/peak velocity on the current study.
If clinically indicated, a cardiac MRI may be better able to 
assess the severity of aortic stenosis and biventricular 
systolic function.  

___. difficile DNA amplification assay (Final

Brief Hospital Course:
___ year old male with history of diastolic CHF (EF > 55%), CAD 
with moderate AS with plan for AVR/CABG in ___, atrial 
fibrillation on xarelto, and hypertension presenting with 
dyspnea, weight gain, and elevated BNP with diastolic CHF 
exacerbation. 

# Diastolic CHF exacerbation:
Patient presented with weight gain (up 25lbs from dry weight), 
dyspnea, orthopnea, elevated BNP of 2454 (previously 1224) found 
to have pulmonary edema and bilateral pleural effusions. The 
likely etiology was thought to be new-onset Atrial fibrillation 
with need for AVR. Was treated with Lasix IV, lasix drip, and 
metolazone before being transitioned to po Lasix 100mg BID 
(discharge dosing). Discharge Cr was 1.2 and weight was 128.4 
kg. On exam, he appeared euvolemic, with normal JVP, clear 
lungs, and no edema.

# Moderate AS/CAD with plan for AVR/CABG:
Catheterization on ___ showed an aortic valve gradient of 50 
mm with a calculated valve area of 0.7 cm2. Patient with 
elevated troponin in setting of CKD as well, possibly demand due 
to CHF exacerbation. Since admission, he has remained chest pain 
free. Given his condition, Cardiac surgery team was consulted 
for an expedited valve repair. Vascular surgery was also 
consulted to evaluate any possible necrosis of his toe, which 
did not reveal any osteomyelitis. Xarelto was stopped for 
surgery. He was scheduled for surgery on ___. He was 
continued on daily aspirin 81mg, and his simvastatin 20mg was 
changed to atorvastatin 40 mg. Nitro was avoided, given that he 
was preload dependent.

# Atrial fibrillation CHADS2VASC score 2:
Mr. ___ initially presented in atrial fibrillation. He was 
not on rate-controlling agent at admission, but was on Xarelto. 
He was initially started on metoprolol 12.5mg, which was 
uptitrated to 25mg. He occasionally had asymptomatic episodes of 
bradycardia to rates of 30's which lasted for a few minutes; 
however, we did not discontinue his metoprolol because it was 
felt that the reason for his reduced heart rates was likely 
sleep apnea, for which he refused to use CPAP. Xarelto was 
briefly stopped ___ and he was started on heparin ___ for a 
planned CABG/AVR. However, the surgical date was postponed to 
___ therefore, he was restarted on Xarelto, with instructions 
to take last dose on ___ for a five-day washout prior to 
surgery.

#C. diff colitis and gluteal cleft fungal rash:
He initially developed a leukocytosis with a neutrophilic 
predominance, with minimal and non-productive cough, but was 
afebrile. U/A was unremarkable, Urine culture grew Klebsiella, 
but this was thought unlikely to be a UTI as he had no symptoms. 
An initial chest xray showed a possible right lower lobe 
consolidation and he received empiric treatment for Healthcare 
Associated Pneumonia with Vancmyycin/Cefepime. However, C. 
difficile antigen test was positive (he has never had diarrhea, 
however), so IV antibiotics were stopped and  he was started on 
14 day course of oral vancomycin (last day ___. During this 
admission, he was found to have a fungal infection in his 
gluteal cleft with skin breakdown. Wound care nursing was 
consulted and he was treated with miconazole cream for 2 weeks, 
twice daily (last day ___.

#Cardiorenal Syndrome:
He initially presented to the hospital with a Cr of 1.6. It was 
initially thought to be an acute on chronic kidney injury; 
however, given adequate diuresis with lasix IV, drip, 
metolazone, and lasix 100 PO BID, his Cr at discharge was 1.2.

#Anxiety/Mania:
Aripiprazole was increased to 4mg in discussion with outpatient 
psychiatrist.

Transitional Issues:
====================
# Cardiac medications: Aspirin 81mg, Atorvastatin 80mg, Lasix 
100 mg BID, metoprolol XL 50mg, Rivaroxaban (Xarelto) 20 mg.
# Weight at discharge 128.4 kg.
# Please consider repeat BMP and CBC at follow-up appointment to 
evaluate renal function and ensure resolution of leukocytosis.
# Please check patient's fungal rash to ensure improvement. He 
will be on miconazole 2% cream for 14-days (last dose ___
# Patient scheduled for CABG/AVR/MAZE procedure on ___. Please 
remind him that last dose of Xarelto should be on ___ prior to 
surgery.
# Patient continuing treatment for C. difficile colitis, 14 day 
course (last dose ___. He will need a repeat C.diff test once 
he is done with his treatment course to be done as an outpatient 
and faxed Attn: ___ Cardiac Surgery at ___.

History of Present Illness:
___ year-old right-handed man with a PMH of ADHD, HTN, HLD, OSA 
and glucose intolerance who was brought to the ED by his wife 
for concern of new onset mania.

This history is obtained from both the ___ records as well as 
the patient. The patient denies most of the details regarding 
his recent behavior in ___ and his wife as left the ED "to go 
home and sleep" per the patient. 

Per the patient, he has been in his USOH until earlier this 
week. He states that he has been staying up late and been "up 
for the last two days" for work. He states that he has been 
completing a deadline and has to work long hours because his 
colleagues are based in ___. When asked to explain what 
type of work he is doing, he answers that he works for ___ 
___ and then starts to explain that he worked for a 
prior ___. His answers are  persistently tangential and 
it is difficult to get him to describe any recent events or 
symptoms aside from "my wife misled me to   bring me to the ED". 
When asked if he has a sense of the issues his wife was 
concerned about, he  reiterates that he had to stay up for work 
and that's why he is "flaky". 

Per the ___ notes from Psychiatry, his wife has noted a change 
in his behavior over the last 3 weeks. The patient is described 
as being  increasingly "impulsive" and "inappropriate", sending 
inappropriate  emails, "rambling" and engaging in excessive 
spending. He was reportedly awake all night and she found him 
sleeping on the couch after taking "melatonin". His co-worker 
expressed concern to his wife and they decided to take him to 
see
his PCP. There he was again described as tangential and referred 
to the ED for further investigation. 

Additionally, per the notes, his wife noted a few episodes of 
"word-finding difficulty today" that lasted only a few minutes. 
He has also reportedly had a few stumbling episodes recently. 

The patients refutes most of these details, as described above, 
explaining again that he has been working hard and that is why 
he has had to work. He does not think that anything he has done 
recently could be described as impulsive or inappropriate. He 
does not recall any falls, but says that his R leg is  sometimes 
stiff from a prior fusion. 

When asked directly, he does recall that he has had difficulty 
with his speech. It is difficult to get him to specify if this 
problem started today or if it was present prior. Most 
consistently, he answers that it started only today. He explains 
that "they call it pressured speech" but "it seems like I cant 
get the words together". During the interview, he has 2 episodes 
of difficulty with speech. 

The first occurred at the beginning of the interview, when the 
patient did not answer his name on introduction. I asked him 
several questions and he appeared confused, answering ___ 
intermittently. When asked repeated specific questions, he was 
unable to produce fluent answers and was silent or saying single 
consonants. Intermittently, there were briefly preserved phrases
such as "I totally disagree" but these responses do not appear 
to be related to the questions I am posing to him. There is no 
facial droop, weakness  dysarthria or gaze preference during the 
episode. It resolved spontaneously after about ___ minutes and 
he was immediately fluent. His speech was normal. He was not 
amnesic to the event but had difficulty describing it. He was 
able to
clarify that "I can't get the words out" but also noted "I can't 
think of the word". He states that he has "never experienced 
this before". There was a second episode lasting about ___ 
minutes later during the interview with the same 
characteristics. 

A similar episode was described during the psychiatry 
evaluation, During review of family hx and social hx, I asked pt 
if his mother had any psychiatric illness. Pt was silent for a 
short time then tried to speak but could not produce full words 
("ah... I wo...). He looked upset at the time, but not tearful. 
I then asked pt about unrelated topics; he was able to respond 
somewhat
better, but still with only brief ___ word responses, and with 
difficultly producing those. These symptoms lasted approximately 
___ minutes."

He denied any aura prior to the episode and denied olfactory, 
auditory or tactile hallucinations. He has had a "floater" in 
the left eye for several years but has not noticed a change in 
this recently. He denies sensory changes or weakness, numbness 
or tingling. He feels that if he "stops and meditates" his 
speech will improve. 

ROS:
The pt denied headache, loss of vision, blurred vision, 
diplopia, dysarthria, dysphagia, lightheadedness, vertigo, 
tinnitus or hearing difficulty. Denied difficulties 
comprehending speech.  Denied focal weakness, numbness, 
paraesthesia. No bowel or bladder incontinence or retention. 
Denied difficulty with gait. The pt denied recent fever or 
chills.  No night sweats or recent
weight loss or gain. Denied cough, shortness of breath.  Denied 
chest pain or tightness, palpitations.  Denied nausea, vomiting, 
diarrhea, constipation or abdominal pain.  No recent change in 
bowel or bladder habits.  No dysuria.  Denied arthralgias or 
myalgias. Denied rash.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ is a ___ year-old right handed man with a PMH of 
OSA, ADHD on Adderal for > ___ years, HTN, HLD, glucose 
intolerance and prior LOC in the context of trauma who was 
brought to the ED for concern for new onset mania.

1) Mania with ? Speech arrest-
Etiology of mania remains unclear. There is potential for 
adderral abuse as an inciting factor in context of sleep 
deprivation and other social stressors. The patient's neurologic 
examination in the ED was notable for intermittent difficulty in 
producing speech. He was admitted to the neurology service for 
evaluation of secondary causes of mania and speech disturbance. 
EEG was normal in the awake and drowsy states. MRI of the brain 
with gadolinium was unremarkable. The patient's adderall was 
rapidly taperd to off over 24 hours. A lumber puncture was 
attempted at the bedside in both lateral decubitis and upright 
positions without success. He may have an LP under fluoroscopy 
if deemed clinically necessary. The patient remained on a 1:1 
sitter for safety reasons. Repeated examinations on subsequent 
hospital days were notable for persistent tangential thinking 
and lack of insight. The patient was transferred to ________ . 

2) Elevated LFT's-
Unclear etiology at present. Admission AST and ALT are similar 
to those from ___. Consider NASH, alcoholic hepatitis, 
or occult infectious hepatitis. Further evaluation should 
proceed on an outpatient basis.

The patient and his wife state his upper legs have felt quite 
weak over the last month, but within the last week he couldn't 
even get himself out of the chair. He is unable to lie flat due 
to shortness of breath, and so has been sleeping upright in a 
recliner. Denies PND. He is incredibly short of breath on 
minimal exertion. He also has had increased bilateral lower

light headed when walking. He endorses weight loss as well as a 
dry cough x2 months. He has also had diarrhea x2 days that is 
very dark in color. He had one episode of ___ but 
was able to make it to the toilet. Denies abdominal pain but has 
occasional episodes of nausea, no emesis. Denies fevers, chills, 
night sweats. He states he has not improved since his AVR in 
___. He denies CP, palpitations. His wife did not feel that 
the patient was safe at home (unable to ambulate, weak), and so 
she brought him to the hospital. Additionally, his wife feels 
that he recently slurs his words, and he says that he feels 
mentally cloudy lately.

STUDIES/IMAGES:
====================
___ PA/LATERAL CXR: FINDINGS: 
There is a small right pleural effusion, increased in size since 
prior, and likely trace left pleural effusion as well.  Lungs 
are otherwise clear without edema or consolidation.  Cardiac 
silhouette is enlarged but similar compared to prior.  Median 
sternotomy wires and prosthetic valve are again noted.  No acute 
osseous abnormalities.
 
IMPRESSION: Small right and trace left pleural effusions.

___ TRANSTHORACIC ECHOCARDIOGRAM:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. The right atrium is 
moderately dilated. There is mild symmetric left ventricular 
hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Due to 
suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality 
cannot be fully excluded. Overall left ventricular systolic 
function is normal (LVEF = 70%). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests 
an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). 
The right ventricular free wall is hypertrophied. The right 
ventricular cavity is moderately dilated with normal free wall 
contractility. [Intrinsic right ventricular systolic function is 
likely more depressed given the severity of tricuspid 
regurgitation.] The diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending 
and arch levels are normal. A bileaflet aortic valve prosthesis 
is present. The transaortic gradient is normal for this 
prosthesis. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral 
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate to severe (3+) 
mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are 
mildly thickened. Severe [4+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. 
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. [In 
the setting of at least moderate to severe tricuspid 
regurgitation, the estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure 
may be underestimated due to a very high right atrial pressure.] 
There is no pericardial effusion. 

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of ___, 
mitral regurgitation and tricuspid regurgitation are increased, 
but the technically suboptimal nature of both studies precludes 
definitive comparison. 
 
___ PORTABLE CXR:
IMPRESSION:  Comparison to ___.  Mild increase in 
severity of a ___ small right pleural effusion.  Newly 
occurred parenchymal opacity at the right lung bases, 
potentially suggestive of pneumonia in the appropriate clinical 
setting.  Stable moderate cardiomegaly.  Stable correct 
alignment of the sternal wires.

___ CT ABDOMEN/PELVIS:
IMPRESSION:
1. Nodular liver contour, likely representing cirrhosis.  There 
is no evidence of portal hypertension such as ascites or 
splenomegaly.
2. Aside from a millimetric hypodensity in the left lobe of the 
liver that is too small to characterize but likely represents a 
cyst, no focal liver lesion is identified.
3. Decompressed gallbladder containing a few small stones.  Mild 
pericholecystic fat stranding is likely reactive to adjacent 
liver disease.
4. Moderate nonhemorrhagic right pleural effusion with adjacent 
subsegmental atelectasis.

___ TRANSESOPHAGEAL ECHOCARDIOGRAM:
Difficult esophageal intubation requiring laryngoscopic guidance 
by anesthesia to pass the pediatric probe. No visual evidence of 
trauma during laryngoscopic evaluation, but evidence of 
pharyngeal trauma during intubation with mild bloody secretions 
on probe. No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in 
the body of the left atrium or left atrial appendage. A 
mechanical aortic valve prosthesis is present (23mm ___ 
___ mechanical valve). The aortic valve prosthesis 
leaflets appear to move normally. No masses or vegetations are 
seen on the aortic valve. Aortic regurgitation seen is normal 
for the prosthesis. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly 
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. No mass or 
vegetation is seen on the mitral valve. Moderate to severe (3+) 
mitral regurgitation is seen. There is no pericardial effusion. 

IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality (had to use pediatric probe 
because of difficulties with esophageal intubation). No valvular 
vegetations visualized. Moderate to severe mitral regurgitation. 
Well seated mechanical aortic valve replacement is present with 
normal leaflet motion. 

___ CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST:
COMPARISON:  MRI brain ___
FINDINGS: 
There is no evidence of acute large territory infarction, 
hemorrhage, edema, or mass effect.  Unchanged right dilated 
perivascular space in the lentiform nucleus.  There is 
periventricular and subcortical white matter hypodensity, which 
is nonspecific, but likely represents chronic microvascular 
ischemic changes.  The ventricles and sulci are prominent, 
consistent with involutional changes.  Incidentally noted 
calcifications of the bilateral carotid siphons. No osseous 
abnormalities seen. The paranasal sinuses, mastoid air cells, 
and middle ear cavities are clear. The orbits are unremarkable.
 
IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial abnormality.  Specifically, no 
evidence of intracranial hemorrhage.

___ EGD -
Normal mucosa with no varices
Erythema and petechiae in the body and fundus compatible with 
PHG
Otherwise normal EGD to third part of the duodenum

___ RHC:
RA 20, PA 65/24, PA MEAN 41, PCW 25, CI 1.99 (while on Dopamine)

___ CXR IMPRESSION
___ catheter is seen with tip projecting perhaps more 
laterally/distal
than the expected location of the interlobular pulmonary artery, 
however this
is likely exacerbated by patient rotation. Clinical correlation 
recommended. 
Repeat frontal radiograph could be confirmed if clinically 
warranted.
 
Apparent slight worsening of pulmonary edema and ___ 
pleural effusion
which may be exacerbated by patient positioning.

___ ECHO
The left atrium is moderately dilated. Left ventricular wall 
thicknesses and cavity size are normal. Regional left 
ventricular wall motion is normal. Left ventricular systolic 
function is hyperdynamic (biplane EF 82%). Right ventricular 
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The ascending 
aorta is mildly dilated. A mechanical aortic valve prosthesis is 
present. The aortic valve prosthesis appears well seated, with 
normal disc motion and transvalvular gradients. Mild (1+) aortic 
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are 
structurally normal. No masses or vegetations are seen on the 
mitral valve, but cannot be fully excluded due to suboptimal 
image quality. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. A 
tricuspid valve annuloplasty ring is present. Moderate to severe 
[3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is moderate 
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. [In the setting of at 
least moderate to severe tricuspid regurgitation, the estimated 
pulmonary artery systolic pressure may be underestimated due to 
a very high right atrial pressure.] There is a 
trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion. 

 IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Well seated, normal 
functioning mechanical aortic valve prosthesis with normal 
gradient and mild aortic regurgitation. Moderate mitral 
regurgitation. Moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. 
Mildly dilated ascending aorta. 

 Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of ___, 
the findings are similar. 

 If clinically indicated, a ___ TEE would be superior for 
assessment of the aortic valve and mitral valve morphology. 

 CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: 
 Based on ___ AHA endocarditis prophylaxis recommendations, the 
echo findings indicate prophylaxis IS recommended. Clinical 
decisions regarding the need for prophylaxis should be based on 
clinical and echocardiographic data.  

___ ___
IMPRESSION:  
  
No evidence of deep venous thrombosis in the right or left lower 
extremity 
veins. 

___ RUQUS
IMPRESSION:  
  
1. The liver is coarsened and nodular in echotexture consistent 
with 
cirrhosis, but without concerning focal lesions. There is no 
evidence of 
portal venous thrombosis. 
2. Cholelithiasis without gallbladder wall thickening. 
3. Large ___ pleural effusion. 

___ ECHO
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. Overall 
left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right 
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. There 
are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. A 
mechanical aortic valve prosthesis is present. The aortic valve 
prosthesis appears to be partially dehisced with normal disc 
motion. A paravalvular jet of at least moderate aortic 
regurgitation located in right coronary cusp is seen. No masses 
or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve. The aortic 
regurgitation jet is eccentric. The mitral valve leaflets are 
mildly thickened. No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral 
valve. Moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen. Due 
to the eccentric nature of the regurgitant jet, its severity may 
be significantly underestimated (Coanda effect). Moderate [2+] 
tricuspid regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid regurgitation jet 
is eccentric and may be underestimated. There is no pericardial 
effusion. 

 IMPRESSION: There is an evidence of partial dehiscence of 
aortic valve and at least moderate paravalvular regurgitation 
located in right aortic cusp. Moderate to severe mitral 
regurgitation. Moderate tricuspid regurgitation.

 Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of ___ 
the jet of paravalvular aortic regurgitation has not been 
previosuly visualized.  

___ Line placement CXR
IMPRESSION:  
  
Compared to the earlier same day examination, there has been 
placement of a left internal jugular approach dual lumen 
catheter with tip terminating in the mid to lower SVC, 
satisfactory.  There is no associated pneumothorax.  No other 
interval changes seen. 

___
Tunneled dialysis line CXR

FINDINGS:  
Patent right internal jugular vein.  Final fluoroscopic image 
showing tunneled hemodialysis catheter with tip terminating in 
the right atrium. 
  
IMPRESSION:  
Successful placement of a  19 cm ___ length tunneled 
dialysis line.  The tip of the catheter terminates in the right 
atrium. The catheter is ready for use.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,

You were admitted to ___ 
because you were feeling very weak and had difficulty breathing. 


What did we do while you were here?
===================================
- You were found to have a lot of extra fluid in your body, and 
so we treated you with an IV medication called Lasix to have you 
pee it out. 
- We also learned that you had blood in your stool, and so we 
started you on a medication to reduce stomach acid called 
Protonix.
- You were found to have an infection in your blood, as well as 
in your urine, and so we treated you with IV antibiotics. 
- You were treated in the cardiac intensive care unit after you 
a lot of blood in your stool and you became very drowsy - this 
was because your blood was too thin. 
- We measured the blood pressures in your heart - which showed 
that despite medications, your heart was not beating well enough 
for the rest of your body.  Because of this, you were 
transferred to the cardiac intensive care unit. 
- In the intensive care unit you received medication to help 
your heart beat
- We used a special ultrasound to look at your heart valves and 
found your aortic valve was very leaky, you were evaluated for 
surgery and eventually had a plug placed to stop the leak
- Your kidneys unfortunately stopped working correctly and you 
required dialysis to clean your blood. You had a catheter (large 
IV) placed in your right chest where you will hook up to the 
dialysis machine.
- You were given medications through your IV to help increase 
your blood pressure. These were eventually no longer needed and 
you were started on a medication called midodrine to increase 
your blood pressure.

What do you need to do when you go home?
========================================
  - It is very important that you take your midodrine to help 
keep your blood pressure up and amiodarone to help control your 
heart rhythm.
  - Please go to your scheduled appointment with your primary 
doctor, ___, and hemodialysis appointments.
  - Please go to hemodialysis on ___, and 
___
  - Weigh yourself everyday. If you gain more than 3 lbs, please 
call your doctor 
  - Please check your blood pressure everyday. If your blood 
pressure is lower than 85 over 55, please call your doctor.
  - If you have , please tell your primary doctor or go to the 
emergency room.

It was a pleasure taking care of you!

History of Present Illness:
___ year-old right-handed man with a PMH of ADHD, HTN, HLD, OSA 
and glucose intolerance who was brought to the ED by his wife 
for concern of new onset mania.

This history is obtained from both the ___ records as well as 
the patient. The patient denies most of the details regarding 
his recent behavior in ___ and his wife as left the ED "to go 
home and sleep" per the patient. 

Per the patient, he has been in his USOH until earlier this 
week. He states that he has been staying up late and been "up 
for the last two days" for work. He states that he has been 
completing a deadline and has to work long hours because his 
colleagues are based in ___. When asked to explain what 
type of work he is doing, he answers that he works for ___ 
___ and then starts to explain that he worked for a 
prior ___. His answers are  persistently tangential and 
it is difficult to get him to describe any recent events or 
symptoms aside from "my wife misled me to   bring me to the ED". 

When asked if he has a sense of the issues his wife was 
concerned about, he  reiterates that he had to stay up for work 
and that's why he is "flaky". 

Per the ___ notes from Psychiatry, his wife has noted a change 
in his behavior over the last 3 weeks. The patient is described 
as being  increasingly "impulsive" and "inappropriate", sending 
inappropriate  emails, "rambling" and engaging in excessive 
spending. He was reportedly awake all night and she found him 
sleeping on the couch after taking "melatonin". His co-worker 
expressed concern to his wife and they decided to take him to 
see
his PCP. There he was again described as tangential and referred 

to the ED for further investigation. 

Additionally, per the notes, his wife noted a few episodes of 
"word-finding difficulty today" that lasted only a few minutes. 
He has also reportedly had a few stumbling episodes recently. 

The patients refutes most of these details, as described above, 
explaining again that he has been working hard and that is why 
he has had to work. He does not think that anything he has done 
recently could be described as impulsive or inappropriate. He 
does not recall any falls, but says that his R leg is  sometimes 

stiff from a prior fusion. 

When asked directly, he does recall that he has had difficulty 
with his speech. It is difficult to get him to specify if this 
problem started today or if it was present prior. Most 
consistently, he answers that it started only today. He explains 

that "they call it pressured speech" but "it seems like I cant 
get the words together". During the interview, he has 2 episodes 

of difficulty with speech. 

The first occurred at the beginning of the interview, when the 
patient did not answer his name on introduction. I asked him 
several questions and he appeared confused, answering ___ 
intermittently. When asked repeated specific questions, he was 
unable to produce fluent answers and was silent or saying single 

consonants. Intermittently, there were briefly preserved phrases
such as "I totally disagree" but these responses do not appear 
to be related to the questions I am posing to him. There is no 
facial droop, weakness  dysarthria or gaze preference during the 

episode. It resolved spontaneously after about ___ minutes and 
he was immediately fluent. His speech was normal. He was not 
amnesic to the event but had difficulty describing it. He was 
able to
clarify that "I can't get the words out" but also noted "I can't 

think of the word". He states that he has "never experienced 
this before". There was a second episode lasting about ___ 
minutes later during the interview with the same 
characteristics. 

A similar episode was described during the psychiatry 
evaluation, During review of family hx and social hx, I asked pt 

if his mother had any psychiatric illness. Pt was silent for a 
short time then tried to speak but could not produce full words 
("ah... I wo...). He looked upset at the time, but not tearful. 
I then asked pt about unrelated topics; he was able to respond 
somewhat
better, but still with only brief ___ word responses, and with 
difficultly producing those. These symptoms lasted approximately 

___ minutes."

He denied any aura prior to the episode and denied olfactory, 
auditory or tactile hallucinations. He has had a "floater" in 
the left eye for several years but has not noticed a change in 
this recently. He denies sensory changes or weakness, numbness 
or tingling. He feels that if he "stops and meditates" his 
speech will improve. 

ROS:
The pt denied headache, loss of vision, blurred vision, 
diplopia, dysarthria, dysphagia, lightheadedness, vertigo, 
tinnitus or hearing difficulty. Denied difficulties 
comprehending speech.  Denied focal weakness, numbness, 
paraesthesia. No bowel or bladder incontinence or retention. 
Denied difficulty with gait. The pt denied recent fever or 
chills.  No night sweats or recent
weight loss or gain. Denied cough, shortness of breath.  Denied 
chest pain or tightness, palpitations.  Denied nausea, vomiting, 

diarrhea, constipation or abdominal pain.  No recent change in 
bowel or bladder habits.  No dysuria.  Denied arthralgias or 
myalgias. Denied rash.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ is a ___ year-old right handed man with a PMH of 
OSA, ADHD on Adderal for > ___ years, HTN, HLD, glucose 
intolerance and prior LOC in the context of trauma who was 
brought to the ED for concern for new onset mania.

1) Mania, NOS

Etiology of mania remains unclear. There is potential for 
adderral abuse as an inciting factor in context of sleep 
deprivation and other social stressors, however as per pt and 
his outpt psychiatrist's report, patient has no history of ever 
abusing his medications. The patient's neurologic examination in 
the ED was notable for intermittent difficulty in producing 
speech. He was admitted to the neurology service for 
evaluation of secondary causes of mania and speech disturbance. 
EEG was normal in the awake and drowsy states. MRI of the brain 
with gadolinium was unremarkable. The patient's adderall was 
rapidly tapered to off over 24 hours. A lumber puncture was 
attempted at the bedside in both lateral decubitis and upright 
positions without success. He may have an LP under fluoroscopy 
if deemed clinically necessary. The patient remained on a 1:1 
sitter for safety reasons. Repeated examinations on subsequent 
hospital days were notable for persistent tangential thinking 
and lack of insight. The patient was transferred to the 
inpatient psychiatry ward (Deac 4) and underwent improvement in 
his condition. By ___ upon interview, the patient was quite 
cooperative and displayed predominatly logical, linear thinking. 
Speech, did however, remain somewhat pressured, and the 
patient's recounting of the course leading up to his 
hospitalization was notable for fastidious attention to detail 
and lengthy, discursive recollections. Patient remained on 
___, was denied an emergency court hearing, and was 
amenable to taking 10 mg Aripiprazole on ___.

2) Elevated LFT's-
Unclear etiology at present. Admission AST and ALT are similar 
to those from ___. Consider NASH, alcoholic hepatitis, 

or occult infectious hepatitis. Further evaluation should 
proceed on an outpatient basis.
