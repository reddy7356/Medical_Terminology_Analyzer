Transthoracic Echocardiogram ___
The left atrial volume index is normal. There is mild symmetric 
left ventricular hypertrophy with a normal cavity size. There is 
normal regional and global left ventricular systolic function. 
Quantitative
biplane left ventricular ejection fraction is 67% (normal 
54-73%). There is no resting left ventricular outflow tract 
gradient. Tissue Doppler suggests a normal left ventricular 
filling pressure (PCWP less than 12mmHg). Normal right 
ventricular cavity size with normal free wall motion. The aortic 
sinus diameter is normal for gender with a normal ascending 
aorta diameter for gender. The aortic arch diameter is normal 
with a normal descending aorta diameter. There is no evidence 
for an aortic arch coarctation. The aortic valve leaflets (3) 
are mildly thickened. There is no aortic valve stenosis. There 
is mild [1+] aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are 
mildly thickened with no mitral valve prolapse. There is mild 
[1+] mitral regurgitation. The pulmonic valve leaflets are 
normal. The tricuspid valve leaflets appear structurally normal. 
There is mild [1+] tricuspid regurgitation. The estimated 
pulmonary artery systolic pressure is borderline elevated. There 
is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with 
normal cavity size and regional/global biventricular systolic 
function. Mild aortic regurgitation. Mild mitral regurgitation.

Transesophageal Echocardiogram ___
PRE-OPERATIVE STATE: Pre-operative assessment. Sinus rhythm.
Left Atrium (LA)/Pulmonary Veins: Normal LA size.
Right Atrium (RA)/Interatrial Septum/Inferior Vena Cava (IVC): 
Normal interatrial septum. No atrial septal defect by 2D/color 
flow Doppler.
Left Ventricle (LV): Normal cavity size. Normal regional & 
global systolic function
Right Ventricle (RV): Normal free wall motion.
Aorta: Mild sinus dilation. Mild ascending dilation. Normal arch 
diameter. Normal descending aorta diameter. No dissection. No 
ascending atheroma. Simple arch atheroma. Simple descending 
atheroma.
Aortic Valve: Thin/mobile (3) leaflets. No stenosis. Mild [1+] 
regurgitation. Central jet.
Mitral Valve: Mildly thickened leaflets. No stenosis. Mild [1+] 
regurgitation. Central jet.
Tricuspid Valve: Normal leaflets. Mild [1+] regurgitation.
Pericardium: No effusion.

POST-OP STATE: The post-procedure TEE was performed at 13:43:00. 
Atrial paced rhythm.
Left Ventricle: Similar to preoperative findings. Global 
ejection fraction is normal.
Right Ventricle: No change in systolic function.
Aorta: Intact. No dissection.
Aortic Valve: No change in aortic valve morphology from 
preoperative state. Unchanged gradient. No change in aortic 
regurgitation.
Mitral Valve: No change in mitral valve morphology from 
preoperative state. No change in valvular regurgitation from 
preoperative state.
Tricuspid Valve: No change in tricuspid valve morphology vs. 
preoperative state.

.
TTE CONCLUSION:
The left atrial volume index is normal. The right atrium is 
moderately enlarged. The estimated right
atrial pressure is >15mmHg. There is normal left ventricular 
wall thickness with a normal cavity size.
There is suboptimal image quality to assess regional left 
ventricular function. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal. The visually estimated left 
ventricular ejection fraction is 70%. There is
no resting left ventricular outflow tract gradient. Normal right 
ventricular cavity size with SEVERE
global free wall hypokinesis. Tricuspid annular plane systolic 
excursion (TAPSE) is depressed. Intrinsic
right ventricular systolic function is likely lower due to the 
severity of tricuspid regurgitation. There is
abnormal interventricular septal motion c/w right ventricular 
volume overload. The aortic sinus diameter
is normal for gender with a normal ascending aorta diameter for 
gender. The aortic arch diameter is
normal with a normal descending aorta diameter. The aortic valve 
leaflets (3) appear structurally normal.
There is no aortic valve stenosis. There is aortic regurgitation 
(not qualified). The mitral valve leaflets
appear structurally normal with no mitral valve prolapse. There 
is moderate [2+] mitral regurgitation.
The pulmonic valve leaflets are normal. The tricuspid valve 
leaflets appear structurally normal. There is
SEVERE [4+] tricuspid regurgitation. The estimated pulmonary 
artery systolic pressure is borderline
elevated. In the setting of at least moderate to severe 
tricuspid regurgitation, the pulmonary artery
systolic pressure may be UNDERestimated. There is no pericardial 
effusion.
IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Severe tricusid 
regurgitation. Severe right ventricular
systolic dysfunction.
Compared with the prior TTE (images reviewed) of ___ , 
severe tricuspid regurgitation and
severe right ventricular dysfunction now seen.
.
CXR PA LAT:
IMPRESSION:  
Comparison to ___.  The right internal jugular vein 
catheter has been removed.  Better seen on the lateral than on 
the frontal view are small bilateral pleural effusions, limited 
to the posterior aspect of the 
costophrenic sinuses.  No pulmonary edema.  Mild postoperative 
cardiomegaly.  No pneumonia.  Bandlike parenchymal opacity along 
the previous course of the left chest tube.

Brief Hospital Course:
She was admitted on ___ and underwent routine 
preoperative testing and evaluation. She remained 
hemodynamically stable and was taken to the operating room on 
___. She underwent coronary artery bypass grafting x 2. 
Please see operative note for full details. She tolerated the 
procedure well and was transferred to the CVICU in stable 
condition for recovery and invasive monitoring. 
  
She weaned from sedation, awoke neurologically intact and was 
extubated on POD 1. She was weaned from inotropic and 
vasopressor support. Beta blocker was initiated and she was 
diuresed toward her preoperative weight. She developed Afib with 
RVR on POD2 and was treated IV Amiodarone bolus and gtt. She was 
transitioned to oral amiodarone. An echo was done for 
hypotension while in RAF which revealed TR and RV dysfunction 
for which she continued on diuresis. She converted to SR that 
evening and had no further episodes of AFib. She was started on 
colchicine for pericarditis. EKG at time of discharge revealed 
improved ST elevations and colchicine was decreased for GI 
upset. She remained hemodynamically stable and was transferred 
to the telemetry floor for further recovery. She remained in the 
hospital for nausea and vomiting which resolved by time of 
discharge. LFTs are normal and she is moving her bowels without 
issue, colchicine dose has been decreased. She was evaluated by 
the physical therapy service for assistance with strength and 
mobility. By the time of discharge on POD 7 she was ambulating 
freely, the wound was healing, and pain was controlled with oral 
analgesics. She was discharged home in good condition with 
appropriate follow up instructions. Her family will be staying 
with her at home.
