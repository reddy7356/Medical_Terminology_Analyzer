Brief Hospital Course:
1) Psychiatric
The patient was admitted to ___ Inpatient Psychiatry for 
stabilization, psychiatric evaluation, and psychopharmacologic 
intervention. The patient arrived to the unit in a highly 
paranoid state and became intermittently aggressive and erratic 
in his behavior, frequently screaming for help, believing that 
people were trying to shoot at him, and feeling suspicious of 
those around him. He frequently attempted to call ___ while on 
the unit because of fears of self-harm. However, the patient 
initially refused any antipsychotic medications because he did 
not like the way he perceived them to make him feel in the past. 
He received *five* chemical restraints over the course of his 
admission in order to maintain his own safety and the safety of 
others. These chemical restraints involved Haldol 5 mg, Ativan 2 
mg, and Benadryl 50 mg administered by IM, though they had been 
offered PO first. Additionally, the patient was encouraged to 
take Saphris (asenapine) 5 mg bid which he took intermittently 
prior to his court hearing on ___.  He was also transiently 
given PRNs of asenapine 5 mg q6hr prn anxiety, and lorazepam 1 
mg q4hr prn anxiety.  He was noted to be intermittently 
paranoid, sometimes hiding behind chairs or stating that someone 
was after him with a gun.  He was also sometimes bizarre. 
However, he did not require a chemical restraint following ___.
.
Mr. ___ received a shot of long acting paliperidone 234 mg IM 
on ___, 156 mg IM on ___, and 156 mg IM on ___ to which he 
had a good respone. He became more interactive with other 
people, less paranoid and frightened, and was able to 
participate in activities such as playing  chess.  He became 
more tolerant of interviews.  Ultimately, he was able to play 
the piano by both memory and sight reading.
.
The patient reported feeling of restlessness after receiving the 
second shot of paliperidone. He consistently paced the halls.  
For the symptom, a trial of propranolol was initiated with no 
effect - and was therefore discontinued.  Ativan also provided 
transient relief of the pacing and related anxiety.  As anxiety 
and irritability worsened with attempts to discontinue the 
gabapentin, the agent was continued at 300 mg po tid.
.
He also voiced the belief that the anti-psychotics were causing 
a constellation of symptoms including 'dementia' and 
extrapyramidal symptoms.  He would pace the halls with short 
strides, arms straight at his sides, and  head down. Of note, if 
distracted, the stride length began to normalize and arm swing 
would appear. He could run.  There was no evidence of rigidity 
on direct examination.  For this reason, at least the style of 
pacing was thought to represent a physical manifestation of a 
delusion regarding the effects of antipsychotics.  
.
For difficulty sleeping, Mr. ___ used ativan and benadryl on 
an as-needed basis.
.
Ambivalence and negative symptoms persisted despite great 
improvements in positive symptoms.  Accordingly, he received 
active guidance on how to structure his day and a list of 
'assignments.'  Although he did generally complete tasks, he did 
not generate his own ideas.
.
He had his last dose of long acting paliperidone 234 mg IM on 
___

2) Medical: 
The patient had no acute medical issues during his hospital 
stay.  
.
3) Psychosocial:
In the course of the hospitalization, Mr. ___ became 
increasingly social.  Throughout the entire month of ___, there 
was no evidence of threatening or aggressive behavior.  He began 
to attend group activities.  He played the piano with members of 
the care team.  He met with his parents who visited regularly 
and often played chess with his father.
.
4) Legal: ___
5) Updated Risk Assessment: 
The patient has some modifiable risk factors for self-harm or 
harm to others which were optimized and reduced to the greatest 
degree possible while on the inpatient unit. He was provided 
psychopharmacologic intervention for his psychosis along with 
groups and 1:1 therapy which should increase his ability to cope 
going forward. However, the patient has certain non-modifiable 
risk factors such as a history of previous aggression, chronic 
mental illness, social isolation, and unemployment which are not 
able to be adjusted. As a result, though he has a chronically 
elevated level of risk, discharge to follow up as an outpatient 
is the least restrictive setting for his ongoing care.
