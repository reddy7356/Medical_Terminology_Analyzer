Brief Hospital Course:
___ man w/ PMH of 2 strokes (___), Afib (on ASA 325 mg), 
HTN, HLD, and alcohol use disorder who presented with acute 
vision loss of the left eye and found to have left ICA occlusion 
with involvement of the left ophthalmic artery.

Physical exam was notable for sluggish pupillary reaction in 
left eye, ___ visual acuity in left eye (compared to ___ 
in the right), loss of all visual fields of left eye with 
macular sparing, nystagmus in left gaze, and left-sided 
intention tremor.

Etiology of occlusion thought to be a cardioembolic secondary to 
A-fib since he is not on AC. Patient was treated acutely with a 
heparin drip. His outpatient stroke neurologist, Dr. ___, has 
had previously recommended initiating anticoagulation; however, 
the patient was unwilling to cut back on the amount of alcohol 
he consumed, so he was continued on ASA 325 mg daily. We again 
recommended anticoagulation (eg warfarin), but the 
patient/family declined. Ultimately, he was discharged on 
aspirin and clopidogrel with plan to see cardiology for 
consideration of a Watchman procedure.

Patient's home HCTZ was held and his home dose of atenolol was 
cut in half in the setting of ICA occlusion. Patient was 
continued on his home medications of aspirin and atorvastatin.

Transitional issues:
===================
- Continue aspirin 81 mg daily and clopidogrel 75 mg daily until 
follow up with stroke.
- Consider transition to anticoagulation, if patient is 
amenable.
- Continue to encourage alcohol cessation.
- Follow up with cardiology for consideration of watchman 
procedure.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,

You were admitted to the hospital after you had a sudden loss of 
your vision in your left eye. A CT scan and an MRI showed that 
you had a blockage of a large blood vessel in your neck that 
supplies blood to the eye. This is likely what caused your loss 
of vision. This blockage is likely caused by a clot that came 
from your heart since you have atrial fibrillation. 

While in the hospital, you were treated with heparin, which is a 
blood thinner. Blood thinners can help decrease your risk of 
clots. Since you have atrial fibrillation and you were not 
taking a blood thinner, you were at higher risk for developing a 
clot like the one that caused your loss of vision. 

When you are discharged, please follow the following 
recommendations: 
- Please attend all of your scheduled clinic appointments 
- Please take all of your medications as prescribed 
- See a cardiologist to discuss a Watchman procedure to decrease 
the risk of stroke 

MEDICATION CHANGES 
- Start clopidogrel 75 mg daily 
- Decrease aspirin to 81 mg daily 

It was a pleasure taking care of you, 
Your ___ care team

paroxysmal Afib and one previous episode of vertigo who 
presented with new onset gait instability.  Per report,
the patient was in his usual state of health recently with no
specific complaints on the evening of ___ when going to
sleep.  He awoke around 0600hrs on ___ still without any
symptoms and noted that after urinating in the bathroom around
0630hrs, the patient developed some vertiginous sensation,
vertical diplopia (which he did not check to see if it cleared
with closing one eye) and had significant difficulty with
balance.  He reported catching himself from falling on the door
and radiator of the bathroom (with no headstrike), and sat on 
the
side of the tub. After ___ minutes, his vertiginous symptoms and
diplopia resolved, and he was able to make his way back to bed
and tried to sleep it off, telling his wife about these symptoms
at 0730hrs.  At 1130hrs, per his daughter who lives with the
patient's report, the patient's wife noted to her that she
thought the patient was more dysarthric (has a stutter at
baseline) and also she thought there was a slight droop in the
patient's left mouth. 

The daughter who accompanied him to the ___ could not confirm
this finding, but did note that his voice was more dysarthric
than usual; she noted having some difficulty in understanding
him.  However, even with these changes he stayed at home trying
to sleep off the symptoms until ___ at which time he was eating
and noted weakness and numbness in the left face, and reported
that while eating, he could not determine the temperature of the
food it was eating, and that the taste was decreased.  He denied
any difficulty with swallowing or chewing. He noted this facial
sensory change was episodic which by the time that he reached

1. Acute right superior cerebellar peduncle and adjacent 
superior cerebellar infarct.  No hemorrhage or mass effect seen. 
 
2. MRA of the neck shows diffuse atherosclerotic disease of the 
right 
vertebral artery.

FINDINGS:  There is no evidence of an acute intracranial 
hemorrhage, mass, 
mass effect or infarction.  Mildly prominent ventricles and 
sulci are likely 
secondary to age-related involutional changes.  The basilar 
cisterns are 
patent.  The gray-white matter differentiation is otherwise 
preserved. 
  
IMPRESSION:  No acute intracranial abnormalities identified. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ is a ___ right handed man with a history of
alcohol dependence, hypertension, hyperlipidemia and one 
previous
episode of vertigo who presented to the ED over the weekend on
the urging of his family members. On the morning of ___, he
developed vertigo, vertical diplopia and ataxia. He had to
hold on to objects around him to walk steadily. He went back to
bed, but then when he woke up, he was noted to be more 
dysarthric
than baseline and there was a question of a left facial droop.
Later on that evening, he had difficulty with numbness on the
left side of his face, and also noticed that he had difficulty
noticing the temperature of foods in his mouth. 

At home, he takes atenolol, HCTZ, thiamine and B12. He has had
difficulties with EtOH dependence in the past, but more 
recently,
it appears that his habit has come under better control. Please
see the admission note for more details. 

Ultimately, he made it to the ED where he was hypertensive to
143/78, and the neurological examination was notable for
dysarthria with left facial droop. He had end-gaze nystagmus 
with
normal hearing. He had normal strength and sensation, and he had
dysmetria on finger-nose testing on the left arm. His NCHCT
identified some mild volume loss that was diffuse.
 
While he has been on our service, he received an MRI and MRA 
(his
admission creatinine was elevated to 1.5). The MRI identifies a
locus of restricted diffusion centered on the right superior
cerebellar peduncle consistent with a partial SCA infarction. 
The
MRA identified no flow along the course of the left vertebral
artery. The basilar artery appears fenestrated but perhaps this
could be artifactual. Labs here have shown an elevated
cholesterol level, with LDL of 139. His A1c is normal. 

He had an echocardiogram in ___ that did not raise concern
for an atrial shunt, though this was not done with bubble study.
Overall, the story and objective findings are consistent with
intracranial atherosclerosis, resulting in an artery-artery
embolism to the right SCP. His risk factors need to be better
addressed. 
- ___ recommendations discharge to home
- During this admission, we have started ASA 325mg and
atorvastatin 40mg daily, which he should take together with his
HCTZ and atenolol.
- Repeat Cr has nicely come down to 1.2. 
- Close follow up with PCP ___
- ___ up with Dr. ___ in stroke clinic

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,

It was a pleasure taking care of you while you were at ___ 
___.  You came in with symptoms of 
vertigo - that the room was spinning around you, as well as 
double vision, left facial numbness and decreased temperature 
sensation, and imbalance.  You have many risk factors for having 
a stroke, including high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and 
possible atrial fibrillation.  Because of your symptoms and your 
multiple risk factors, we were concerned that you were having a 
stroke - an episode in which you do not get enough oxygen to a 
specific area in your brain.  Because of our concerns, you were 
admitted to the hospital.  While you were here we did several 
tests.  We used a CT and MRI scanner to look at your brain, 
which showed us that you had a stroke in the right cerebellar 
peduncle - an area in the brain that would account for the 
symptoms you were having.  

We also did a workup to determine your risk factors for stroke.  
We found that you have high cholesterol (LDL of 151), but do not 
have diabetes. You did not have evidence of Afib on this 
admission. As you had recently had a echocardiogram in ___, 
we did not reimage your heart on this admission.

Because of your stroke, we will recommend you take an aspirin 
daily.  You are also prescribing you atorvastatin -  a 
medication for high cholesterol.  We want you to have close 
follow up with your primary care provider, who will help you 
maintain good control of your blood pressure.

HPI: 
Mr. ___ is a ___ R handed gentleman mainly
___ speaking with a past medical history of a right
superior cerebellar peduncle stroke in ___ currently on 
aspirin,
hypertension, hyperlipidemia gout, and chronic daily alcohol 
use.
He presents today at the request of his family for concerns of
___ weakness and dysarthria that was noted this morning.

Briefly, the patient was last seen normal around 11 ___ when his
family members went to sleep.  The patient continued to stay
awake until about 2 or 3 AM watching TV before he went to sleep. 

This morning, the patient's daughter entered his room to wake 
him
up at 8 AM for him to drive her to work.  This was strange as
typically the patient wakes up a little bit before 8 AM on his
own.  When she woke him up, she noted that his speech was 
slurred
but she thought it was because he was tired.  She left the room
to let him get dressed.  After the period that was longer than
usual, his daughter came back to the room and noted that he was
having difficulty buckling his belt and was having difficulty
using his right hand.  

When she came into the room she saw that his right face seemed
more droopy than usual.  When he spoke his speech was very
unintelligible and it sounded like he was drunk.  He then
proceeded to go to the bathroom without difficulty. She also
maybe noted that his L eyelid was slightly drooping but she was
unsure.  Next, they walked to the kitchen which was on the same
floor.  The patient was able to take his medications and swallow
the pills without difficulty, however when he was trying to 
close
the pill bottles he was having difficulty coordinating with his
right hand.  At this point, his daughter felt very worried that
he may have had a stroke or some other process and urged him to
let her take him to the hospital, however the patient adamantly
refused and said that he wanted to go back to sleep.  The 
patient
then went back to sleep and intermittently woke up every hour
when his daughter called to check on him.  Between 8 and 12, the
patient woke up twice and his speech was still slurred.  At 12
___, the patient woke up and it was thought that his speech was
slightly clear.  However at 1 ___, the patient was back to having
very slurred speech and his facial droop was still present as
noted by another daughter who came to check on him.  At 230pm,
when the patient woke up again he was noted to have difficulty
walking with dragging his right leg and was still dysarthric.  
At
this point, his family stated that they put him in the car and
drove him to ___ for further evaluation.

On discussion with the patient, he stated that he felt that he
was slightly off this morning and that his speech was slurred 
but
otherwise he felt well.  He denied any headaches, any neck pain
and no other systemic symptoms such as fever, chills,, or
fatigue.  The patient states that he takes his medications every
day with full compliance and his daughters also endorses this
history. 

Patient's daughters disclose that the patient has had issues 
with
drinking alcohol over many years.  After he had a stroke in ___
the patient cut alcohol out cold ___ for about a year, 
however
he relapsed and started to drink again.  These days, the patient
is drinking about 6 shots of whiskey between the hours of 5 ___
and 11:30 ___.  He has never had any withdrawal seizures,
typically does not get very drunk or have significant difficulty
functioning.

vision, diplopia,  dysphagia, lightheadedness, vertigo, tinnitus
or hearing difficulty. Denies difficulties producing or
comprehending speech.  Denies focal numbness, parasthesiae. No

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ is a ___ R handed gentleman from 
___ who presented with R facial droop, R sided mild 
weakness in arm and leg and dysarthria noted about 8 AM on 
___ after last known well time was 11pm the night before. 
Initial exam was notable for very subtle signs of weakness with 
slower activation to smile on the R, orbiting around the R arm, 
and dragging his R leg when walking. He also has some slight 
dysmetria on the R which may be new or part of his prior stroke 
in the R cerebellar peduncle. His exam improved with full 
strength throughout with no facial asymmetry and active 
intentional tremors and slight dysmetria R>L on FNF tests. On 
MRI, patient had early subacute infarction involving the left 
caudate head, left putamen, and surrounding structures with a 
small amount of hemorrhagic component. A CTA head and neck 
showed the distal right vertebral artery with no intracranial 
flow demonstrated but was otherwise unremarkable. He was started 
on aspirin 81mg. Telemetry revealed afib, which was diagnosed 
previously, but patient was ___ with warfarin. 
Apixaban was recommended, but patient's ___ was too high and 
therefore, warfarin was once again recommended for stroke 
prophylaxis. Etiology of the stroke thought to be cardioembolic 
from afib not on anticoagulation. Other risk factors checked:

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,

___ were hospitalized due to symptoms of right sided weakness 
and difficulty speaking resulting from an ACUTE ISCHEMIC STROKE 
a condition where a blood vessel providing oxygen and nutrients 
to the brain is blocked by a clot. The brain is the part of your 
body that controls and directs all the other parts of your body, 
so damage to the brain from being deprived of its blood supply 
can result in a variety of symptoms. There was also a small 
amount of bleeding associated with the stroke. 

Stroke can have many different causes, so we assessed ___ for 
medical conditions that might raise your risk of having stroke. 
In order to prevent future strokes, we plan to modify those risk 
factors. Your risk factors are:  

- high blood pressure
- Chronic alcohol intake
- abnormal heart rhythm (afib)

We are changing your medications as follows:  
-continue on aspirin 81mg until ___ with your PCP
-___ will be started on warfarin, a blood thinning medication 
after discussion with your PCP

___ will need your blood levels checked to make sure your blood 
is thin enough to prevent stroke. 

It is very important for ___ to stop drinking alcohol.  

Please take your other medications as prescribed.  

Please follow up with Neurology and your primary care physician 
as listed below.  

If ___ experience any of the symptoms below, please seek 
emergency medical attention by calling Emergency Medical 
Services (dialing 911). In particular, since stroke can recur, 
please pay attention to the sudden onset and persistence of 
these symptoms:  
 - Sudden partial or complete loss of vision  
 - Sudden loss of the ability to speak words from your mouth  
 - Sudden loss of the ability to understand others speaking to 
___  
 - Sudden weakness of one side of the body  
 - Sudden drooping of one side of the face  
 - Sudden loss of sensation of one side of the body  

Sincerely,  

Your ___ Neurology Team
