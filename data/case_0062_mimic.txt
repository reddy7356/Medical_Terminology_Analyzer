Imaging:
CT C-Spine ___:
IMPRESSION: No evidence of acute fracture or malalignment. 
Moderate disc
bulge at ___ cause moderate left foraminal narrowing. If 
there is
concern for specific injury at this level, MRI may remain more 
sensitive for
further evaluation.

Head CT ___:
FINDINGS: A left mixed attenuation subdural hematoma measuring 
up to 3.3 cm
from the outer table likely represents subacute on chronic 
hematoma with
layering noted. There is associated 4 mm rightward shift of 
normally midline structures. The bony calvarium is intact. The 
paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells demonstrate mild left 
maxillary sinus thickening and are otherwise clear. There is no 
evidence of herniation.
IMPRESSION: Left subdural hematoma is likely subacute on chronic 
and causes
4-mm shift of normally midline structures. The hematoma measures 
about 3 cm
in width. There is obliteration of left cerebral sulci. There is 
no evidence of acute fracture or herniation.

LENIS ___:
RIGHT LOWER EXTREMITY ULTRASOUND: The right common femoral, 
superficial
femoral and popliteal veins demonstrate normal waveforms, flow 
and
augmentation. There is no evidence of intraluminal thrombus.
IMPRESSION: No right lower extremity DVT.

MRI L-Spine ___:
FINDINGS: Alignment of the lumbar spine appears normal. 
Vertebral body
signal intensity appears normal. There are extensive 
degenerative changes of the L5-S1 intervertebral disc with loss 
of height and loss of signal on the long TR images as well as 
posterior osteophyte formation. The distal thoracic cord and 
conus appear normal. The conus medullaris ends at approximately 
L1. No intradural abnormalities are detected. Axial images at 
L3-4 and L4-5 reveal no significant abnormalities. The 
intervertebral osteophytes noted above at L5-S1 indents the 
thecal sac but do not appear to cause nerve root compression.
CONCLUSION: No evidence of nerve root compression. Degenerative 
changes at
L5-S1 with loss of disc height and osteophyte formation 
minimally indenting
the spinal canal.

Head CT ___:
IMPRESSIONS:
1. Stable appearance of complex left subdural collection, likely 
reflecting
subacute on chronic subdural hematoma. Unchanged mild rightward 
subfalcine
herniation.
2. No new abnormalities.
 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ gentleman who was admitted to ___ 
___ after a
fall. A CT scan revealed extensive left-sided subdural hematoma 
with multiple membranes. Multiple chronicities were encountered. 
Since the patient was
clinically symptomatic he needed to go to the operating room for 
decompression on ___. He was admitted to the ICU postoperatively 
for monitoring overnight.  On POD#1, he was then transferred to 
the neurosurgery floor.  Physical and occupational therapy were 
consulted, and they determined that he would be appropriate for 
discharge to home with services. The hope is that he will be 
transitioned to outpatient services in the near future. He was 
discharged on ___.
