presents from ___ facility with "rocking on a boat"  sensation
and difficulty walking.

For the past month she has been using fentanyl daily.  Her last
use was 5 days prior to presentation.  She has been undergoing
significant withdrawal in the last 5 days, including but not
limited to fevers, chills, sweats, nausea, decreased appetite,
diarrhea, as well as an episode of emesis.  She went to detox 
one

this morning who recommended she go to the hospital for medical
clearance.  She went to the outside hospital was subsequently

She has been unable to walk for the past 8 days.  She feels like
this was a sudden onset, and has been worsening each day.  She
feels that she is falling to the left and has had several falls

boat.  She initially has difficulty determining whether this is
constant, but she feels that it has been constant over the last 
2
days.  She describes that her falls and gait has subsequently
been worse the last 2 days.

Of note, 3 weeks ago she had a pneumonia and she woke up with
left hand weakness at wrist and fingers.  She today she was seen
by her outside hospital neurologist who felt it was a radial
nerve palsy.  Her hand has slowly started to improve and she is
able to wink wiggle her fingers, but she is unable to lift her
wrist at this time.

___ Brain w/o contrast
1. Study is mildly degraded by motion. 
2. No evidence of intracranial hemorrhage or acute infarction. 
3. Scattered foci of white matter abnormality.  Differential 
considerations include sequela of prior trauma or infection, 
history of migraine headaches, inflammatory or demyelinating 
process, and microangiopathic changes.  If concern for active 
demyelinating process, consider contrast enhanced brain MRI for 
further evaluation. 

___ H&N
The carotid and vertebral arteries and their major branches are 
patent. 
  
There is paraseptal emphysema and mild bronchial wall thickening 
at the lung apices. 

MR ___ with contrast: 
1. Unremarkable cervical spine MRI. 
 
 
Brief Hospital Course:
MS. ___ is a ___ woman who presented to ___ with 
gait instability and recent "rocking on a boat" sensation for 
the past few days , she presented from her ___ facility where 
she was undergoing treatment for recent heavy Fentanyl Use. The 
patient has a history of HIV, hepatitis C, and non compliance 
with medications. She also has used IV drugs, cocaine, and 
alcohol in the past. Due to concern for stroke, she underwent 
CTA Head and Neck and MRI Brain w/o contrast which showed no 
evidence of cerebrovascular insult. Her C-spine was also imaged 
given her gait instability however this was unremarkable on 
testing.  Upon admission to Neurology service, she was continued 
on her previous Suboxone taper as well as symptomatic treatment 
for Fentanyl withdrawal. She was maintained on CIWA Protocol w/ 
Valium. She was also started on high dose Thiamine, folic acid, 
and multivitamin for nutritional deficiency. 

The patient improved dramatically during her hospitalization and 
given her negative work up, likely she had ataxia from acute 
toxic metabolic causes given her recent heavy drug use along 
with detoxification and the start of multiple medications to aid 
in her detoxification. As her detoxification was complete, the 
patient improved. She worked with ___ and was discharged home 
with a cane and a prescription for a few sessions of outpatient 
___. Second, prior to the patient came to the hospital she had 
developed a radial nerve palsy, and had seen an outpatient 
neurologist. She was given a wrist splint. Here, she was seen by 
OT and given a more supportive, better fitted brace. She will 
follow up with us here in Neurology during ___. Patient 
offered prescription for suboxone (2mg for 2 doses) on discharge 
to fill at pharmacy, however patient stated that she did not 
feel that she needed the medication. 

The patient was safely discharged home. 

Transitions of Care Issues: 
1. Patient to follow up with Neurology at ___ on 
scheduled appointment date
2. Patient to take all home medications as prescribed
3. Patient to go to ___ outpatient for a few sessions
4. Patient to use straight cane to ambulate
5. Patient to use left wrist brace splint prescribed by OT

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___, 

You were admitted to the General Neurology Service at ___ in 
___ after you had difficulty walking and felt a sensation 
that you were on a boat. You had a variety of head and neck 
imaging that did not reveal any strokes or spinal cord disease 
which is good news. Likely, you had a toxic metabolic reason for 
ataxia (gait instability) that improved with time. We started 
you on multi vitamins, thiamine, and folate which helped with 
your nutritional status. 
Second, you also had a radial nerve compression which causes 
wrist and finger weakness. Likely with time and rest, this will 
improve. Please continue to wear your wrist brace for 
improvement. You will have a script for physical therapy once 
you return home and will also have a cane to help with balance. 
Please follow up with the Neurologist Dr. ___/ Dr. ___ on 
___ at 4:30 ___. 
Please take your other medications at home as prescribed and do 
not miss any doses. 

It was a pleasure to care for you. 

Sincerely, 

Your ___ Neurology Team 
 
Followup Instructions:
