MICRO:
___ 9:53 am SPUTUM     Site: ENDOTRACHEAL
      Source: Endotracheal. 

   GRAM STAIN (Final ___: 
      >25 PMNs and <10 epithelial cells/100X field. 
      NO MICROORGANISMS SEEN. 
___: URINE CX
___: BLOOD CX
.
IMAGING:
CXR ___:
FINDINGS:  Tip of endotracheal tube terminates approximately 5 
cm above the carina.  A poorly defined mass is present in the 
left suprahilar region,likely corresponding to history of left 
upper lobe mass.  Additionally, a poorly defined opacity is 
present in the left retrocardiac region, accompanied by a small 
left pleural effusion.  Correlative CT imaging may be helpful 
for more complete characterization of these findings if not 
already performed. Right lung is hyperexpanded but grossly 
clear.
.
PET CT ___:
1.  FDG-avid left hilar mass narrowing the left upper lobe 
bronchus, consistent with bronchogenic carcinoma. 2.  
FDG-avidity within the medial left upper lobe is likely due to 
post-obstructive inflammation. 3.  Mild FDG uptake in the 
subcarinal region may be reactive, but metastatic disease is not 
excluded. 4.  No evidence of FDG-avid distant metastasis.  
Multiple pulmonary nodules are better evaluated on recent 
CT-Chest. 
.
BRAIN MRI ___: 1.  No evidence of enhancing brain lesions. 
2.  Brain and medial temporal atrophy and small vessel disease. 
3.  No acute infarcts, mass effect or hydrocephalus. 
.
OTHER RESULTS:
LYMPH NODE, 11L, FINE NEEDLE ASPIRATION ___:
NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS.
- Polymorphous lymphocytes, consistent with lymph node sampling.
- Bronchial epithelial cells.
- Blood.
.
SPUTUM CYTOLOGY ___: Rare atypical cells in a background of 
macrophages and neutrophils.

___ ECHO
The left atrial volume is normal. No left atrial mass/thrombus 
seen (best excluded by transesophageal echocardiography). The 
estimated right atrial pressure is at least 15 mmHg. Left 
ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and regional/global 
systolic function are normal (LVEF >55%). Tissue Doppler imaging 
suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure 
(PCWP>18mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall 
motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly 
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Trace aortic 
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve appears structurally 
normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is no mitral 
valve prolapse. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. 
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is 
no pericardial effusion. 

IMPRESSION: Normal biventricular cavity sizes with preserved 
regional and global biventricular systolic function. Moderate 
tricuspid regurgitation. Mild pulmonary artery hypertension. 
Increased PCWP.

CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: 
Based on ___ AHA endocarditis prophylaxis recommendations, the 
echo findings indicate prophylaxis is NOT recommended. Clinical 
decisions regarding the need for prophylaxis should be based on 
clinical and echocardiographic data.  

Chest Xray ___
CHEST RADIOGRAPH 
  
INDICATION:  Status post left upper lobectomy, chest tube 
removal, evaluation. 
  
COMPARISON:  ___. 
  
FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the air-fluid 
level 
previously seen is resolved.  Apart of an approximately 8-mm 
left apical 
pneumothorax, the remaining left lung is well expanded.  There 
is a minimal 
effusion blunting the left costophrenic sinus. 
  
Normal appearance of the right lung.  Borderline size of the 
cardiac 
silhouette without pulmonary edema. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ smoker with pmh of HTN who presents from OSH with 
hemoptysis, recently found to have 2cm spiculated mass at L 
hilar region encasing LUL bronchus, abutting L PA with course 
c/b hemoptysis requiring MICU transfer and intubation.
.
# Pulmonary hemorrhage: Pt immediately transferred from floor to 
ICU after desaturating to 91% on non-rebreather in setting of 
continued small volume hemoptysis. Pt intubated for airway 
protection and a bloody mucous plug was visualized in the left 
mainstem bronchus. She was taken to OR by IP for rigid 
bronchoscopy on ___ where she underwent left main stem 
cautery and cryotherapy.  She went to ___ ___ for bronchial 
artery embolization. A small common trunk supplying right and 
left hilum was identified but could not be cannulated with a 
catheter and guidewire. After several attempts, the vessel could 
no longer be identified, possibly due to spasm or dissection, 
and the procedure was aborted. She was extubated without 
difficulty on ___ and transferred to the floor on ___. 
 On the floor, her Hct remained stable and she had no episodes 
of hemoptysis. She received codeine for cough suppression.
.
# Left Hilar Mass, RLL nodule: Likely malignant given smoking 
history. Pt had EBUS and TBNA of lymph node (did not biopsy mass 
due to concern for bleeding). TBNA of lymph node was negative 
for malignant cells. Sputum cytology showed atypical cells, but 
was nondiagnostic.  She was evaluated by both radiation oncology 
and thoracic surgery. PET scan and brain MRI showed no evidence 
of extra-pulmonary metastases. PFTs were performed ___ and 
she was determined to be a surgical candidate.  The pt and her 
family chose to pursue surgical intervention over radiation 
therapy.
. 
#HTN: Held home nifedipine in setting of acute bleed and BPs 
___.

On ___ Thoracic Surgery was consulted for surgical 
intervention and the patient was transferred to thoracic surgery 
service. After in detail discussion with the patient and her 
family she opt in for surgical intervention. Informed consent 
was obtained after discussing risks and benefits of the 
procedure. The patient was pre-op'ed and taken to the operating 
room on ___. She underwent 
1. Flexible bronchoscopy.
2. Cervical mediastinoscopy.
3. Left upper lobectomy.
4. Arterioplasty of left main pulmonary artery.
5. Mediastinal lymph node dissection.
6. Buttressing of bronchial staple line with thymus.
The procedure went well without complication. She was extubated 
and transferred to the PACU. She did well in PACU and 
transferred to surgical floor. Her pain was controlled with 
epidural. On ___ her chest tube put out 350cc of fluids. He 
SBP was in 80-90s, pt was asymptomatic, her home dose Nifadipine 
was held for low blood pressure. her diet was advanced to 
regular on ___, which she tolerated well. She was 
triggered for new onset atrial fibrillation. Metoprolol 5 IV was 
given, which she responded well. She also received 500cc of NS 
bolus for low urine output with good response. On ___ she 
received Metoprolol 5 IV for another episode of afib with hear 
rate of 150s, she responded well. She desaturated requiring 6L 
NC, she was then transferred to the TSICU for bedside 
bronchoscopy. It was performed by interventional pulmonologist, 
big mucus plug was removed. Her breathing status improved after 
the procedure but she still remained on ___ L of oxygen through 
nasal cannula. She remained in the ICU, received albuterol 
nebulizers every 4 hours with good response. Cardiology was also 
consulted for new onset afib. They recommended anticoagulation 
and rate control. Metoprolol 12.5 BID and Xarelto 20 daily was 
started. On ___, pt was doing well, she was only on 2L NC 
Sats >92. Her foley was removed, she later voided without any 
issues, her chest tube was also removed. The patient was 
transferred to floor on the same day. On ___ her 
Metoprolol dose was increased to TID for better rate control. On 
___ she was again triggered for afib, received digoxin 
load, which she responded well. Digoxin 125 daily was added to 
her daily standing medications for better rate control.

Physical therapy also evaluated the patient and recommended to 
be discharged to rehabilitation clinic for further physical 
therapy.
 
On ___ pt was doing well, her vital signs were stable, 
heart rate in good control, her pain well managed. After an 
uneventful night she was discharged to rehab with follow up 
instructions.
