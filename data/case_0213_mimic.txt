___ woman post NSTEMI (infero-lateral ST dep and TWI TnT 
6.41 presenting as CHF post L THR on ___ and at angiography 
there was evidence of two vessel coronary artery disease 
including a 90% proximal stenosis and a 30% mid-vessel stenosis

___ ___: The left atrium is moderately dilated. Left 
ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular 
cavity is mildly dilated. Overall left ventricular systolic 
function is severely depressed (LVEF= 15 %) secondary to 
akinesis of the entire interventricular septum, anterior free 
wall, inferior free wall, and apex. The only segments of the 
left ventricle that are not akinetic or severely hypokinetic are 
the basal segments of the posterior and lateral walls. Tissue 
Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling 
pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). There is no ventricular septal defect. 
Right ventricular chamber size is normal. with focal hypokinesis 
of the apical free wall. There are focal calcifications in the 
aortic arch. The aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened. 
Significant aortic stenosis is present (not quantified). The 
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral 
valve prolapse. Moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is 
seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral 
regurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated.] The 
tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is mild 
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial 
effusion. Compared with the findings of the prior study (images 
reviewed) of ___, left ventricular contractile 
function is markedly further decreased; mitral regurgitation is 
significantly increased.  

___ ___: LVEF 20%, moderate 2+ MR.
___ ___: RV systolic function appear slightly worse, LEVF 
25%, 3+ MR.
___ ___: RV function appears slightly improved and estimated 
pulmonary artery pressure is lower. LVEF ___, 3+ MR.  

___ ___: Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The 
left ventricular cavity size is top normal/borderline dilated. 
There is severe global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 
___ %). No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. 
The right ventricular cavity is moderately dilated with severe 
global free wall hypokinesis. The aortic valve leaflets are 
moderately thickened. Significant aortic stenosis is present 
(not quantified). The mitral valve leaflets are mildly 
thickened. Moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen. 
Tricuspid regurgitation is present but cannot be quantified. The 
pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined. 
There is no pericardial effusion. Compared with the prior study 
(images reviewed) of ___, LV systolic dysfunction remains 
severely depressed. RV systolic function is now significantly 
depressed.  

ECG on admission ___: Sinus rhythm. Left bundle-branch 
block. Compared to the previous tracing of ___ no definite 
change. 

ECG ___: Sinus rhythm. Left bundle-branch block. 
Intermittent wide complex beats of different morphology that may 
be late-cycle ventricular premature beats versus possible 
changing pattern of intraventricular conduction delay showing 
left axis deviation. Since the previous tracing of ___ there 
is no significant change. 

CXR on admission ___: Allowing for differences in patient 
positioning, large left and moderate right pleural effusions are 
not substantially changed. Together with basilar atelectasis, 
there is obscuration of the heart borders. Mild-to-moderate 
pulmonary edema is not changed. There is no pneumothorax. Aortic 
calcifications are noted. 

CXR ___: Progression of venous congestion with moderately 
large bilateral pleural effusions. 
 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ s/p NSTEMI ___ with stent to LAD who presented with 
worsening CHF, echo demonstrated significant worsening in LV 
function (LVEF 15%, most recent ___ and MR, s/p 
cardiac catheterization ___ which revealed in-stent 
restenosis of proximal LAD and worsened atherosclerotic disease 
of left main stem. Impella with stenting of LMA lesions on 
___. Her post-catherization recovery had been complicated by 
___, hypotension, and respiratory distress due to pulmonary 
edema. She developed left limb ischemia likely secondary to 
contrast nephropathy in addition to hypotension and her 
condition progressivly deteriorated and she died on ___ 
after being made for comfort measures only on ___.
. 
# Systolic heart failure: Worsening SOB, increased pulmonary 
edema and bilateral pleurel effusions thought to be secondary to 
either worsening MR or ischemic cardiomyopathy on admission. 
Echo on day of admission revealed diminished LVEF for 15% and 
moderate 3+ MR.  ___ cath on ___ revealed 90% instent 
restenosis of the LAD stent as well as left main disease, and 
the patient underwent impella-supported PCI on ___ with 
stenting of left main. She was electively intubated for the 
procedure following an episode of hypoxia the night of ___ 
in which she temporarily required a non-rebreather and CPAP to 
maintain O2 sats. She was able to be extubated shortly after 
returning to the CCU.  Repeat echo ___ showed improved LVEF 
of 20% and reduced MR, 2+. The patient had a PICC line placed 
and was briefly started on dopamine, however she did not 
torelate this and it was discontinued.  She later developed 
acute renal failure post-procedure with anuria likely due to a 
combination of low BP and contrast induced nephropathy requiring 
CVVH for which she was dependent. Her SBP was consistently low 
with SBP in ___ and was closely monitord. She started to recieve 
blood pressure support with Norepinephrine which she initially 
tolerated well and at highr levels was associated with 
increasingly ischemic appearance of her left ___ and she was 
eventually weaned off only to be restarted on the morning of 
___. Patient remained on oxygen via nasal cannula ___, and 
maintained her O2 sats on this. She started heparin gtt (___) 
for both for her cardiac hypokinesis and any potential arterial 
embolism of her left leg after her INR decreased to 
subtherapeutic levels. By ___, her SBP ropped into tteh ___ and 
norepinephrine wa restarted although her ischemic limbs became 
worse and her BP was only able to be maintained in the high 
___. On ___ after discussion with her family, she was 
made for comfort measures only and an echo on ___ revealed a 
significantly decreased LVEF of only ___, in addition to 
worse RV systolic function. She died on ___.           
.
# CAD: The patient had an NSTEMI in ___ s/p L THR surgery, 
and it was thought that an ischemic cardiomyopathy may be the 
etiology for her current presentation.  There was a question of 
whether her LAD stent had thrombosed, given significant 
worsening of LV function (EF ___ in ___ to EF of 15% on 
admission ___.  The patient underwent a cardiac cath on 
___ to evaluate her coronary arteries, which revealed 90% 
in-stent restenosis in the proximal LAD, worsened 
atheresclerotic disease of the left main (ostial 70% left main 
lesion), and complete occlusion of the RCA with the distal RCA 
perfused via collaterals.  The patient did not wish for surgical 
intervention, and then underwent an impella-supported PCI with 
stenting of the left main stem on ___.  She was electively 
intubated for the procedure after a brief episode of hypoxia the 
night prior to the cath. After the interventional catherization 
her asprin, plavix was continued. She recieved simvastatin which 
was discontinued ___ given increasing LFTs. Metoprolol held 
given her hypotension. She was placed on heaprin drip after her 
INR became subtherapeutic on ___.  
.
# Acute Renal Failure: The patient's Cr trended up from 1.2 on 
admission to 3.0 on ___.  A renal consult was called. Likely 
secondary to contrast nephropathy, as well as renal compromise 
in setting of hypotension.  Patient remained anuric x6 days. 
Started CVVH ___, with goal of removing 50-100mL of fluid per 
hour through a femoral dialysis line. Electrolytes were closely 
monitored and repleted as needed. Hemodynamics and respiratory 
status were closely monitored. Resipratory status greatly 
improved with removal of fluid by dialysis but she remained 
anuric and was initially due to have a permanent dialysis 
catheter placed but was too unstable to go for the procedure so 
CVVH was continued with her femoral dialysis line. She developed 
progressive cardiovascular instability and she required furtehr 
inotropic support. She was made for comfort measures only on 
___ and died on ___.     
.  
# Hypotension - BP was hypotensive on admission, likely 
multifactorial and secondary to diuresis, anti-hypertensives and 
poor CO.  SBP range generally ___ with several SBP readings 
as low as ___ following administration of IV metoprolol which 
was held on most of the admission.  Her BP was also felt to be 
contributory to her acute renal failuer which occurred post-cath 
and was felt to be in combination with contrast-induced 
nephropathy following two catheterisations and a high contrast 
burden. Norepinephrine was used intermittengly for blood 
pressure support and she was able initially to be weaned off 
this post-catheterisation however due to persistent severe 
hypotension on ___ this was restarted. She was made for comfort 
measures only on ___ and died ___.
.
# Hyperlipidemia - She was continued on her home simvastatin 
until ___, when it was stopped in setting of rising LFTs and 
elevated CK.
.
# Ischemic lower limbs in context of hypotension: On admission 
there were faintly palpable peripheral pulses in both feet left 
worse than right. Her left foot to the mid-shin was noted to be 
mottled since vasopressors were requierd to support her BP. She 
was reviewed daily by vascular who felt no acute intervention 
was needed but recommended a heparin infusion which was 
commenced on ___. Leg appearance initially improved with 
weaning norepinephine and using bear-hugger to warm extremities 
however worsened with decreasing SBPs.  Pulses in the feet were 
intermittently present on doppler in the right foot and absent 
on the left but this also varied as to being detectable. She 
also had considerable ischemic limb pain requiring increasing 
levels of IV hydromorphoen with associated sedation. We 
continued the warming blanket which seemed to help her leg 
appearance and potentially pain. CK levels were trended in case 
of compartment syndrome following re-perfusion injury but 
generally decreased. By ___, both legs appeared ischemic, worse 
on the left with on pulses present on doppler and greatly 
decreased capillary refill worsening with falling BP. She was 
made for comfort measures only on ___ and died on ___. 
.
#Increasing LFT’s –Possibly caused by hypoperfusion because of 
the diminished cardiac output from her ischemic disease. Also 
could have been drug related. The AST/ALT levels were 182/174 
respectively, and not remarkable enough for ischemic liver. No 
signs of abdominal tenderness were seen on physical exam. We 
discontinued her statin and restarted tylenol only after 
increasing lower extremity pain. We trended her LFT's.
.
# Run of VT. On admission, patient was in sinus rhythm with LBBB 
(partial) and infero-lateral ischemic changes on ECG. The 
patient had episodes of PVC’s ___ beats intermittently at 
increasing frequency, and had several runs of NSVT. There was an 
episode of ?VT on ___ VT which EP felt rhythm more likely to be 
VT than SVT with aberrancy.  Patient started on amiodarone 
infusion on ___.  Arrhythmia could be due to ischemic 
ventricular tissue/reperfusion of injured ventricular tissue, or 
electrolyte imbalance. We trended electrolytes and repleted as 
needed. We held Metoprolol given her hypotension. She had no 
furtehr episodes of VT until her death on ___.
.
#Thrush –observed on physical exam on ___. Possibly caused by 
prolonged usage of facial oxygen mask and NC which can dry the 
mucous membranes. Admistered Nystatin swish and swallow which 
was administered by a tongue sponge. 
.
# Leukocytosis- WBC trended down, after initially being elevated 
and patient was afebrile with no clinical signs of infection.  
However, given decline in hemodynamic stability, we monitored 
closely for signs of infection/sepsis. We followed up blood 
cultures and continue to trend WBC which was trending down. She 
did not require any antibiotics.

# Confirmation of death - Dr ___ ___
Called to see patient at 0216. Patient's code status changed to 
comfort measures only earlier today, and she has been on 
morphine gtt titrated to patient's comfort. Patient seen and 
examined. Pupils fixed and dilated. No heart sounds or breath

History of Present Illness:
This is an ___ yo woman with history of type II diabetes, 
peripheral vascular disease, hypertension, and hyperlipid who 
was recently admitted to CCU for respiratory distress in the 
setting of decompensated heart failure and NSTEMI. She presented 
to the ED last night from rehab less than 24 hours 
post-discharge for increasing shortness of breath.  

She says that she arrived at rehab yesterday afternoon feeling 
generally well. She ate dinner after which she developed mild 
abdominal discomfort that resolved spontaneously. She then felt 
as if her heart was beating fast, and she also felt tired. There 
was no chest pain or pressure, lightheadedness or dizziness. She 
says she was diaphoretic at the time. Her daughter, concerned, 
called ___. En route to the hospital, she was noted to be 
tachypnic and hypoxic (per ED report).  

Initially in the ED she was hypoxic to mid ___. She was also 
hypertensive to 180s initially. EKG showed sinus tachycardia 
with LAD (unchanged). Widened QRS (114 ms) with ST elevations in 
anterior precordial leads (unchanged) and ST-depressions/T-wave 
inversions in lateral leads (unchanged). CXR showed bilateral 
perihilar consolidations worse from two days prior with 
persistent pleural effusions; overall impression was worsening 
pulmonary edema, although infection could not be excluded. ABG 
showed 7.43/36/124. Lactate was 2.4. Labs were notable for white 
count of 16.1 with 66.2% neutrophils and no bands. BMP showed a 
bicarb of 21 with anion gap of 12. Renal function was normal. Of 
note, her troponin was 2.63 (down from previous 6.41 on ___ 
with flat CK. BNP was 14,871 (no prior for comparison). She was 
placed on a nitro drip intially; this was quickly weaned off. 
She was also placed on BiPAP intially. There were attempts made 
to wean her to face mask or nasal cannula. However, per ED 
report she became tachypnic to ___ with these measures, and 
therefore she was readmitted to the CCU.  

At time of admission, her sats were 95-96% on NRB, RR ___, 
heart rate in the ___ with systolic BP 110s. In the ED she 
received aspirin 325 mg x1, levofloxacin 750 mg x1, and Lasix 40 
mg IV x1.  
  
Of note, during her previous admission ___ to ___, she was 
intubated for respiratory distress secondary to mitral 
regurgitation which was believed secondary to ischemia. This all 
had happened after an elective left total hip replacement at ___ 
___. She underwent echocardiogram that showed a new 
___ wall motion abnormality and underwent cardiac cath 
that revealed LAD disease for which a bare metal stent was 
placed. She was started on Plavix and high-dose aspirin, as well 
as Lovenox with bridge to coumadin for apical akinesis (LVEF 
___ noted on echocardiogram. She worked with physical 
therapy for two days without chest pain or dyspnea and was felt 
to be ready for discharge to rehab.

Transthoracic Echocardiogram ___:
Conclusions  
The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall 
thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There is moderate 
regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with severe 
hypokinesis of the distal halves of the anterior septum, 
anterior and inferior walls as well as apex. The remaining 
segments contract normally (LVEF = ___ %). [Intrinsic left 
ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the 
severity of valvular regurgitation.] No masses or thrombi are 
seen in the left ventricle. Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an 
increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Right 
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The 
aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened (?#). No aortic 
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly 
thickened. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is 
mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no 
pericardial effusion. 

IMPRESSION: Normal left ventricular cavity size with extensive 
regional systolic dysfunction c/w multivessel CAD (mid-LAD and 
PDA distributions). Increased PCWP. Moderate mitral 
regurgitation. Pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.

CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: 
The left ventricular ejection fraction is <40%, a threshold for 
which the patient may benefit from a beta blocker and an ACE 
inhibotor or ___. 
Based on ___ AHA endocarditis prophylaxis recommendations, the 
echo findings indicate prophylaxis is NOT recommended. Clinical 
decisions regarding the need for prophylaxis should be based on 
clinical and echocardiographic data.  

CXR ___
1. Pulmonary edema with effusions, progressive in comparison to 
two days
prior.
2. Calcification of the ascending aorta that appears new from 
recent prior
studies. Repeat chest radiograph is recommended to evaluate for 
change in
contour of the ascending aorta.

___: left hip plain films
Recent hip replacement. Clips are seen in the soft tissues. 
Massive vascular calcifications. Normal position of the joint 
replacement. No evidence of fracture or dislocation

___ Left hip ultrasound
Direct ultrasound examination was performed around the surgical 
site in the anterior and posterior aspect of the left upper 
thigh. Allowing for mild obscuration from the surgical dressing, 
there is no large hematoma. There is expected mild 
post-operative soft tissue edema. IMPRESSION: No large hematoma 
seen around the left hip surgical site.

___: CT abdomen and pelvis:
ABDOMEN: The liver, spleen, adrenal glands, and pancreas are 
normal. The gallbladder is distended, maximum diameter of which 
measures 4.7 cm. There is no pericholecystic fluid collection 
and the gallbladder wall thickness is normal. No intra- or 
extra-hepatic biliary duct dilatation seen. Simple cyst seen in 
the mid pole of left kidney measuring 2.1 x 2 cm. The right 
kidney is normal. No hydronephrosis. Extensive atherosclerotic 
calcifications are seen in the abdominal aorta and the iliac 
arteries. No free fluid. The IVC and aorta are of normal 
caliber. No evidence of retroperitoneal hematoma. 
PELVIS: Significant artifact seen in the lower pelvis from beam 
hardening due to bilateral hip prosthesis. No free fluid seen in 
the pelvis. Calcified fibroid seen in the uterus. Air noted 
within the urinary bladder, likely secondary to Foley 
catheterization. Scattered colonic diverticulosis without 
evidence of diverticulitis. The visualized large bowel is 
otherwise unremarkable. 

There is a large hyperdense collection seen in the region of the 
left gluteal muscle extending inferiorly along the posterior 
aspect of the thigh. This measures approximately 9.5 x 6.2 x 4 
cm. Given patient's recent left hip replacement, this likely 
represents a hematoma and it measures 67 Hounsfield units. The 
lowermost extent of the hematoma is not evaluated on this 
examination. Bilateral total hip replacements noted. 
  
Degenerative changes are seen in the thoracic or lumbar spine. 
At L1-2 and 
T12-L1, there is reduced disc space with vacuum phenomenon. 
  
IMPRESSION: 
1. Hyperdense collection in the left gluteal region extending 
inferiorly 
along the posterior aspect of the femoral shaft, representing 
hematoma. 
Findings were called to Dr. ___ at 2:44 p.m. on ___.  
2. Bilateral moderate pleural effusions with atelectatic changes 
of lung 
bases.
 
Brief Hospital Course:
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: in summary this is an ___ yo woman with a 
history of type II diabetes, peripheral vascular disease, 
hypertension, and hyperlipidemia recently admitted to the CCU 
for respiratory distress in the setting of decompensated heart 
failure and NSTEMI, now presenting for acute worsening of 
shortness of breath.  
 
# Hypoxia: Her hypoxia was likely secondary to flash pulmonary 
edema in the setting of hypertension. It is not clear what 
precipitated the hypertension, although she was documented to 
have a systolic blood pressure of 180 upon arrival to the 
emergency room. She was treated with supplemental oxygen, 
intravenous lasix for diuresis and the dose of her metoprolol 
was increased for better blood pressure control. Eventually with 
this regimen her oxygen was weaned off and her respiratory 
function improved significantly. She will be discharged on Lasix 
40 mg daily and her renal function and electrolytes should be 
followed at rehab and the lasix dosing adjusted accordingly. She 
has been receiving prn doses of ___ mg IV Lasix once daily to 
help with diuresis, and she has responded very well to this 
regimen. Her most recent creatinine is 0.7 to 0.8, with a BUN 
ranging from 26 to 31.

# Hypertension: As above, metoprolol was adjusted during this 
admission aiming for a target systolic blood pressure less than 
130. She was continued on lisinopril 20 mg daily and the Lasix 
dose was adjusted as above. With these treatments, her blood 
pressure was consistently at target.

# Leukocytosis: On admission she had an elevated white count but 
was afebrile without bandemia or localizing signs of infection. 
She received one dose of levofloxacin in the emergency room but 
this was discontinued and her white count normalized.
  
# Coronary artery disease: She is s/p perioperative MI with BMS 
in LAD. This admission there were no new ischemic changes on 
EKG. Her cardiac enzymes were downward trending from her prior 
admission. She continued to take aspirin, plavix, simvastatin, 
and metoprolol.
 
# Apical akinesis: She was noted to have apical akinesis on her 
last echocardiogram and she was being anticouagulated with 
coumadin for a six month course; however she developed a 
hematoma in her left lateral gluteus following a fall; please 
see CT findings above for full report. Orthopedics service was 
consulted and felt that the hematoma had stopped bleeding; they 
did not believe that surgical intervention was necessary, and 
they felt that her anticoagualation could be resumed. Thus we 
have restarted her coumadin, and due to the bleed we have 
decreased the Lovenox dose to 40 mg daily (prophylactic dose 
given the recent hip replacement), until her coumadin levels are 
therapeutic. Dr. ___ in cardiology clinic can decide on the 
duration of anticoagulation and the plan for follow-up 
echocardiogram. She has been referred to the heart failure 
clinic with a plan to follow up with Dr ___ as her outpatient 
cardiologist. INR should be checked in rehab at the discretion 
of the rehab physician, and she should follow up with the 
___ clinic after discharge from rehab. Her most 
recent INR was 1.0 on ___ (down from 1.2 and 1.4 on ___ and ___, respectively, in the setting of holding her 
coumadin. Coumadin was restarted on ___ at a dose of 3 mg 
daily.
  
# S/p left hip replacement: She had a left hip replacement at ___ 
___ prior to her previous admission. Communication with her 
orthopedic surgeon related that she was full weight-bearing and 
she was evaluated by ___ with a recommendation for rehab. She had 
a fall without head trauma the day prior to her last discharge, 
which she only informed the housestaff about on the day of her 
readmission. At the time of this admission, it was noted that 
she had a drop in hematocrit to 22 from her baseline of 30. She 
was transfused two units of PRBCs. Heparin and Lovenox were 
temporarily held. She had a CT abdomen/pelvis and was found to 
have a bleed in her left lateral gluteus. She was seen by 
orthopedics with a recommendation for conservative management; 
they felt that the bleed would tamponade itself off, and given 
her stable hematocrit and improving clinical exam, this was felt 
to be the case. Her lovenox dose was decreased from 60 mg BID to 
40 mg daily (prophylactic dose). Coumadin was restarted. She 
received tylenol and morphine with a bowel regimen for pain 
control. She will follow up with her orthopedic doctor at 
___ within 2 weeks of her hip replacement.
  
# Anemia: She had a fall in her hematocrit in the setting of her 
left lateral gluteal hematoma. She was transfused 2 units of 
blood and her hematocrit remained stable after that.

# Anxiety / history of depression: The patient previously had 
been treated with Prozac 20 mg daily but refused this medication 
during this and her previous hospitalization.

# Disposition: She is discharged to a rehab facility.

# Code Status: FULL.

2D-ECHOCARDIOGRAM:  ___. The left atrium and right atrium 
are normal in cavity size. Left ventricular wall thickness, 
cavity size, and global systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%). 
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left 
ventricular cavity is mildly dilated. There is mild regional 
left ventricular systolic dysfunction with akinesis of the 
inferior and inferolateral walls. [Intrinsic left ventricular 
systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of 
valvular regurgitation.] Right ventricular chamber size and free 
wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly 
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic 
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly 
thickened. Moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen. 
Due to the eccentric nature of the regurgitant jet, its severity 
may be significantly underestimated (Coanda effect). The 
tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is moderate 
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial 
effusion.

IMPRESSION: Inferior and inferolateral akinesis consistent with 
prior infarction. The posterior leaflet of the mitral valve is 
tethered with consequent assymetric coaptation of the mitral 
leaflets and at least moderate-to-severe mitral regurgitation, 
directed posteriorly. Moderate pulmonary artery systolic 
hypertension. 
.

ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the 
severity of valvular regurgitation.] No masses or thrombi are 
seen in the left ventricle. Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an 
increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Right 
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The 
aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened (?#). No aortic 
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly 
thickened. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is 
mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no 
pericardial effusion. 

Echo ___
IMPRESSION: Normal left ventricular cavity size with extensive 
regional systolic dysfunction c/w multivessel CAD (mid-LAD and 
PDA distributions). Increased PCWP. Moderate mitral 
regurgitation. Pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.

CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: 
The left ventricular ejection fraction is <40%, a threshold for 
which the patient may benefit from a beta blocker and an ACE 
inhibotor or ___. 
Based on ___ AHA endocarditis prophylaxis recommendations, the 
echo findings indicate prophylaxis is NOT recommended. Clinical 
decisions regarding the need for prophylaxis should be based on 
clinical and echocardiographic data.  

Cardiac Catheterization: ___

1. Coronary angiography of this right dominant system 
demonstrated 2 
vessel coronary artery disease.  The ___ had a 40% distal 
stenosis. 
The LAD had a 90% proximal stenosis and a 30% mid-vessel 
stenosis.  The 
LCX had a 40% proximal stenosis.  The RCA was occluded 
proximally. 
There was left to right collaterals filling the distal RCA. 
2. Resting hemodynamics revealed elevated right and left sided 
filling 
pressures with a RVEDP of 11 mmHg and a mean PCWP of 25 mmHg.  
There was 
mild pulmonary arterial hypertension with a PA pressure of 41/25 
mmHg. 
Central aortic pressure was 125/55 mmHg.  The cardiac index was 
normal 
at 3.4 L/min/m2. 
3. Successful PTCA and placement of a 2.75x15mm Vision 
bare-metal stent 
were performed in the proximal LAD.  The stent was postdilated 
using a 
3.0mm diameter balloon.  Final angiography showed normal flow, 
no 
apparent dissection, and a 5% residual stenosis.  (See PTCA 
comments.) 
  
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:     
1. Two vessel coronary artery disease. 
2. Biventricular diastolic dysfunction. 
3. Mild pulmonary arterial hypertension. 
4. Placement of a bare-metal stent in the proximal LAD. 
.
___
Echo
The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall 
thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There is moderate 
regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with severe 
hypokinesis of the distal halves of the anterior septum, 
anterior and inferior walls as well as apex. The remaining 
segments contract normally (LVEF = ___ %). [Intrinsic left 
ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the 
severity of valvular regurgitation.] No masses or thrombi are 
seen in the left ventricle. Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an 
increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Right 
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The 
aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened (?#). No aortic 
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly 
thickened. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is 
mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no 
pericardial effusion. 

IMPRESSION: Normal left ventricular cavity size with extensive 
regional systolic dysfunction c/w multivessel CAD (mid-LAD and 
PDA distributions). Increased PCWP. Moderate mitral 
regurgitation. Pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.

CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: 
The left ventricular ejection fraction is <40%, a threshold for 
which the patient may benefit from a beta blocker and an ACE 
inhibotor or ___. 
Based on ___ AHA endocarditis prophylaxis recommendations, the 
echo findings indicate prophylaxis is NOT recommended. Clinical 
decisions regarding the need for prophylaxis should be based on 
clinical and echocardiographic data. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: ___ y/o woman s/p hip replacement now 
intubated for respiratory distress with ? PNA, noted on echo to 
have acutely worsened MR. 

___ Distress: The patient was intubated and sedated on 
arrival from the outside hospital. Her respiratory distress was 
initially thought secondary to PNA due to a LL opacity, however 
blood cultures were negative and antibiotics were stopped. It 
became evident that her respiratory distress was secondary to 
heart failure that had developed secondary to mitral 
regurgitation which was secondary to ischemia. Had echo prior to 
arrival showing new ___ apical wall motion abnormality which 
would suggest plaque in LAD. Had poor R wave progression and 
LAFSB which would be consistent with anterior ischemia but her 
ST depressions are in V5-V6 more consistent with ischemia 
involving Lcx.Her cardiac cath revealed LAD disease and a bare 
metal stent was placed. She will require plavix and high dose 
aspirin for a month. On Echocardiogram, she had apical akinesis. 
 We therefore are recommending that she remain anticoagulated 
for the next 6 months with coumadin. PTT/INR should be checked 
daily. She should follow up with the ___ clinic following 
discharge from rehab. 
. 
# HCT drop: HCT 32.2 on admission following 2U PRBC at ___. 
Concern at OSH was for RP bleed however no evidence of this 
clinically and HCT trended down slowly from 32 on admit and has 
been stable currently. An active type and screen was 
maintained,she was guaic negative.
.
#s/p Hip replacement: She  had a left hip replacement at an 
outside hospital. Communication with performing surgeon related 
that she was full weight bearing and she was evaluated by ___  
with a recommnedation for rehab. She felt as though her knee 
would buckle thus plain films of the left leg were taken and 
showed changes consistent with osteoarthritis. Her wound from 
her hip surgery should be kept covered at all times.  She is on 
lovenox bridge to coumadin currently and 
She will follow up with her orthopedic surgeon as scheduled 
within two weeks of the procedure.
