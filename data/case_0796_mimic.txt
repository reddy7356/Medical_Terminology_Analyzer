Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,

You were admitted to the hospital after a laparoscopic 
ileocecectomy for surgical management of your terminal ileal 
stricture. You have recovered from this procedure and you are 
now ready to return home.  

Please monitor your bowel function closely. You may or may not 
have had a bowel movement prior to discharge which is 
acceptable; however it is important that you have a bowel 
movement in the next ___ days. After anesthesia it is not 
uncommon for patients to have some decrease in bowel function 
but you should not have prolonged constipation. However, you may 
have loose stool and passing of small amounts of dark, old 
appearing blood. If you notice that you are passing bright red 
blood with bowel movements or having large amounts of loose 
stool without improvement please call the office or go to the 
emergency room. 

You have ___ laparoscopic surgical incisions on your abdomen 
which are closed with internal sutures.  It is important that 
you monitor these areas for signs and symptoms of infection 
including: increasing redness of the incision lines, 
white/green/yellow/foul smelling drainage, increased pain at the 
incision, increased warmth of the skin at the incision, or 
swelling of the area. You may shower; pat the incisions dry with 
a towel, do not rub.  If you have steri-strips (the small white 
strips), they will fall off over time, please do not remove 
them. Please do not take a bath or swim until cleared by the 
surgical team.

Pain is expected after surgery. This will gradually improve over 
the first week or so you are home.  You should continue to take 
2 Extra Strength Tylenol (___) for pain every 8 hours around 
the clock. Please do not take more than 3000mg of Tylenol in 24 
hours or any other medications that contain Tylenol such as cold 
medication. Do not drink alcohol while taking Tylenol.  You may 
also take Advil (Ibuprofen) 600mg every 8 hours for 7 days. 
Please take Advil with food. If these medications are not 
controlling your pain to a point where you can ambulate and 
perform minor tasks, you should take Gabapentin 300mg every 8 
hours. 

You may feel weak or "washed out" for up to 6 weeks after 
surgery. Do not lift greater than a gallon of milk for 3 weeks. 
At your post op appointment, your surgical team will clear you 
for heavier exercise.  In the meantime, you may climb stairs and 
go outside and walk.  Please avoid traveling long distances 
until you speak with your surgical team at your post-op visit.   


Thank you for allowing us to participate in your care, we wish 
you all the best!
