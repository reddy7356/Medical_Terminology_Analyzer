MRI/A of head and neck:
There is no evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage, mass, 
mass effect or shifting of the normally midline structures. The 
ventricles and sulci are slightly prominent, likely age related 
and involutional in nature. On T2 and FLAIR sequences, multiple 
foci of high signal intensity are identified in the subcortical 
and periventricular white matter, slightly larger on the left 
frontal region (image 18, series #3), measuring approximately 
10.1 x 15.5 mm in size, no diffusion abnormalities are detected 
to suggest acute/subacute ischemic changes. There is no evidence 
of magnetic susceptibility areas to indicate blood product 
deposits. Normal flow void signal is identified at the major 
vascular structures. The orbits, the paranasal sinuses and 
mastoid air cells are grossly unremarkable. 
  
IMPRESSION: There is no evidence of diffusion abnormalities to 
indicate 
acute/subacute ischemic changes. Multiple scattered foci of high 
signal intensity are demonstrated in the subcortical and 
periventricular white matter, indicating chronic microvascular 
ischemic disease, larger area of possible chronic ischemia is 
noted on the left frontal lobe, however if there is any other 
clinical concern, correlation with MRI with contrast is 
recommended if clinically warranted, there is no evidence of 
mass effect or hydrocephalus. 
  
MRA OF THE CIRCLE OF ___: There is evidence of vascular flow 
in both internal carotids as well as in the vertebrobasilar 
system with no evidence of vascular stenosis or aneurysms larger 
than 2 mm in size. 
  
IMPRESSION: Essentially normal MRA of the head. 
  
MRA OF THE NECK: 
The origin of the supra-aortic vessels appears normal, both 
common carotids as well as the vertebral arteries are patent, 
the cervical carotid bifurcations are normal with no evidence of 
flow or stenotic lesions and the vertebrobasilar system appears 
unremarkable. 
  
IMPRESSION: Essentially normal MRA of the neck. 

Echocardiogram:
Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved 
global and regional biventricular systolic function. No definite 
structural cardiac source of embolism identified.

EEG: Result pending but prelim read is normal with no evidence 
of discharges.
 
Brief Hospital Course:
Patient is a ___ yo RHM with hx of HTN and DM here after a brief 
episode of speech trouble where he had trouble remembering names 
then had jumbled speech where the words were enunciated 
correctly but were out of order.  Patient was asked to recite 
ABC's per family who was with him but he was not able to recite 
them in sequence hence he was taken to an outside hospital.  The 
episode lasted about 5 minutes per patient's family.

He was transferred here for possible stroke work-up.  He 
underwent MRI and MRA of the head and neck which showed multiple 
small vessel ischemic changes but no hyperintensity on DWI 
sequence to suggest a stroke.  There is a ~1cm x 1cm lesion in L 
frontal lobe that needs to be further elucidated.

His episode did not recur during his admission and he had an 
essentially normal exam except for a couple of paraphasic 
errors.  The speech trouble at home is unclear - possibly a 
seizure activity v. TIA.  He underwent EEG and echolcardiogram 
during this admission that were normal.

Given the unclear lesion in the R frontal lobe, he is scheduled 
to ___ with a MRI of head with contrast.  He will be 
following up with Dr. ___ in the clinic.  In the 
meantime, he is recommended to ___ with his PCP ___ 2 
weeks of discharge and consider starting a cholesterol lowering 
medication given his LDL of 116 and to optimize his diabetes 
control.

Discharge Disposition:
Home
 
Discharge Diagnosis:
Speech trouble of unspecified etiology - possible seizure
Small vessel disease
DM II 

 
Discharge Condition:
Mental Status: Clear and coherent.

Discharge Instructions:
You came to the hospital after an approximate 5 minute episode 
of "word salad," where you knew what you wanted to say, but the 
words were coming out in a mixed up order. An MRI of your head 
was performed as were imaging of the blood vessels of your head 
and neck. The imaging of your vessels was normal and there was 
no evidence of acute stroke or mass lesion on the MRI of your 
head, though there was evidence of small vessel disease. 

You also underwent echocardiogram and EEG.  The results of these 
tests will be reviewed with you per Dr. ___ the 
___ visit scheduled as listed below.

Your blood tests including hemoglobin A1C and lipid panel show 
that your diabetes is not ideally controlled and given your 
diabetes, you may benefit from taking a ___ 
medication.  Please speak to your PCP about starting 
___ medication when you ___ with him.  We 
recommend you see him within 1~2 weeks of discharge.
 
Followup Instructions:
___
