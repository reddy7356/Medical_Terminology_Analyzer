History of Present Illness:
This is a ___ year old female with HTN, thyroid disorder, s/p
mastectomy, who comes in with sensation of something stuck in 
her
throat after eating steak last night for dinner. 
 
Yesterday evening she states that she was eating her meal 
without
her dentures in and was therefore only using her front teeth to
chew steak. She states she may have swallowed a large piece and
this was followed with a sensation of something stuck in her
throat. This continued despite drinking water and she presented
to the ED.  

The patient states that she thinks this may have happened to her
once before about ___ years ago. She doesn't recall the details 
of
the occurrence and wasn't sure if she had an endoscopy for it or
not. She usually does not have issues with swallowing otherwise. 


In the ED, she was tolerating secretions and speaking coherently
without signs of respiratory distress. She was given glucagon 
and
Ativan, observed overnight in the ED. This AM, she was having
more difficulty tolerating secretions, so was taken by GI for an
EGD. During her EGD, patient reportedly suffered
bronchospasm/hypoxic decompensation requiring endotracheal
intubation.

ROS: Positives as per HPI; otherwise negative.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ is a ___ year old woman with HTN, thyroid disorder, 
s/p
mastectomy who presented with concern for food impaction.

ACUTE ISSUES
===============
# Food Impaction
Steak impacted in the upper ___ of the esophagus, s/p EGD 
removal (after intubation and ___ EGD as below. GI recommended 
PPI 40mg PO BID and repeat EGD in 1 month. Etiology is thought 
to be secondary to patient removing dentures (new dentures that 
were causing irritation) before eating her steak. Per patient, a 
similar incident happened ___ years prior when she removed her 
dentures. She was discharged with Pantoprazole 40 mg PO Q12H to 
be continued for 1 month before getting a repeat EGD.

# Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure. During ___ attempted EGD, 
patient had bronchospasm/hypoxemic respiratory failure and a 
code blue was called. s/p intubation ___ and was subsequently 
extubated on the same day. CXR after acute respiratory event 
showed new left lower lobe collapse and bronchoscopy showed 
purulent secretions in the left airways that were suctioned. 
Post bronchoscopy CXR showed re-expansion of the lung. WBC was 
elevated but decreased day by day reducing the suspicion for 
aspiration PNA. Discharge CBC:11.

# Urinary Retention. Chronic urinary retention. She performs 
intermittent self-catheterization at home. On transfer to MICU, 
unable to self-catheterize and nurses were unable to straight 
cath. Foley placed by urology after needing to wire urethra. She 
was originally planned to have a f/u appointment with her 
outpatient urologist to remove foley but the foley fell out 
during ___ on the day of discharge. She was able to self-cath on 
the day of discharge with no complications. Please ensure that 
she can still continue to self-cath without any issues.

CHRONIC ISSUES
===============
#Anxiety
-Briefly held Alprazolam 0.5mg TID PRN:anxiety given somnolence
-Paroxetine 10mg QD

#Hypothyroid
-Levothyroxine 50mcg QD

#HLD
-Simvastatin 20mg QHS

#HTN
-Held home atenolol 100mg daily and amlodipine 10mg daily in the
setting of relative hypotension

___ Breast CA s/p mastectomy
-Letrozole 2.5mg QD

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
=====================
[ ] Please check her CBC and ensure that it is downtrending. 
Follow up respiratory symptoms for concern for potential 
aspiration pneumonia
[ ] Ensure that she gets proper fitting dentures
[ ] Please ensure that she can still continue to self-cath 
without any issues

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,  

It was a pleasure to care for you at the ___ 
___.  

Why did I come to the hospital?
- You came to the hospital after swallowing a large piece of 
steak.

What happened while I was in the hospital?
- You had a procedure called an upper endoscopy or EGD 
(esophagogastroduodenoscopy) where a camera is placed down your 
feeding tube (esophagus). We saw a large portion of impacted 
food.
- During this procedure you stopped being able to breath on your 
own. You had an endotracheal tube placed down your throat 
(intubation) and you were placed on a ventilator to help you 
breathe.
- Your EGD was resumed and our gastroenterologists were able to 
dislodge the impacted food from your esophagus.
- After the procedure you were found to have partial collapse of 
the lower lobe of your left lung. This may have contributed to 
your difficulty breathing during the procedure.
- While intubated our interventional pulmonologists took a look 
with a bronchoscope in your airways and helped re-inflate your 
lung. 
- You were soon extubated and breathed well on your own.

What should I do once I leave the hospital?
- Please take your medications and go to your appointments as 
described in this discharge summary.
- If you experience any of the danger signs listed below, please 
call your primary care physician or present to the emergency 
department immediately. 

We wish you the best! 

Your ___ Care Team
