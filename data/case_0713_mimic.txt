PATHOLOGY: None
 
Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the acute care surgery service on 
___ for management of multiple traumatic injuries associated 
with motor vehicle collision.  Patient arrived via medflight as 
transfer from OSH intubated.  ATLS protocol initiated and 
patient had clinical course as follows: 
Admitted to the Trauma ICU.
Neuro: Patient arrived intubated/sedated from OSH.  Sedation 
regimen adjusted over course of intubation to minimize 
hypotension secondary to sedation.  Remained intubated for 
multiple orthopedic procedures and was extubated without 
incident ___.  Chronic pain service was consulted ___ who made 
recommendations regarding patient's analgesic regimen.  Regimen 
consisted of long/short acting narcotics as well as topical 
anesthetic creams for road rash.  Regimen was effective and well 
tolerated.

Noted to have multiple cervical fractures as noted above though 
no focal neurologic deficits.  Patient was kept on logroll 
precautions related to this.  Patient was brought to OR by ortho 
spine ___ for cervical fusion which was tolerated well.  Given 
c-spine injuries vascular imaging of neck was pursued that 
showed dissection of R vertebral artery with occlusion over 4cm 
segment at level of C4.  Logroll was discontinued following 
surgical stabilization.  A soft collar was recommended until she 
is evaluated at her follow up appointment.  Neuro-stroke and 
neurosurgery were consulted regarding management of this who 
recommended ASA 325 daily for six months with a follow up MRA in 
three months time.  

CV: On arrival the patient was hypovolemic with hypotension and 
oliguria.  Patient was resuscitated with multiple boluses of 
crystalloid IVF over first 48 hours of admission.  Four units 
pRBCs (2 in ED, 2 in TSICU) were transfused on HD#1 with 
stabilization of Hct following this.  Three additional units 
pRBC were transfused ___ as hct drifted down from 32 (___) to 
___.  Hct bumped appropriately and hct remained stable 
throughout remainder of admission.  The patient was persistently 
in sinus tachycardia throughout admission with pulse ranging 
from 100s to 110s.  The patient was stable from a cardiovascular 
standpoint; vital signs were routinely monitored.

Pulmonary: On arrival patient was intubated and noted to have a 
L pneumothorax and B/L pulmonary contusions.  Left chest tube 
was placed in the ED.  ET tube was upsized ___ as 6.5 tube was 
placed in field.  Chest tube was removed ___ upon extubation.  
Pulmonary toilet including incentive spirometry.  The patient 
was stable from a pulmonary standpoint; vital signs were 
routinely monitored.

GI/GU: On arrival patient was resuscitated as above.  Patient 
was given IV fluids until tolerating oral intake.  Tube feeds 
via OGT were initiated ___.  These were tolerated well.  OGT 
was removed ___.  Regular diet was started ___ following 
extubation and patient tolerated this without issue.  Extensive 
bowel regimen was given secondary to narcotic usage and passed 
bowel movements without issue.  

Liver laceration was sustained at time of injury though no 
active extravasation was seen on CT scan.  Serial hcts were 
monitored as above.  Transfusions administered though unlikely 
that blood loss was related to hepatic injury.  LFTs were noted 
to be elevated ___ though this was as expected given known 
injury.  

Foley was placed at OSH and maintained until ___.  Currently 
she is voiding without difficulty.  Lasix was given ___ to 
assist in diuresis and this had good effect.  Patient 
auto-diuresed following this.  Intake and output were closely 
monitored.

MSK: Patient had injuries as listed above including c-spine 
fractures (see neuro), sternoclavicular dislocations 
bilaterally, pelvic fractures and degloving of L ___.  Patient 
was taken to OR by ortho for anterior pelvic ex fix and 
posterior ORIF ___ and this was tolerated well.  Displaced 
right sternoclavicular joint was reduced as well secondary to 
compression of adjacent subclavian artery and vein.  Mediastinal 
hematoma was stable both pre and post procedure.  Weight bearing 
status at that time was non-weight bearing in B/L lower 
extremities.  Returned to OR ___ for repair of proximal L 
humerus fracture and patient was kept non-weight bearing in 
upper extremities as well. She is however able to feed herself 
with her right hand. 

She developed a thrombocytosis over the last ___ days likely a 
reaction to her multiple trauma and operations.  Currently her 
platelet count is in the 1200 range and she is on 325 mg aspirin 
daily which will continue.

Podiatry initially followed patient for superficial injuries to 
left foot.  Their recommendations for wound management were 
followed.  Plastic surgery was also consulted for management of 
exposed tendon and have recommended operative managment. Care of 
this was then assumed by Plastics. She was taken to the 
Operating Room on ___ and ___ for debridement, closure then 
skin grafting to the dorsum of the left foot. See formal op note 
for details.  She tolerated the procedures well with minimal 
pain.  The donor site is clean and healing well and the left 
foot is healing well with the graft pink without drainage.

Physical therapy and Occupational therapy services were 
consulted and followed her closely during her stay to maintain 
some functional mobility,and review transfers.  she will need 
vigorous therapy once she is able to increase her weight bearing 
status. 

ID: Perioperative antibiotics were administered as appropriate 
for patient's procedures.  No signs of infection were present 
during this admission.  The patient's temperature was closely 
watched for signs of infection.

Prophylaxis: Given mediastinal hematoma and concern for bleed 
the patient was maintained with SCDs only until ___.  LENIs 
performed B/L ___ ___ and these were negative for DVT.  They 
were performed again on ___ to the left leg as she 
complained of left calf pain however they were again negative. 
Given concern for immobility during recovery period an IVC 
filter was placed ___.  GI prophylaxis was given until 
tolerating regular diet.  

At the time of discharge on ___, the patient was doing well, 
afebrile with stable vital signs, tolerating a regular diet and 
her pain was well controlled.
