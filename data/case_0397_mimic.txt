>> IMAGING
L-spine CT ___
1. Diffuse demineralization.
2. Loss of vertebral body heights at the T8, T11 and T12 levels 
of
approximately 30% anteriorly. Small prevertebral hematoma at the 
T11 is noted concerning for acute process. Minimal retropulsion 
of the superior endplate with mild effacement of thecal sac.
3. Small hiatal hernia.
4. Markedly distended bladder.
.
MRI L- AND T-SPINE: 
IMPRESSION:  
There is diffuse enhancement of the vertebral bodies throughout 
the spine 
after contrast administration . In the setting of myeloma and 
given the 
diffuse demineralization noted on the CT, this finding strongly 
suggests 
diffuse tumor infiltration 
.
SKELETAL SURVEY: 
1. Multiple compression deformities in the spine as detailed 
above. These are  nonspecific and may be due to demineralization 
or neoplastic infiltration.  A  definite lytic lesion is not 
identified in the spine. 
2. There is a possible lucent lesion left proximal femur.

>> ACTIVE ISSUES
# Monoclonal IgA kappa gammopathy: found on SPEP as part of 
workup for pathologic fractures (associated with elevated 
quantitative IgA and suppressed IgG), concerning for 
MGUS/multiple myeloma. Pt with associated mild normocytic anemia 
and mild hypercalcemia.  UPEP without evidence of protein. Free 
light chains pending at time of discharge. Renal function wnl. 
Patient underwent skeletal survey, as well as further MRI 
thoracic and lumbar spine. Skeletal survery with multiple 
compression deformities in the spine described as nonspecific 
and may be due to demineralization or neoplastic infiltration.  
No definite lytic lesion was identified in the spine. A possible 
lucent lesion was seen in the left proximal femur. MRI 
demonstrated   diffuse enhancement of the vertebral bodies 
throughout the spine strongly suggestive of diffuse tumor 
infiltration 
He was set up to see oncology in close f/u as an outpatient on 
___.  
[] Follow-up free light chains pending at time of discharge.
.
# T8,T11, and T12 compression fractures: Ortho/spine was 
consulted and felt there was no indication for surgery. 
Follow-up MRI spine, ordered prior to discharge in oncologic 
work-up for lytic lesions, demonstrated progressive thoracic 
compression fracture. Reviewed imaging with ortho prior to d/c 
and again no surgical intervention needed. 
His pain was controlled with oxycodone, diazepam to relax his 
muscles and he wore a TLSO brace. He was evaluated by ___ who 
felt he was safe to go home.  Given compression fractures are 
very atypical in men who are ___ who and otherwise healthy a 
workup was started which ultimately revealed the above 
monoclonal IgA kappa.  He also had normal PSA, normal 
testosterone, low vit D (started on repletion), elevated Ca, 
normal PTH. Given insufficient pain control with frequent 
oxyocodone Q4H, low dose oxycontin was started prior to 
discharge. He was also discharged with PRN oxycodone and 
diazepam.
[] Consider bisphosphonate as an outpatient
.
# Hypercalcemia: relatively mild in 10.6-10.9 range. Could be 
related to myeloma per above. PTH on low side of normal 
suggesting mild suppression. Vit D low and so vit D 
supplementation prescribed for which Ca should be monitored 
closely in outpt f/u.
.
>> TRANSITIONAL ISSUES
# Free kappa/lambda, MRI reads and skeletal survey reads pending 
at time of discharge
# Pt to f/u with PCP and ___ onc
# Please continue to monitor pain control and adjust medications 
as needed
# Please monitor calcium levels at f/u and consider lowering Vit 
D supplementation if hypercalcemia worsens.
# PCP to arrange for spine f/u in the ___ system.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr ___,

  It was a pleasure caring for you at ___. You were admitted 
because of bone pain and were found to have multiple small 
fractures in the bones of your spine, called compression 
fractures. You were seen by the spine doctors who did not feel 
you needed surgery. You were given pain meds and evaluated by 
physical therapy and it was felt you were safe to be discharged 
home. Your bones overall were found to be thin on the CAT scan 
you had.  It is unusual to see fractures of this nature in 
someone of your age and gender.  Therefore, you underwent workup 
with additional testing to check and see if there is an 
underlying disease that would cause your bones to be thin.  Your 
blood tests indicate that you have an abnormal protein, 
concerning for a cancer called multiple myeloma.  We did some 
extra blood tests and imaging to better evaluate this.  We have 
set you up with Dr. ___ in Oncology through ___, 
who will see you on ___ to discuss the plan going forward.

We also found an elevated "TTG" or transglutaminase antibody, 
which can indicate Celiac disease, but yours was very 
borderline. Please discuss with your doctor once all the lab 
results are back whether you should pursue further workup for 
Celiac.  We also found that your vitamin D is low (for which we 
started you on supplementation).

Because your calcium is slightly high, be sure to drink plenty 
of fluids at home.

Wear your back brace at home when out of bed with activity.

We wish you the best.

T8, 11 and 12, now on bortezomib, dexamethasone and lenalidomide 
(started bortezomib/dex on ___ and lenalidomide ___ who 
is admitted to ___ in the setting of worsening back pain and 
concern for cord compression. 

Pt states that he was feeling well until approximately 6 weeks 
ago when he developed lower back pain. He initially thought this 
was related to muscle strain and was treated with muscle 
relaxant and ibuprofen without improvement. Approximately 2 
weeks ago he developed sudden onset severe low back pain while 
pumping gas at gas station that caused him to collapse. He was 
subsequently admitted to ___ from ___ for back pain. 
During that admission he was found to have compression fractures 
described above that were thought to be the cause of his back 
pain. His CBC was consistent with mild anemia, elevated calcium, 
Cr of 1.2 and SPEP showing IgA lambda with M spike of 1850 
mg/dL. Bone marrow biopsy revealed plasma cells comprising 80% 
of cellularity. Mr. ___ was discharged home where he 
followed up with ___ Oncology. He was started on Bortezomib/dex 
on ___ and then lenalidomide on ___.

After discharge home, pt reported that he was doing well until 2 
days prior to admission when he developed recurrent severe back 
pain, nausea and vomiting. His pain was so severe he was unable 
to get OOB. Denies any even minor trauma that may have 
precipitated the pain. Reports using his TLSO brace at home. No 
fevers, chills, bowel or bladder incontinence or saddle 
anesthesia. He was taking oxycodone and oxycontin at home for 
pain control. 

He presented to the ED for evaluation of his back pain where he 
had CT spine that revealed known compression fractures, T12 
retropulsion with severe canal stenosis and several bony 
demineralization throughout. Exam was notable for hyperreflexia 
without other focal neuro deficits. Ortho spine was consulted in 
the ED with recommendation for MRI of the spine and admission to 
Oncology. 

On the floor he described persistent back pain without new or 
worsening symptoms.

IMAGING
=======
___: CT T-SPINE WITHOUT CONTRAST
IMPRESSION:  
1.  Compared with prior exam from approximately 2 weeks prior 
there has been new complete collapse of the vertebral body of 
T12 with bony retropulsion resulting in severe spinal canal 
stenosis at this level. 
2.  Approximately 30% compression deformity at T8 and T11 is 
unchanged from prior. Mild spinal canal stenosis at the level of 
T11 is redemonstrated. 
3.  Severe and diffuse demineralization in keeping with known 
history of 
multiple myeloma.  
4.  Interval acute fracture of the medial left tenth rib. 

___: CT L-SPINE WITHOUT CONTRAST
IMPRESSION: 
1.  New compression deformity of L2 compared with exam from 
approximately 2 weeks prior. There is no retropulsion of bony 
fragments or spinal canal stenosis at these levels.   
2.  Unchanged superior endplate depression of L3 and compression 
deformity of L5 with minimal retropulsion and mild spinal canal 
stenosis at this level. 
3.  No significant degenerative changes and no evidence of 
spinal canal or neural foraminal narrowing allowing for 
limitations of CT.
4.  Severe bony demineralization in keeping with known history 
of multiple myeloma. 
5.  Incompletely characterized lesion off the upper pole of the 
left kidney with indeterminate Hounsfield units. Consider 
non-urgent ultrasound to more fully evaluate. 

___: MRI THORACIC AND LUMBAR SPINE
IMPRESSION:  
1.  In comparison with the prior examination, and there has been 
mild interval progression of the compression fracture at T12 
vertebral body, causing moderate to severe central spinal canal 
narrowing, no focal or diffuse lesions are noted throughout the 
thoracic spinal cord. 
2. Heterogeneous signal throughout the thoracic and lumbar 
vertebral bodies with minimal punctate areas of enhancement, 
which appears unchanged, suggestive of bone marrow infiltration 
from multiple myeloma. 
3. Minimal increased compression deformity at L2 vertebral body, 
with no 
significant retropulsion.  Unchanged L3 and L5 vertebral body 
fractures. 
4.  Degenerative changes appear unchanged at the level of L4/L5 
with disc 
bulging and mild retropulsion of the superior endplate of L5, 
causing moderate central canal narrowing and bilateral neural 
foraminal narrowing as described above. 

___: CHEST X-RAY (PORTABLE AP)
IMPRESSION:  
Small left apical pneumothorax is present with left-sided chest 
tube in place. Tip of endotracheal tube terminates 7.3 cm above 
the carinal and could be advanced for standard positioning. 
Cardiomediastinal contours are normal considering marked patient 
rotation. Lungs are grossly clear.

___: CHEST X-RAY (PORTABLE AP)
IMPRESSION:   
1. Left chest tube present, similar in position. No pneumothorax 
detected. 
2. There is minimal hazy opacity at the left lung base, slightly 
increased. This is non-specific in appearance and could 
represent atelectasis, parenchymal contusion, or early pneumonic 
infiltrate. Attention to this area on followup films is 
requested. 

___: CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
IMPRESSION:    
Large left pleural effusion has increased substantially since 
___. 
Consolidation in the right lower lobe is considerably larger 
also, probably worsening pneumonia. Vascular engorgement in the 
upper lobes and mediastinum suggest biventricular cardiac 
decompensation. Obscuration of the left heart border could be 
due to pleural effusion or new consolidation in the lingula. 

___: CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
Right PICC line tip is at the level of mid SVC. Widespread 
consolidations are unchanged. The was interval planned placement 
of the left pigtail with subsequent decrease in the left pleural 
effusion. There is small left apical pneumothorax present. 
  
Note is made of substantially distended stomach. 
  
Right lower lobe consolidation is extensive and might 
potentially represent a combination of pneumonia with 
atelectasis. 

___: T-SPINE X-RAY, L-SPINE X-RAY
The limited view of the chest demonstrate widespread parenchymal 

consolidations, highly concerning for multifocal infection, 
unchanged since the prior study. The appearance of the spine 
both thoracic and lumbar (lumbar spine is postsurgical) is 
unchanged but there is substantial interval development of bowel 
wall distension that might be consistent with ileus or 
obstruction. Dedicated assessment of the abdomen is highly 
recommended.

___: PORTABLE ABDOMEN X-RAY
Increasing dilation of air and stool-filled colon, without 
radiographic 
evidence of wall thickening to suggest toxic megacolon.  The 
presence of 
intra-abdominal free air cannot be evaluated on these supine 
views. However, if there is continued clinical concern, CT can 
be obtained.

___: CHEST X-RAY (PORTABLE AP)
IMPRESSION:    
Right PICC line tip is at the level of lower SVC. Pigtail 
catheter is in 
place.  Widespread parenchymal consolidations are unchanged. 
Overall the 
appearance is similar to previous examination except for 
interval distended of the stomach and progression of bowel 
distention. 

___: PORTABLE ABDOMEN X-RAY
IMPRESSION:    
As compared to ___ radiograph, diffuse colonic 
distention is 
relatively similar, with only minimal decrease in extent in the 
ascending 
colon and increase in the descending colon. The gas and stool 
are again 
demonstrated within the colon.  Scattered air-filled loops of 
small bowel are also present.  If free intraperitoneal air is 
suspected clinically, upright chest radiograph for left lateral 
decubitus abdominal view would be recommended. 

___: RENAL ULTRASOUND
IMPRESSION: 
1. Simple left renal cyst corresponds to the structure seen on 
the prior CT. 
2. Scant trace of ascites and trace right pleural effusion also 
noted. 

CYTOLOGY
========
___: PLEURAL FLUID
Diagnosis: Negative for malignant cells. Mesothelial cells and 
macrophages. 
 
Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ is a ___ M with PMHx significant for newly 
diagnosed IgA lambda multiple myeloma who presented with 
worsening back pain in the setting of a known compression 
fracture found be hyperreflexic on exam with worsening 
retropulsion of T12 w/canal stenosis and cord compression on 
MRI.  Given that he had no weakness or sensory deficit, Ortho 
Spine (Dr. ___ felt no need for emergency surgery but 
patient elected to undergo surgery to correct the displaced 
vertebrae during this admission. While awaiting the surgery, he 
was treated with dexamethasone, antiemetics and pain control.
 
# Compression fracture/spinal cord compression:  CT of thoracic 
and lumbar spine on ___ revealed collapse of T12 with 
retropulsion and canal stenosis at this level as well as 
previous known compression fractures.  MRI of spine performed 
for further investigation revealed canal narrowing in the same 
area concerning for cord compression, however based on 
examination there was no need for urgent radiation/oncology. 
Patient underwent elective spinal fusion and underwent a 
corpectomy and anterior fusion on ___.  The procedure was 
complicated by significant blood loss secondary to extensive 
epidural bleeding encountered during surgery.  Patient was 
transferred to the ICU intubated for close monitoring of 
blood/fluid volume.  He was transfused with multiple units of 
pRBCs.  On ___, he returned to the operating room for an 
uncomplicated posterior fusion scheduled as part of a staged 
2-part procedure. A hemovac drain that was placed at the time of 
surgery was removed on POD#2. A TLSO brace was fitted for 
comfort and support. Physical therapy was consulted for 
mobilization. On ___, patient was transfused another 2 units 
of pRBCs secondary to post-operative blood loss anemia. At the 
time of discharge H/H was stable for approximately 1 week. 
Patient's pain was well-controlled, initially on a PCA, and 
later on oral pain medications. He will require follow-up with 
Dr. ___ Orthopedics/Spine at ___ 
___ within 2 weeks following discharge from the hospital. 

# Sepsis ___ Healthcare Associated Pneumonia:  Several days 
post-operatively, patient developed worsening hypoxia, 
tachycardia, and hypotension consistent with sepsis.  A CXR 
revealed a worsening RLL infiltrate consistent with HCAP (given 
prolonged hospital course) as well as a large left-sided pleural 
effusion.  Patient was started on vancomycin/cefepime for HCAP.  
Given worsening hypoxia, patient underwent a thoracentesis and 
chest tube placement by IP with drainage of 800cc exudative 
fluid.  The chest tube was removed one day later. He initially 
required supplemental O2, however, after drainage of the left 
pleural effusion and completing 8 day antibiotic course of 
vancomycin/cefepime for HCAP (end date ___, he was weaned 
off oxygen and was saturating well on room air. Pleural fluid 
culture and specimens revealed no growt. He will require 
follow-up appointment with Dr. ___ at ___ 
___ within ___ weeks. This  is scheduled 
for ___ at 9:30 AM. 

# C. diff/ileus:  Patient developed worsening 
constipation/abdominal distension in the setting of narcotic 
pain medications.  He also began to report bloody bowel 
movements.  C. diff returned positive and patient was started on 
PO vancomycin at 125 mg PO Q6H. Patient continued to have absent 
of bowel movements. A KUB revealed colonic distension but no 
evidence of toxic megacolon.  It was unclear if his ileus was 
the result of C. diff or due to opioid-induced constipation. 
Infectious Disease was curbsided who believed given his 
immunosuppression s/p chemotherapy, multiple myeloma, and 
antibiotics for HCAP as he should be treated for 
severe/complicated C. difficile. Per curbside with Infectious 
Disease C. diff treatment was uptitrated to include IV 
metronidazole, and PO vancomycin was increased to 500 mg PO Q6H. 
Although patient had abdominal distension, patient appeared in 
no acute distress, with normal WBC, absent fever, and lack of 
abdominal tenderness. Although abdomen was distended, non-tender 
to palpation and patient did not appear septic. Patient 
continued to have abdominal distension, decreased bowel sounds 
consistent with ileus, however, given immunosuppression decision 
was made for Gastroenterology consultation for further 
evaluation/management. Gastroenterolgoy believed the abdominal 
distension was likely related to ileus (secondary to his acute 
illness, and narcotics for back pain). They recommended 
downtitrating narcotics and increasing bowel regimen. After 
decrease in narcotics and increase in bowel regimen, patient 
began developing normal bowel movements with resolution of his 
abdominal distension. Per GI, patient's treatment for c. 
difficile was downtitrated with discontinuation of IV 
metronidazole, and decrease of vancomycin dose from 500 gm PO 
Q6H to 125 mg PO Q6H. He is set to continue antibiotic treatment 
for c. difficile infection with end date ___. Pain 
medication regimen at the time of discharge: Morphine SR 15 mg 
PO Q12H, hydromorphone 2 mg PO Q6H:PRN pain. Bowel regimen at 
the time of discharge: docusate sodium 100 mg PO BID, senna 8.6 
mg PO BID:PRN constipation. 

Of note, during hospitalization, patient received 
methylnaltrexone x 2 given concern of opioid induced 
ileus/constipation.       
 
# Multiple Myeloma: Patient was diagnosed in ___ after 
presenting with spinal compression fractures as described above. 
 Work-up revealed IgA lambda on SPEP with M spike. He 
established care with Atrius Oncology (Dr. ___ and 
had started treatment with Velcade and Revlimid as an outpatient 
prior to admission.  His CBC was trended during his 
hospitalization and remained stable.  Radiation Oncology was

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___, 

You were admitted to ___ 
because you were having back pain. While you were here you had 
several imaging studies including an MRI of your spine that 
showed one of your disks was bulging into the area of your 
spinal cord. You also had multiple compression fractures of your 
back. As we discussed, these fractures were a result of 
weakening of your bones from your multiple myeloma. You were 
initially followed by the Oncology team and continued treatment 
before surgery. You were then transferred to the Orthopedic 
Surgery service for your back surgery. You underwent the back 
surgery.

During hospitalization, you experienced an infection of the 
lungs called healthcare associated pneumonia. You were treated 
with antibiotics for this infection. You also had a chest tube 
to drain inflammation from the lung. This helped improve your 
symptoms and your breathing improved. 

You were also noted to have abdominal distension during 
hospitalization associated with bloody bowel movements. You were 
tested for an infection of your stool which came back positive 
for C. difficile. You were treated for the C. difficile 
infection with an antibiotic called vancomycin. Your bowel 
regimen was also increased to help you move your bowels. These 
treatment regimens improved your abdominal discomfort. Please 
continue to take vancomycin 125 mg PO EVERY 6 HOURS with the end 
date on ___. 

You will have follow-up appointments with your 
Hematologist/Oncologist Dr. ___, surgeon Dr. ___ 
___, and the lung doctors as noted below.

Please note when attempting to get out of bed, you will need to 
put on the TLSO brace while laying down before getting out of 
bed. You will also require the TLSO brace when walking.

History of Present Illness:
Mr. ___ is a ___ M with recent diagnosis of IgA lambda 
multiple myeloma Durie-Salmon III. His initial presentation in 
___ was worsening back pain. He had mild back pain for 
several weeks, but on ___ developed acute back pain that 
brought him to ER. CT spine showed severe
demineralization with acute T8, T11, and T12 compression 
fractures, he was treated conservatively. Further workup: 
skeletal films confirmed the spinal fractures and also showed a 
1 cm lucency in the left femur in the proximal shaft. Blood work 
showed a new mild anemia with borderline elevated calcium of
10.9, with a creat of 1.2 and an IgA lambda  monoclonal spike of 
2219 with abnormal Kappa/Lamba light chains 5.1/595. Bone marrow 
performed by Dr. ___ on ___ was consistent with 
involvement by  multiple myeloma with 80% plasma cells.

He has IgA myeloma that historically had worse prognosis. His 
cytogenetics showed hyperdiploid karyotype that puts him into 
standard risk group. He achieved stringent CR by paraprotein 
considering that the light chains ratio is normal. He had very 
difficult and prolonged hospital stay secondary to his
compression fracture and spinal surgery. He has recovered from 
this prolonged illness. Clinically, he is doing better therefore 
as long as his multiple myeloma is responding to treatment we 
should proceed to high dose chemotherapy with stem cell rescue, 
followed by maintenance lenalidomide (if off study). The most 
recent data support high dose chemotherapy as the best treatment
option for patient younger than ___ years old. (Autologous

Discharge Instructions:
Dear  Mr. ___
You were admitted for an autologous stem cell transplant. 

You had a fever and mouth pain while your blood counts were low. 
We did a work up including blood testing, urine testing, and 
chest x rays which did not find a source of infection. You were 
placed on antibiotics for your fever spikes and your fevers 
resolved. 

You also developed nausea, diarrhea and loss of appetite while 
you were admitted. These are common side effects after 
transplant and your symptoms continue to improve.

Your nausea medications are as follows:
1 zofran
2 Ativan
3 zyprexa

You will continue to take acyclovir to prevent infection. You 
will start to take Bactrim to prevent a certain type of 
pneumonia once your counts have fully recovered. Your outpatient 
provider ___ tell you when to start this. 

Please take your temperature twice a day, and call us if it goes 
above 100.4.  Please be sure to drink at least 2L (64oz) of 
fluid daily. Call if you are unable to do so, or if you have 
worsening nausea or watery stools.

It has been a pleasure taking care of you.
