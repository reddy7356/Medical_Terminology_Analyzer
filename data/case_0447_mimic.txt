MRCP (MR ABD ___ ___ 
Findings:
1.  Minimal anterior pancreatic and peripancreatic edema, likely 
from reported recent episode of mild pancreatitis.  No 
pseudocyst. 
2.  11 mm cystic lesion arising from the pancreatic head could 
represent a small IPMN. While irregularity and mild dilation of 
the main pancreatic duct of 5 mm could reflect a combined-type 
IPMN, a side-branch IPMN with 
superimposed chronic pancreatitis is favored as the downstream 
duct appears is less prominent. A focal dilated side branch 
could also be considered. Correlate with EUS and consider 
followup MRCP to reassess the duct after resolution of reported 
recent episode of acute pancreatitis. 
3.  Small calcification or stone arising from the upper pole of 
the left 
kidney. No collecting system obstruction. Malrotated right 
kidney located 
within the pelvis.

lesions. 
3. Partially imaged tiny right pleural effusion. 
4. Small, but otherwise normal, right kidney. 
 
Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ was transferred to ___ from ___ on 
___ for workup of recurrent acute pancreatitis which 
initially presented as band-like epigastric pain. He was 
transferred to ___ for concern of a cystic mass seen on MRCP. 
On Day 1 he underwent EUS on ___ which did not show any 
mass.  On Day 2 he was advanced to a clear liquid diet but was 
unable to tolerate and had to be maintained NPO. The following 
day however, he was tolerating clears and advanced to fulls and 
ultimately a low-fat regular diet which he tolerated with 
minimal pain. 

While admitted, Mr. ___ underwent work-up of the cystic 
lesion seen on his MRCP concerning for IPMN. His endoscopic 
ultrasound was negative for any mass and was consistent with 
pancreatitis. His tumor markers were within normal limits. His 
IgG4 was normal. In regards to his pain, he underwent an 
ultrasound which did not show gallstones. HIDA with ejection 
fraction was normal. His pain was well controlled upon 
discharge.

___ Transthoracic echo:
CONCLUSION:
The left atrial volume index is normal. The right atrium is 
mildly enlarged. There is no evidence for an atrial septal 
defect by 2D/color Doppler. The estimated right atrial pressure 
is ___ mmHg. There is normal left ventricular wall thickness 
with a normal cavity size. There is mild regional left 
ventricular systolic dysfunction with hypokinesis of the distal 
inferior, septal and anterior walls and apex (see schematic) and 
preserved/normal contractility of the remaining segments. No 
left ventricular aneurysm is seen. Quantitative biplane
left ventricular ejection fraction is 48 % (normal 54-73%). Left 
ventricular cardiac index is low normal(2.0-2.5 L/min/m2). There 
is no resting left ventricular outflow tract gradient. Normal 
right ventricular cavity size with normal free wall motion. 
Tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE) is normal. 
The aortic sinus diameter is normal for gender with normal 
ascending aorta diameter for gender. The aortic arch
diameter is normal with a normal descending aorta diameter. 
There is no evidence for an aortic arch coarctation. The aortic 
valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. There is no aortic 
valve stenosis. There is a
centrally directed jet of mild [1+] aortic regurgitation. The 
mitral valve leaflets appear structurally normal with no mitral 
valve prolapse. There is mild [1+] mitral regurgitation. The 
pulmonic valve leaflets are normal. The tricuspid valve leaflets 
appear structurally normal. There is physiologic tricuspid 
regurgitation. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure 
is normal. There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Normal left ventricular cavity size with mild 
regional systolic dysfunction most consistent with single vessel 
coronary artery disease (mid to distal wraparound LAD 
distribution).
Mild aortic regurgitation with mildly thickened leaflets. Mild 
mitral regurgitation with normal valve morphology.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ was admitted under cardiology. Given findings of 
multi-vessel coronary artery disease, cardiac surgery was 
consulted and additional evaluation was performed. He remained 
pain free on medical therapy and was eventually cleared for 
surgery.

The patient was brought to the Operating Room on ___ where 
the patient underwent coronary artery bypass grafting by Dr. 
___ - see operative note for details.  Overall the patient 
tolerated the procedure well and post-operatively was 
transferred to the CVICU in stable condition for recovery and 
invasive monitoring.  
POD 1 found the patient extubated, alert and oriented and 
breathing comfortably.  The patient was neurologically intact 
and hemodynamically stable. The patient remained in the 
intensive care unit for two days on Neosynephrine for 
hypotension. Chest tubes were discontinued without complication 
Once blood pressure normalized, the patient was transferred to 
the telemetry floor for further recovery. Beta blocker was 
initiated and the patient was gently diuresed toward the 
preoperative weight. Pacing wires were removed without 
complication once patient was tolerating beta blocker. The 
patient was evaluated by the Physical Therapy service for 
assistance with strength and mobility.  By the time of discharge 
on POD 5 the patient was ambulating freely, the wound was 
healing and pain was controlled with oral analgesics.  The 
patient was discharged home with ___ services in good condition 
with appropriate follow up instructions.
