Chief Complaint:
Hypercalcemia, transfer from OSH
 
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
___ - US-guided biopsy of soft tissue metastasis by ___
 
History of Present Illness:
___ with PMHx of HTN, HLD, DM, h/o diverticulosis, who
presented ___ with several weeks of R arm pain, lethargy, 
unsteady gait, to PCP. He had also noticed 20 pound 
unintentional weight loss, slowed gait, and general decline in 
functional status.  He has been fatigued, and had trouble 
staying steady on his feet.  He had a fall, without syncope, at 
work when he ended up on the floor.  The arm pain was initially 
attributed to a flu shot but persisted for several weeks.  He 
also endorsed nocturia which he felt was due to diabetes.  Labs 
were done, he was found to have elevated Calcium to 14, and was 
sent to ___.

At ___, Calcium 15.1 -> 14 -> 11.9 with IVF, calcitonin. 
Also found to have ___ (Cr 2.2->1.8->1.47). CT head showed R 
cerebral edema with concern for underlying mass, and MRI brain 
showed evidence of multiple metastatic lesions. It was discussed 
with ___ who recommended transfer to ___. Held 
Lisinopril, HCTZ, Metformin and Glyburide.  Endocrine and 
Neurology saw patient. Held off on CT scan torso and 
bisphosphonates pending further improvement in Cr. 

Per patient, wife, and daughter, his speech and attention have 
been better following IV fluids and correction of hypercalcemia.

Other than arm pain, he has also had intermittent low back pain 
if he leans forward in a chair for a long period of time.

He also tells me of a Supranasal visual field defect, which has 
been followed with routine exams by a Neuro-Ophtho at Mass Eye 
and Ear.  It had not been appreciably changing until his last 
examination there, in which it was found to be possibly slightly 
worse.  The etiology was thought to be possibly Glaucoma but 
unclear.

arm pain, a fall, and weakness, found to have hypercalcemia, 
renal mass, and multiple sites of metastatic malignancy 
including the brain, all likely due to suspected new dx of RCC.

ACTIVE ISSUES
=============
# Hypercalcemia:  Most likely hypercalcemia of malignancy.  Low 
PTH and low Phos points to likelihood of PTHrP-driven process, 
esp given likely renal cell carcinoma. PTHrP ultimately came 
back as elevated in OSH records. He received IVF, Calcitonin, 
and Bisphosphonate at OSH. IVF was continued at ___, and his 
calcium downtrended.  Of note, with this improvement in serum Ca 
came an improvement in mental status.  Endocrine was consulted.  
The day prior to discharge, IVF was stopped. His follow up 
calcium the next morning was stable, and thus he was discharged 
home. PCP was aware and placed a standing order for outpatient 
electrolyte monitoring.  Home thiazide was stopped. PTHrP, 
1,25-vitamin D pending on discharge.

# Metastatic Malignancy, suspected RCC: Workup to this point is 
notable for multiple sites of involvement, including brain mets, 
humeral lytic lesion, pulmonary nodules, soft tissue nodule at 
base of right neck, possible adrenal and hepatic nodules.  Renal 
Cell Carcinoma is the most likely site of involvement given 
complete clinical picture, and elevated PTHrP is often 
associated with this.  Does have a FHx colon cancer, but is UTD 
on screening for this (last ___ ___ with rec'd ___ year f/u). 
PSA wnl also. He received Biopsy of neck soft tissue met with ___ 
on ___. General Onc, Neuro Onc, NSGY, and Rad Onc were all 
consulted/ Pt to be discussed at tumor board on ___.  
Oncology will contact him for follow-up plan on finalization of 
the pathology.  Tylenol, Oxycodone were used PRN for pain.  
Started Keppra 500mg BID for seizure ppx.  Also started Decadron 
4mg BID, later transitioned to 4mg once daily on discharge.  
Held home ASA for now in case intervention is pursued as 
outpatient (was taking for primary prevention). ___ and OT were 
consulted, recommending rolling walker and outpatient ___. SPEP 
and UPEP negative.  Urine cytology negative for high grade 
malignant cells.

# Anemia: Likely a combination of dilutional from IVF as well as 
anemia of chronic disease. No evidence of hemodynamically 
unstable bleeding, though did have hematuria on ___. Iron 
studies w/o deficiency.  Hemolysis labs unrevealing.

# Hematuria: Noted on ___ by nursing. Could be related to 
malignancy in kidney, vs less likely UTI as no infectious 
symptoms.  UA showed RBC's.  Culture negative.

# ___ on CKD: Cr 2.19 on arrival to OSH, improved with IVF, 1.4 
on discharge (although 1.2 day prior to discharge). Likely was 
pre-renal in setting of volume depletion from 
hypercalcemia-induced polyuria. Held nephrotoxins.  PCP placed 
standing order for electrolyte recheck.

# Elevated uric acid: 9.8 at OSH, 6.6>6.3 here.

# Low vitamin D: deferred on repletion for now given 
hypercalcemia

CHRONIC ISSUES
===============
# DM: Last A1C 7.0%.  ISS used in house.  Held home metformin, 
and resumed glyburide on discharge

# HTN: held home meds (Lisinopril, HCTZ), given ___ and 
hypercalcemia

# HLD: c/h atorvastatin

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES
===================
- Recheck Chem 10 (specifically for Ca, Phos, BUN/Cr) on ___ 
to ensure it is stable at home. His PCP has placed ___ standing 
order for this.
- Instructed to increase glyburide if blood sugar increased 
above 150 consistently. 
- Biopsy results pending at discharge. Unable to make Oncology 
appointment prior to tissue diagnosis. He will be contacted when 
results return, and Onc follow up will be arranged
- He will be discussed at ___ tumor board on ___
- Neuro-Oncology was e-mailed to schedule follow-up. 
- Pending labs on discharge: Vitamin D, PTHrP
- ___ recommends home ___ as well as a rolling walker
- Started on Keppra 500mg BID for seizure prophylaxis
- Started on Decahedron 4mg daily (initially started as BID) 
given brain metastasis
- Stopped Lisinopril/HCTZ combo pill given hypercalcemia and ___
- Stopped Aspirin for now in case intervention pursued on brain 
metastasis
- Found a 19 x 14 mm thyroid nodule. Ultrasound may be performed 
on a nonemergent basis to further assess.

History of Present Illness:
___ year old male, with metastatic renal cell carcinoma, diabetes 
and  hypercalcemia, who has a chief complaint of weakness. He 
also has a metastasis in his right humerus that requires 
internal fixation and  radiation. 

He saw Dr. ___ and was evaluated for Hypercalcemia , he

Pertinent Results:
OTHER DATA: 
# CXR (___): PA and lateral views the chest provided 
demonstrate no focal consolidation, large effusion or 
pneumothorax.  Please note evaluation is somewhat limited due to 
low lung volumes.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette appears normal.  
Partially visualized lucent lesion in the right midshaft humerus 
is better assessed on same-day a right humerus radiograph.  
Otherwise the bony structures appear unremarkable. 

# R humerus X-ray (___): A known 4.0 x 2.2 cm lucent lesion 
involving the right humeral midshaft appears similar to the 
prior exam without evidence of pathological fracture.  No 
additional lesions are seen within the imaged field. 

# R UE Embolization (___): 1. Hypervascular lesion involving the 
right humeral midshaft with parasitized vasculature supplied 
with multiple tumor branches arising from the brachial artery, 
profunda brachii and anterior humeral circumflex artery. 2. 
Successful embolization of 5 tumor branches with approximate 
reduction of 
90% blood flow to the right humeral lesion.  Final embolization 
right axillary arteriogram demonstrated minimal vascular flow by 
a few tiny tumoral branches arising from the distal brachial 
artery. 3. Right axillary arteriogram demonstrated an early 
bifurcating radial artery arising from the axillary artery. 4. 
Normal right common femoral arterial anatomy with mid femoral 
head access.  Successful Angio-Seal closure of right common 
femoral arteriotomy.  Palpable distal right lower extremity 
pulses. 5. Palpable right radial and ulnar pulse is throughout 
the exam.  No evidence of vascular disturbance to the hand. 

# Fixation of right humerus pathologic fracture with 
intramedullary nail (___)

# Completion of WBRT (___)
# Radiation Mapping R humerus (___)
. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
ASSESSMENT & PLAN: ___ with metastatic renal cell carcinoma 
admitted to Oncology for hyperglycemia, hypercalcemia, and 
possible internal fixation of his R humerus(lytic lesion)

#R humeral lytic lesion:  Mr. ___ was admitted with a 
large R humeral lytic mass with concerns for pathological 
fracture.   This area was painful and fragile with risk of true 
fracture with mobility.  The arm was placed in a sling for 
stabilization and the pain was treated with oral oxycodone PRN.

To address the humeral mass - a 2-part procedure was performed.  
First, he underwent ___ embolization of the R humerus 
___ to help eliminate risk of bleeding from the 
subsequent fixation procedure.  He tolerated this procedure well 
without complications and the ___ procedure was able to eliminate 
up to 90% of blood supply to tumor via embolization.  

On ___, he underwent fixation of pathological fracture, with an 
intramedullary nail.  He tolerated this procedure without 
complications.  Apparently, intraoperatively, due to the fragile 
nature of the bone, the bone had indeed fractured with minimal 
manipulation.  This was addressed by the intramedullary nail.

The RUE is now WBAT.   To address the pain and the mass itself, 
he was initiated on XRT to the humerus (beginning ___.  He 
will continue with ___ to strengthen the arm and his overall 
strength and function.  As noted, pain was controlled with the 
oxycodone 5mg Q4h PRN for pain + Bowel regimen.

# Met Renal cell carcinoma: Dr. ___ has extensive 
metastasis of the renal cell cancer with involvement of the 
brain, lungs, liver, bilateral adrenal glands, R humerus, soft 
tissue neck.  This is associated with a poor prognosis with an 
estimated life expectancy in terms of weeks to months.  During 
this stay, he received WBRT to the CNS daily for a total 10 days 
(total 30 Grys).  This was completed on ___. 

Due to cognitive decline, generalized motorized slowing, there 
was concern for radiation associated cerebral edema.  As a 
result, the dexamethasone was increased from 2mg daily to 4 mg 
BID (with 10 mg bolus on ___, with some response.  This should 
be continued for 4 mg Dexamethasone BID on discharge ___ 
for 3 days, followed by 4 mg daily for 3 days, followed by 2 mg 
daily for 3 days and then tapered to none.  

The plan was for ___ to receive Pazopanib by medonc as outpt 
(likely 2 weeks after discharge).  Because this medicine cause 
fatigue, he has be strong enough first prior to initiating this 
immunotherapy agent.  This will have to be discussed as an 
outpatient given he has transitioned to home hospice now. 

The family expressed a strong desire for second opinion at ___. 
After extensive efforts and discussions, it was determined that 
this could not be obtained while he was an inpatient.  This, 
however, can be done as an outpatient.
   He was continued on Keppra for seizure prophylaxis.

# Hypercalcemia: He presented with elevated Ca levels.  Ionized 
Ca 1.42, Ca (11.3, alb 3.2) - symptomatic with mild cognitive 
deficits.  This was attributed to malignancy (rPTH elevated at 
52 ___.  VitD level was nl.  He received IV zometa 4mg in 
the recent past (___).  He was given IVF during NPO and 
occasionally given Lasix to help manage the calcium level.  It 
remained elevated, but not significantly high enough to warrant 
continued Lasix treatment. 
   
# DM2: ___ had episodes of hyperglycemia, exacerbated by 
increased dose of dexamethasone. Weight 77kg.  The home 
glyburide and metformin were stopped.  ___ was consulted and 
assisted with insulin control with use of lantus, NPH and 
increased sliding scale.  The dexamethasone will be tapered on 
discharge and his fingersticks and insulin dosing requirements 
will need to be monitored while his dexamethasone is being 
tapered.
    
# Hx Lown Ganong ___ sx:  EP reviewed EKG, PR not especially 
short and may not meet criteria for syndrome.  There were no 
contraindications for procedures - and he tolerated the surgery 
and ___ procedure without complications. 

# FEN: Regular
# PPX: Heparin SC
# ACCESS: PIV  
# CODE: DNR/DNI  
# COMMUNICATION: Spouse ___, ___
# DISPO: ___ determined that he would benefit from acute 
rehab.  

Patient was discharged to home hospice after prior discussions 
with his wife regarding his follow-up course. His follow-up 
appointments will have to be determined after discussion with 
his wife and patient regarding follow-up needed while at home 
hospice.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear ___,
It was a pleasure looking after you.  As you know, you were 
hospitalized for evaluation of high calcium and potassium levels 
that were treated with IV hydration.   

You also had lytic humerus bone mass which was large enough to 
cause risk of fracture.  For this reason, you were initially
