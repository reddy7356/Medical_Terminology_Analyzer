motility disorder s/p ileostomy, h/o adrenal insufficiency, 
Peripheral/sensory neuropathy, who presents from home after 
extensive liposuction surgery on ___, with chief complaint of 
bilateral leg pain, abdominal pain, and bladder spasm. 

During this hospitalization we tried to address her chronic 
abdominal symptoms, though ultimately shifted therapeutic 
regimen back to what she was on pre-admission. Her leg 
weakness/neuropath seems to be an acute worsening of her 
underlying neuropathic syndrome and likely worsened in setting 
of surgery and UTI / Pyelo.  She completed antibiotics with 
resolution of urinary symptoms. She started to work with our ___ 
/ OT, and will need Significant further help... We tried to 
ensure her medication list from ___ matched what we used to 
ensure her GI regimen was similar. By day of discharge she was 
tolerating small bites of egg whites.

of parastomal mesh, recent admission to ___ for reported C. 
diff colitis and ?adrenal insufficiency, who presented with 
severe abdominal pain.

# Abdominal Pain/GI motility Disorder:
Likely neuropathic. Initialy ddx included pain related to known 
dysmotility d/o, post-surgical pain, mesh-related inflammation 
(less likely) and, even less likely, adrenal insufficiency 
(questionable dx and already on hydrocortisone) vs. pain related 
L5 radiculopathy. Per OSH records, pt recently had admission for 
pain (DC ___ at ___ and required PCA, which was later felt 
to not be medically indicated. No clear etiology for pain was 
discovered at that time. During this admission colorectal 
surgery consulted and pt met with Dr. ___. Stool studies were

given abnormality noted at ___ on prior admission and were 
within normal limits. The patent also underwent an EGD as she 
had the sensation of food getting stuck. The EGD was normal, 
although there was some bile in the stomach consistent with the 
patient's known dismotility. The consulting services felt no 
further inpatient work up was indicated. The patent was then 
transitioned off IV pain medication, IV fluids and diet was 
advanced. The patient was discharged on oral oxycodone liquid 
which she had been on previously. She was also started on 
tizanidine. She was continued on her gabapentin. Her doses of 
amitrpytiline and duloxetine were increased.  he was able to 
tolerate a regular diet (lactose free, gluten free, low FODMAP).

was sent and had RBCs and WBCs. Culture was positive for 
pan-sensitive E. Coli and she was treated with a 7day course of 
Bactrim. 

# Adrenal Insufficiency:
Per OSH record, pt was diagnosed with adrenal insufficiency 
based on hypoglycemia, abd pain and borderline ___ stim test. 
Hydrocortisone was continued. The patient will need endocrine 
follow up. 

# Liver hypodensity:
Noted incidentally on CT scan and previously evaluated at ___ 
(see note from ___ in OMR) with MRI. Found to have lesion of 
unclear significance possibly related to hypoperfusion. Per Dr. 
___ not instrumented during recent surgery. Abdominal 
US did not show e/o hypo perfusion. Recommend outpatient 
follow-up of liver lesion
