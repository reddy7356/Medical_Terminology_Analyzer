RUQ u/s: 
1. Dilated CBD (13mm) with mild intrahepatic biliary duct 
dilation. No definite obstructing mass or stone is seen in the 
CBD which appears to terminate abruptly in the pancreatic head. 
ERCP or MRCP may be obtained for further evaluation. 
2. Echogenic liver consistent with steatosis. Other forms of 
liver disease including hepatic fibrosis or cirrhosis or 
steatohepatitis cannot be excluded on the basis of this 
examination. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ year old M with no significant medical history who presents 
with RUQ pain. 

# Biliary obstruction without cholangitis - went to ercp:

 Scout film was normal. 
Limited pancreatogram was normal 
The bile duct was deeply cannulated with the sphincterotome. 
There was a tapering of the distal CBD at the level of the 
ampulla. 
The CBD was dilated to 9-10mm in diameter. No filling defects 
were identified. 
The left and right hepatic ducts mildly dilated. 
A biliary sphincterotomy was made with a sphincterotome. There 
was no post-sphincterotomy bleeding. 
The biliary tree was swept with a 9-12mm balloon starting at the 
bifurcation without removal of stone or sludge. 
Brushings of the distal CBD were obtained for cytology. 
A ___ x 7cm plastic CBD stent was placed to ensure adequate 
biliary drainage. 
Excellent bile and contrast drainage was seen endoscopically and 
fluoroscopically.  
These findings could be consistent with a passed stone but 
subtle distal CBD stricture cannot be excluded 
Otherwise normal ercp to third part of the duodenum

LR at 200 cc/hr
