History of Present Illness:
___ male with h/o vasculitis, lupus-like syndrome, currently 
getting chemotherapy for renal involvement and noted that a few 
days after his third chemo treatment he started having daily 
coughing fits and coughing up "a shot glass full" of bright red

CT CHest ___: IMPRESSION: 
1. Given the patient's history of vasculitis, new development of 
cavitary 
left upper lobe lesions, in combination with numerous scattered 
ground-glass opacities is most consistent with this diagnosis. 
However infectious etiology cannot be excluded. 
2. Small bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than left. 
3. No pulmonary embolism. 
4. Splenic, pulmonary, calcifications with pretracheal calcified 
adenopathy is consistent with prior granulomatous disease such 
as Histoplasmosis or Tuberculosis. 

CXR ___:
IMPRESSION:  
1. Progressive peripheral consolidation, both lungs; diagnostic 
considerations include chronic eosinoophilic and cryptogenic 
organizing 
pneumonia and pulmonary lymphoma.  
2. Cavitating nodule in the left lung apex could be due to 
tuberculosis, or fungal infection.  
3. Alternatively, all pulmonary findings could be due to 
necrotizing 
vasculitis, but first priority is to evaluate possible acute 
infection 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
Pt presented to the ED at the request of his nephrologist, Dr. 
___ he reported 5 days of hemoptysis.  He was found to 
have a left apical cavitary lesion seen on CXR and confirmed on 
CT and admitted to rule out TB

# Hemoptysis: Pt presented to the floor afebrile, with no 
elevated WBC count and new findings on CXR and CT scan 
suggestive of infection vs. necrotizing vasculitis.  He was 
placed on respiratory isolation and started on Zosyn and 
azithromycin to cover for community acquired PNA.  Rheum, Renal 
and Pulm were consulted.  Sputum was collected x3 via induction 
and x1 via bronchoalveolar lavage performed by pulmonology.  
Induced sputum was negative for AFB and BAL sputum was negative 
for AFB, nothing grown on gram stain, and no fungi seen on ___ 
prep.  Abx were discontinued and pt taken off respiratory 
isolation.  Given his immunosuppressed state, it was still not 
clear whether it could be definitively said whether he did or 
did not have an infection.  ID was involved and requested we 
send for tests to look for nocardia, histo, coccidiomycosis, 
aspergillosis, and more sensitive tests for TB.  Pt stabilized 
over the hospital course and was not havin episodes of 
hemoptysis at time of discharge.  He will f/u with outpt 
providers.  He was instructed to increase his prednisone dose to 
60mg on ___ if he remained asymptomatic.

# Vasculitis/lupus like syndrome:  As stated above, the etiology 
of the hemoptysis was unclear.  Patient's daily Prednisone at 
40mg was continued throughout the hospital course.  His cough 
and hemoptysis improved and at the time of discharge he was no 
longer coughing up blood.  His other comorbidities related to 
his vasculitis were stable throughout the course of his hospital 
stay.  His bactrim for infectious prophylaxis was also continued 
throughout the course of his hospital stay.

# Lower extremity edema:  The patient presented with b/l lower 
extremity edema secondary to prednisone use.  He was being 
treated with lasix and this was continued.  His edema did not 
resolve during his hospital stay, but remained stable and he was 
discharged on lasix.

# Lower extremity ulcers:  Pt presented with multiple lower 
extremity ulcers below the level of the knee b/l.  The ulcers at 
the time of admission looked clean, non-erythematous, clean, and 
all were non weeping except for one on the Right lower extremity 
and the lateral aspect of his shin.  Wound care was consulted 
and his ulcers were kept clean as per their recommendations.  
They remained clean and stable throughout the course of his 
hospital stay.  

The patient symptoms improved and many of his studies came back 
negative with many studies negative that will be followed up 
when he visits his physicians in the outpatient setting.  The 
patient was discharged with f/u with his PCP, ___, ID, 
Surgery, Heme/Onc and Dr. ___ will make an appointment 
with him so that he will follow up with Rheumatology as well.

Discharge Instructions:
You are being discharged from the hospital after 4 days.  You 
were initially admitted after you came to the Emergency 
department reporting coughing up blood and you were found to 
have a cavitary lesion in the apex of your left lung on imaging. 
 You were put on respiratory isolation until we ruled out that 
you had TB.  You were also started on antibiotics Zosyn and 
azithromycin until we could prove you did not have a PNA.  After 
three sputum samples and a bronchoalveolar lavage we did not 
find any evidence of infection and you were taken off 
respiratory isolation.  However, since you are immunosuppressed 
from all your medications we were worried that there may still 
be a chance that the blood and findings on imaging were still 
related to an infectious process.  ID came and saw you and we 
sent out labs to ensure that there is no infectious process 
causing the cavitary lesion and that it is more related to your 
underlying vasculitis.  we also placed a PPD that you must go to 
your PCP office ot have read on ___.  Also we are going to 
increase your steroids to 60mg and will have you follow up with 
your outside physicians.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ is a ___ year old gentleman with a PMH significant 
for an autoimmune syndrome/vasculitis, CIDP, bilateraly hip AVN, 
and renal failure now admitted for LLE rash

1. Rash: Presented with fever and petechial rash on left lower 
extremity thought to be secondary to cellulitis.  Although 
vasculitis was in the differential, this was thought to be less 
likely as rash was asymmetric and patient was on high dose 
immunosuppressants.  The rash was atypical for a 
hypersensitivity reaction and though patient had just initiated 
bactrim for PCP prophylaxis, this was thought to be an unlikely 
cause.  Ultrasound was negative for DVT.   Patient was initially 
maintained on unasyn/ vancomycin which was switched to keflex at 
time of discharge.  Patient instructed to complete a 10 day 
course of antibiotics and follow up closely with PCP.

2. Lower extremity ulcerations: Presented with nonhealing 
ulcerations on bilateral lower extremities, differential 
diagnosis includes pyogenic gangrenosum from medium vessel 
vasculitis, cryoglobulinemia, or
thrombophilic state.  Although wounds were poorly healing in 
setting of high dose steroid use, there was also concern for  
secondary infection.  Dermatology was consulted and performed a 
punch biopsy.  At the time of discharge, tissue had grown scarce 
yeast (thought to be normal skin contaminant) with wound culture 
pending.  Labs to evaluate for thrombophilia were also pending 
at time of discharge and should be followed up as an outpatient. 
 

3. Lupus Nephritis:Renal biopsy on ___ consistent with 
membranous lupus nephritis and patient initated treatment with 
cytoxan and high dose prednisone.   Renal function has 
subsequently stabilized/ minally improved.  Patient maintained 
on current dose of prednisone with bactrim for PCP ___.  
 He will follow up with his nephrologist as an outpatient for 
further management.

Brief Hospital Course:
___ yo M with history of vasculitis including prior pulmonary 
hemorrhage and lupus nephritis being treated with prednisone and 
cytoxan who presented to ___ on ___ with hypoxic 
respiratory failure and shock.
.
# Hypoxic Respiratory failure: The differential diagnosis for 
acute respiratory failure in this significantly 
immunocompromised patient included bacterial infection, 
fungal/PCP infection, pulmonary hemorrhage, cytoxan-induced 
pneumonitis.  ID, Rheum, and Nephrology were consulted.  The 
patient was intubated and had an esophageal balloon for 
transplerual pressure monitoring placed.  Rheum thought that a 
vasculitic process was unlikely given that the patient was on 
cytoxan and prednisone as an outpatient and there was no benefit 
from plasmapheresis.  He was treated with pulse steroids for 4 
days, then tapered back to a standing dose of prednisone, which 
was later discontinued.  Renal initiated CVVH given the 
patient's ___ and tenuous clinical picture, and this was later 
discontinued as his renal function improved.  Per ID, the 
patient was initially started on vancomycin, meropenem, IV 
bactrim, ambisome, and ciprofloxacin.  Cultures and studies to 
look for CMV, crypto, PCP, ___, and fungi were sent.  A 
sputum culture grew back yeast and mold - later identified as 
zygomycetes/cunninghamella and aspergillus.
.
# Stroke:  As Mr. ___ was weaned from sedation, it was 
noted that his mental status did not improve as expected.  Head 
CT showed a large right MCA and PCA stroke, which was later 
better characterized with MRI.  Stroke team was consulted and 
provided prognostic information to the family regarding the 
deficits Mr. ___ could expect if he recovered from his 
acute illness.  On ___, he was noted to have a blown pupil, 
and repeat head CT showed hemorrhagic conversion of the stroke 
with uncal and subfalcine herniation.
.
# Tachycardia/Hypertension - This was thought to be in part from 
benzo withdrawal and also from heart failure.  An echo obtained 
on admission showed an EF of ___ with moderate to severe MR.  
___ patient was diuresed with CVVH as above with improvement in 
his hypoxia.  However, he remained tachycardic and hypertensive. 
 His benzo withdrawal was treated as above, and he was given 
some fluid back.  
.
# Hct drop: Most concerning for pulmonary hemorrhage in setting 
of known vasculatis with significant lung lesion.  No indication 
of GI bleed or other source of blood loss, although dilution 
could certainly  be contributing to decreased counts.  
Stabilized.
.
# Acute on chronic renal failure - The patient's creatinine on 
admission was 2.5, up from a baseline of 1.0.  He was started on 
CVVH, which was stopped after 4 days.  His urine output 
significantly improved after he was stabilized.  
.
# Goals of care:  Multiple family meetings were held with the 
family and with the primary MICU team as well as consultants 
from ID, Rheum, and Stroke.  The family was clear that Mr. 
___ would not have wanted invasive measures to prolong his 
life without meaningful hope of recovery, and decided to move to 
DNR/CMO.  He was terminally extubated on ___, and passed 
away shortly thereafter in the presence of his family.  His son, 
the next of kin, was notified, and requested an autopsy.
