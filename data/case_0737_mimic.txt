Her nasogastric tube was removed after 24 hours and she 
eventually tolerated liquids without difficulty.  Her diet was 
advanced to regular and she tolerated it well without nausea or 
vomiting.  She was treated for a UTI with 3 days of Cipro based 
on a urine culture from ___.  Her urine culture here 
grew 10K-100K GNR's.  She had no dysuria or hematuria and was 
voiding in sufficient amounts. 

Her blood pressure was elevated at 180/90 on a routine check 
after ranging 140-160/80.  After checking with her PCP and

that was resumed and her blood pressure was more controlled.
