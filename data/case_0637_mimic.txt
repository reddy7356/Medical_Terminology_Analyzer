Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ is a ___ y/o female w/ a hx of opioid use disorder 
c/b multiple overdoses, depression, and anxiety who p/w AMS iso 
fentanyl overdose. She was initially intubated in the ED and 
admitted to the MICU, where she was extubated within 12 hours. 
Within a few hours of ICU transfer, she requested to leave AMA. 
Risks/benefits were reviewed and understood prior to discharge. 

#Polysubstance Use Disorder (opioids, methamphetamines)
#Opioid Overdose
Presented with altered mental status following unintentional 
fentanyl overdose. She was given narcan several times prior to 
arrival. Given AMS, she was intubated in the ED and admitted to 
the MICU. Within a few hours, sedation was weaned and she was 
successfully extubated to room air. She described ongoing mild 
withdrawal symptoms that did not require treatment. She denied 
any intentional overdose nor recent SI/HI. She remained 
pre-contemplative, reporting that she was not interested in 
stopping substance use at this time but was interested in using 
"as safely as possible." Patient had previously been on 
suboxone, able to maintain abstinence from opioids for ___ year; 
not interested in resuming at this time. Had planned for SW and 
addiction psychiatry evaluation, but patient declined and left 
against medical advice overnight after transfer from MICU. 
Patient given a script of narcan at time of discharge. 

#Depression
#Anxiety
#Bipolar Disorder
Following extubation, the patient did not exhibit signs of 
mania, psychosis, or significant depression. She denied any 
current or recent SI/HI. She had previously been on psychiatric 
medications but stopped ___ year ago, not currently interested in 
restarting. Psychiatry evaluation was deferred as the patient 
lacked acute symptoms, concern for intentional overdose was low, 
and the patient exhibited capacity to leave AMA. 

#Left AMA
Shortly after transfer from the MICU, the patient requested to 
leave AMA. Multiple discussions occurred with the patient, 
specifically noting the significant risk for harm, including 
death. Ms. ___ was able to review and verbalize the 
risks/benefits of leaving and had capacity to make this 
decision. Events were discussed with the overnight hospitalist 
who agreed that she had the right to leave AMA. She does not 
currently have a PCP and is limited to specific providers due to 
her insurance. Unable to schedule PCP follow up prior to 
discharge. Patient said she would follow up with a PCP in the 
coming week. 

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
=====================
[ ] Patient left AMA despite extensive discussion against this 
decision
[ ] Unable to schedule PCP follow up prior to discharge
[ ] Will need ongoing discussion regarding harm reduction of IV 
opioid use, as well as options for MAT. 
[ ] Consider screening for HIV, Hepatitis as an outpatient 
[ ] Consider starting medical therapy for depression, anxiety if 
patient willing

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,

You were admitted to the ICU at ___ because of an opioid 
overdose requiring a breathing tube to be placed in the 
Emergency Department.

We were able to remove the breathing tube and you were otherwise 
doing well.

We talked about your opioid use and it is clear that it is 
causing significant problems as you have had multiple overdoses 
in the past year. You stated you are not yet ready to quit, so 
we talked about harm reduction strategies:
- Always use clean needles! It sounds like you are well 
connected to the needle exchange, which is great.
- Continue using clean cotton and sources of clean water.
- Always carry Narcan with you.
- Never use alone, so in case of overdose, they are able to give 
Narcan and get you help.

If you have any thoughts of suicide, know that you have 
resources:
- Suicide Hotline ___
- You can also come in to any ED at any time and we will be able 
to get you the help you need.

Sincerely,

Your ___ Team
