                            **FINAL REPORT ___

   C. difficile PCR (Final ___: 
      NEGATIVE. 
           (Reference Range-Negative). 
      The C. difficile PCR is highly sensitive for toxigenic 
strains of C.
      difficile and detects both C. difficile infection (CDI) 
and
      asymptomatic carriage. 
      A negative C. diff PCR test indicates a low likelihood of 
CDI or
      carriage.

cm nodular
opacity projecting over the left lower chest/lung.
