No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality

___
Conclusions   
Pre-CPB:
 The left atrium is normal in size. No atrial septal defect is 
seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is moderate symmetric left 
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is 
moderately dilated. Overall left ventricular systolic function 
is moderately depressed (LVEF= 35-40 %). The calculated cardiac 
output by continuity equation is 6.4L/min. Right ventricular 
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. 

 The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The descending thoracic 
aorta is mildly dilated. There are simple atheroma in the 
descending thoracic aorta. No thoracic aortic dissection is 
seen. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal 
with good leaflet excursion. No aortic regurgitation is seen. 

 The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial mitral 
regurgitation is seen. 

 Dr. ___ was notified in person of the results at time of study. 


 Post-CPB:
 Biventricular systolic function is preserved. The estimated 
LVEF is 40%. The calculated cardiac output is L/min. 

 The MR remains trace. Other valvular function remains 
unchanged. There is no evidence of aortic dissection.    
   I certify that I was present for this procedure in compliance 
with ___ regulations.

Brief Hospital Course:
___ with a h/o HTN and DM who presents with diarrheal illness, 
syncope, and ___, found to have multivessel coronary disease.

#HFrEF
#Multivessel CAD
EKG obtained in the setting of syncope showed new ST depressions 
and T wave changes. His TTE showed an EF of 40%.  He therefore 
underwent LHC via right radial showing multivessel disease. 
Troponins were serially negative at ___.  He was 
transferred to ___ and underwent CABG on ___.  He was treated 
with aspirin, atorvastatin, Metoprolol.

#Syncope:  Patient presented with syncope in the setting of 
acute diarrheal illness with dehydration and acute renal 
failure.  Apparently seizure like activity was noted, but EEG, 
MRI, and CT head were unremarkable at OSH.

#Acute diarrheal illness:  Symptoms improved, and he had no 
leukocytosis, fever, or systemic toxicity.  C-diff and stool 
studies negative at OSH.  Likely traveler's diarrhea given 
recent trip to ___.

#Acute renal failure on CKD: This resolved with IVF at the OSH.  
Stable on admission to ___.

#Diabetes: A1C 9.3%, did insulin sliding scale.

#Gout: Continue home allopurinol
.
CARDIAC SURGERY COURSE ___
The patient was brought to the Operating Room on ___ where 
the patient underwent CABG x 3 ___.  Overall the 
patient tolerated the procedure well and post-operatively was 
transferred to the CVICU in stable condition for recovery and 
invasive monitoring.  
 POD 1 found the patient extubated, alert and oriented and 
breathing comfortably.  The patient was neurologically intact 
and hemodynamically stable.  Beta blocker was initiated and the 
patient was gently diuresed toward the preoperative weight.  The 
patient was transferred to the telemetry floor for further 
recovery.  Chest tubes and pacing wires were discontinued 
without complication.  Metformin resumed as well as Lantus with 
sliding scale for glucose management.  The patient was evaluated 
by the Physical Therapy service for assistance with strength and 
mobility.  By the time of discharge on POD 5 the patient was 
ambulating freely, the wound was healing and pain was controlled 
with oral analgesics.  The patient was discharged ___ 
___ in good condition with appropriate follow up 
instructions.
