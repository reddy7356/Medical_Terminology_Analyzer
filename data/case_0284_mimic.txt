Attending: ___.
 
Chief Complaint:
Hyperkalemia
 
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Hemodialysis
 
History of Present Illness:
Ms. ___ is a ___ woman with a history of DMII, COPD on 
home O2, OSA on bipap, HTN, ESRD on HD (___) via RUE 
brachiobrachial AVG (___) who presents with clotted AVG s/p 
failed thrombectomy. Found to be hyperkalemic.  
Patient has a RUE AVG placed ___. She had recurrent 
problems with outflow stenosis and difficulty with cannulation 
due to the course of the graft. On ___ she underwent 
revision with a jump graft and then another revision with patch 
angioplasty of the venous anastomosis on ___. Over the 
past two weeks, patient has had difficulty at graft site 
including pain and swelling during HD treatments, but graft has 
been functioning. Today, HD could not be completed and she was 
sent to the ___ due to concern for clot, where an 
ultrasound showed a thrombus extending from the graft proximally 
to the sublcavian vein (imaging not yet available in our 
system). This was felt to be indicative of a central stenosis 
that would not be amenable to an open thrombectomy. An ___ 
thrombectomy was attempted and 4 mg TPA was instilled without 
success. Because of use of TPA, ___ was not comfortable placing 
another HD line. Of note, she does have a left forearm fistula 
with a thrill placed in ___ at an OSH, which was never used 
because it was too deep. She was sent to the ER for further 
eval.  
In the ED, initial vitals were 98.3 64 138/53 18 97% RA. Initial 
labs were notable for hyperkalemia to 6.4 and thrombocytopenia 
(54). Patient received kayexalate, calcium gluconate, and 
insulin. Renal was consulted and will see patient in the morning 
but preliminarily recommended kayexalate and NPO at ___. She was 
seen by ___, who recommended 6 months of anticoagulation for her 
RUE DVT. Of note, she has a heparin allergy which limits 
anticoagulation options. She was admitted to the MICU for 
further care.  
On arrival to the MICU, patient confirms the above history. She 
has not noted SOB above her baseline or palpitations. She 
endorses pain and swelling over the graft site.  
In terms of her thrombocytopenia, patient reports it was 
diagnosed ___ years ago. Platelets nadired in the low 30's. She 
was seen at ___, where she was told she should not take 
heparin again in case thrombocytopenia is related to heparin. 
She was not formally diagnosed with HIT. She received N-plate 
but has not taken it recently. Baseline plt is 100, most 
recently ~106. She has had no recent mucosal bleeding, blood in 
stool, or hematuria.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ is a ___ woman with a history of DM II (on 
insulin), COPD (on ___ home O2), OSA, and ESRD on HD (___) 
who presented from HD with a clotted RUE AVG and hyperkalemia 
and thrombocytopenia. 

# Hyperkalemia: Likely ___ to ESRD and missing HD session on 
___. Per patient, K occasionally runs in low 6's prior to HD 
sessions. She was unable to be dialyzed ___ due to graft 
dysfunction from clot. Reportedly had peaked Ts on EKG in ED, 
received kayexalate and calcium gluconate. EKG on arrival to the 
MICU did not show hyperkalemic changes. No arrhythmias on 
telemetry. Kayexelate was continued and her potassium 
downtrended to 5.2 by HD 1. Pt's HD line appeared to be 
functioning well (see below), and pt was dialyzed. Post-HD 
potassium was within normal limits.  

# RUE DVT: Extends to right subclavian. ___ recommended 6 months 
of anticoagulation. but patient has a heparin allergy, limiting 
anticoagulation options. Because of tenuous IV access (#20 PIV R 
hand) and thrombocytopenia, the risk of starting a 
non-reversible anticoagulant such as argatroban was judged to 
outweigh the benefit, esp given that pt was scheduled for 
temporary HD line placement by ___ the next day. Patient did not 
require a procedure as her RUE DVT was no longer present after 
repeat RUE ultrasound did not show a clot. Pt started warfarin 
however it was discontinued prior to her discharge given that 
transplant surgery was planning a procedure on ___ (see 
below). 

# Thrombocytopenia: Etiology unclear. Recent baseline 100. 
History is not convincing for HIT, though OSH hematology records 
were not available to confirm. ITP also possible. Trended 
platelets w/ plan to transfuse if fell <10 or if actively 
bleeding which did not occur.

# ESRD: On HD ___. After clot prevented completion of HD on 
___, flow in HD line reportedly could not be restored after an 
attempted ___ thrombectomy and TPA instillation. Could not 
receive heparin ___ reported allergy. In the MICU, pt was 
continued on her home furosemide, sevelamer and nephrocaps. 
Initially RUE AVG was non-functional, and ___ HD line 
placement was planned. However, trial of accessing HD line was 
successful, possibly delayed effect of TPA infusion, and pt was 
dialyzed on ___. Post-HD potassium was wnl, and pt was 
transferred to the floor in stable condition. Pt underwent US of 
her L forearm fistula to evaluate for possibility of 
superficializing, which showed patent AVF. Patient had a patent 
RUE and LUE fistula.  She is scheduled to have a 
superficialization procedure by transplant surgery on ___, 
at which time she will likely restart warfarin.

# DM II. Continued insulin pump.  

# COPD. Continued O2 by NC @ 3L during day, 4L at night 
(baseline), continue Symbicort, albuterol. 

# OSA: per patient, had sleep study which showed resolution of 
OSA, not on CPAP
 
# Hypercholesterolemia. Continued simvastatin.  

# HTN. Continued amlodipine, doxazosin.  

# pHTN. Stable.   

# GERD. Continued omeprazole. 
 
# Tremor: Patient confirmed she has no seizure history; Keppra 
is for tremor only. Continued Keppra.  

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
-Patient is to receive surgery on ___ from transplant for 
LUE fistula
-Patient should restart warfarin after procedure to prevent 
clots

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,

You were admitted to ___ after your dialysis fistula clotted.  
While you were here, your fistula was re-evaluated and you had 
tPA and a thrombectomy of that fistula.  An ultrasound later 
showed the fistula to be working well.  You also had an 
ultrasound of your left fistula (which you haven't been using) 
and can follow up with the transplant surgeon regarding that 
fistula.  We started you on warfarin (coumadin) to help prevent 
clots in that fistula.  We stopped this so you could potentially 
have surgery ___ for your Left fistula.

Please follow up with your primary care doctor, your 
nephrologist, and transplant surgery.  The transplant surgeons 
would like to see you later this week, likely on ___, to 
potentially superficialize your left upper extremity fisutla or 
place a new fistula if necessary. It was a pleasure taking care 
of you.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ is a ___ year old woman with a past medical history 
significant for end stage renal disease on hemodialysis, type 2 
diabetes mellitus and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease 
admitted for fevers x1 month, which were ultimately felt to be 
drug fever from either Vancomycin or minoxidil. Hospital course 
was notable for a mild COPD exacerbation and steroid induced 
hyperglycemia

#Fever of unknown origin/Drug Fever: Given history of bacteremia 
with strep mitis and preceding 1 month of persistent fevers with 
normal TTE and CT abdomen, initially our efforts focused on 
finding a source persistent infection. Initial culprits were 
thought to be the dialysis graft or endocarditis. Negative TTE 
at OSH, and negative TEE in house made endocarditis unlikely. 
Unremarkable US of right upper extremity graft made this 
unlikely. Furthermore, there was only a mild increase in tracer 
uptake in the right upper extremity compared to the left upper 
extremity on tagged white blood cell scan. Bilateral lower 
extremity vascular ultrasounds were negative for DVT. Blood 
smear was negative for parasites. Hepatitis serologies were also 
negative and LFTs were normal. An MRI was also obtained given 
spinal hardware and was negative for signs of 
infection/inflammation. Due to worsening shortness of breath 
discovered in house, a CT of the chest was performed which was 
significant for ground glass opacities involving the posterior 
aspect of left upper lobe, lingula and left lower lobe. BAL and 
bronchial biopsy were significant only for ___ cfu of gram 
negative rods and respiratory flora. A transbronchial biopsy was 
non-specific without evidence of malignancy or granulomas. Six 
sets of blood cultures were obtained while Ms. ___ was off of 
antibiotics. Beta Glucan and Galactomannal were within normal 
limits.Rheumatologic labwork was relatively unimpressive with a 
normal ANCA/RF and intermediate ___ (1:80). Given absence of 
positive infectious workup, Vancomycin was discontinued, as was 
minoxidil as patient gave history fevers starting around the 
time of minoxidil initiation. After stopping these medications, 
the patient defervesced and was afebrile for >5 days suggesting 
drug fever.

#Mild exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease:
Overall Ms. ___ respiratory symptoms and radiographic 
findings were seen as most consistent with a COPD exacerbation. 
Patient was treated with azithromycin and prednisone 40mg po 
with improvement in symptoms and patient was discharged to 
complete a one week total course. Of note, it took ~4 days for 
patient to start responding to the steroids, which was similar 
to when patient has required steroids for COPD exacerbation in 
the past. Although patient grew ___ cfu E. coli in the BAL it 
was not felt that these were pathogenic as patient responded to 
treatment with azithro and prednisone.    

#End stage renal disease on dialysis: MWF dialysis was continued 
in house. Due to hypophosphatemia, revela and phoslo were 
temporarily discontinued.

#Type II diabetes mellitus: Ms. ___ was maintained on her 
insulin pump which was closely monitored by the ___. 
Her blood sugars increased while on steroids (up to 400s), and 
basal parameters of her pump were increased while she was on 
steroids with input from ___.  She was discharged with close 
followup in ___ clinic two days post discharge and was 
made aware that her insulin requirements will fall once her 
steroids are completed.  She is aware of signs of hypoglycemia 
and was discharged with glucagon injectable as needed.

# BPPV: Meclizine was continued.

#Disposition:
Patient was discharged home with one more day of prednisone to 
take. She ___ with her Endocrinologist who will give her 
instructions on how to change her insulin as she comes off 
prednisone. She will also follow up with her PCP, outpatient 
renal and pulmonary doctors.
