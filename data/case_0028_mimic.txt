At 3 hours 91% of the ingested activity remains in the stomach 
At 4 hours 88% of the ingested activity remains in the stomach 
The majority of the residual tracer activity remains in the 
gastric fundus throughout the study. 
  
IMPRESSION:  
Delayed gastric emptying.  Minimal emptying during 4 hours of

esophagitis or reflux esophagitis.  
Irregular Z line noted at GE Junction (biopsy) 
Mild-moderate gastritis (biopsy) 
Mild duodenitis 
Otherwise normal EGD to third part of the duodenum

 
Brief Hospital Course:
ASSESSMENT
The patient is a ___ ESRD s/p cadaver allograft ___ ___ years, 
6months ago) on tacrolimus and prednisone, type one diabetes, 
CAD s/p CABGx4, PVD s/p right popliteal stent, chronic lower 
extremity non-healing ulcers, h/o mult DVTs on coumadin admitted 
with cervical/facial dystonia found to have acute renal failure 
and supratherapeutic INR
.
#DYSTONIC REACTION: Intermittent spasmodic involuntary 
contraction of neck, face, trunk was most consistent with 
cervical/facial dystonic reaction. The most likely cause is 
medication induced witih possible meds including zofran (<1%) or 
levofloxacin (case reports). These medications were held and he 
was given cogentin in the ED. The dystonic movements resolved 
over ___.  It is not clear exactly which of these 
medications was the cause - would avoid levofloxacin in the 
future if able. This was added to ADR list. 
.
#SUPRATHERAPEUTIC INR: Patient on chronic warfarin due to 
recurrent DVT found to have INR of 9. This is likely due to a 
combination of levoquin and possible nutritional deficiency. He 
was given vitamin K and coumadin was held with return of INR to 
goal. He was restarted on coumadin on ___. His INR was 
supratherapeutic at discharge. His dose should be held on ___ 
and then on ___ he should be started on 0.5mg daily.  Please 
perform twice weekly INR checks to make sure he stays within 
goal of ___. 
.
# ACUTE RENAL FAILURE: Patient with baseline of 1.2 admitted 
with creatinine of 2.3. He appeared dehydrated on exam and labs 
w/ FeNa 0.2 c/w prerenal etiology in setting of limited PO 
intake ___ chronic nausea. Renal ultrasound without evidence of 
obstruction and patent main vasculature. Lasix was held and he 
was given intravenous fluids with normalization of his renal 
function (at baseline of 1.2 on discharge). Lasix, at home dose, 
was restarted at discharge. Would continue to monitor fluid 
status and at least weekly chemistry. If creatinine trends up 
would consider reducing dose of lasix to 20mg daily or holding 
for several days and rechecking creatinine. 
.
#NAUSEA: He reports nausea, weight loss, and intermittent loose 
stools since ___. His abdominal exam was benign. An 
evaluation during previous admission - infectious studies (stool 
bacteria, O/P, CMV), Celiac disease (tTG IgA), CT abdomen - was 
negative. During this admission, stool study for C. difficile 
returned positive. This is his second recurrence so he was 
started on oral vancomycin.  He also had a gastric emptying 
study that showed 88 % residual tracer activity at the end of 4 
hours which is consistent with gastroparesis. The 
gastrointestinology service was consulted. The etiology of the 
nausea is likely multifactorial. First, suboptimally controlled 
diabetes (A1C 9.2 in ___ is likely contributing as he has 
evidence of other complications including retinopathy, 
peripheral neuropathy. We recommend tight control of diabetes, 
although this has been difficult due to labile blood sugars. 
Second, narcotics (oxycodone) can delay gastric emptying. We 
recommneded limiting his narcotics if possible. We also 
discussed the importance of small frequent meals with a low fat, 
low fiber diet. Pharmacological management was considered 
although he has an allergy to reglan (confusion) and 
erythromycin was not felt to be a good option in setting of 
ongoing C.difficile infection.  GI also thought that 
Botox-injection in pylorus could be considered in the future if 
these strategies do not work.  He underwent an upper endoscopy, 
that revealed findings that could be consistent with 
eosinophilic esophagitis or reflux esophagitis. There was also 
mild to moderate gastritis. Biopsies were obtained and are 
pending at discharge. He was started on omperazole 20mg BID. We 
recommended an anti-reflux regimen that includes (1)avoiding 
chocolate, peppermint, alcohol, caffeine, onions, aspirin (2) 
elevating the head of the bed 3 inches (3) go to bed with an 
empty stomach (4) avoid NSAIDS.  
If biospy is positive for H.pylori will require treatment. He 
will follow-up with gastroenterology as an outpatient. 
.
#URINARY RETENTION: Patient developed urinary retention, failing 
voiding trial twice, during his stay.  Repeat UA on ___ could be 
consistent with foley associated UTI, with urine culture pending 
at time of discharge.  He was started on tamsulosin for urine 
retention. The foley catheter was left in place at time of 
discharge. This should be REMOVED upon admission to facility for 
voiding trial. If he does not void within 8hr of removal please 
perform intermittent straight cath Q8hr until voids. If he is 
able to void the can stop straight cath and can try d/c 
tamsulosin. If patient develops dysuria or other symptoms 
concerning for UTI would give antibiotics (avoid levofloxacin) 
and f/u on urine culture drawn on ___ at ___. 
.
#CHRONIC LOWER EXTREMITY ULCER: Patient with chronic calcaneus 
ulcers bilaterally likely due to poor healing from DM1, PVD, and 
chronic steroids. Exam was not concerning for infection. Foot 
x-ray showed no evidence of osteomyelitis. Podiatry was 
consulted and recommended local wound care, off-loading, and 
elevation of lower extremities. Wound care consisted of adaptic 
(non-adherent) dressing daily, heel cup, wrap with kerlex, keep 
elevated on two pillows. 
.
#STAGE II COCCYX ULCER: Patient with stage II ulcer on 
admission. Local wound care provided with foam (mepilex) 
dressing every three days. Frequent repositioning to 
redistribute pressure. 
.
#VISUAL HALLUCINATIONS: His wife reported subacute development 
of complex visual hallucinations over the past several weeks. 
His vision appeared full on exam. 
Toxic-metabolic encephalopathy due to infectious etiology from 
C. Difficile infection may have been contributing. Medication 
side effects also considered as  levofloxacin can cause acute 
psychosis although timeframe does not correlate.   Other 
infectious work-up including blood and urine culture negative. 
Tox-screen was negative. Thyroid studies revealed subclinical 
hypothyroidism but not started on supplementation given history 
of cardiac disease. RPR negative. B12 within normal limits. In 
the absence of identifiable organic etiology, could also 
consider psychiatric conditions such as depression w/ psychotic 
features - wife reports he was recently evaluated for this and 
started on remeron. Following cessation of levofloxacin the 
patients visual hallucinations resolved and he was felt to be at 
baseline on discharge. 
.
#  ESRD s/p RENAL TRANSPLANT: He was continued on prednisone and 
tacrolimus. He was continued on bactrim adn fluconazole 
prophylaxis. Tacrolimus level was monitored daily while 
hospitalized. His tacrolimus dose was decreased to 0.5mg twice a 
day due to slightly elevated tacrolimus level at discharge. 
Please check tacrolimus level, chem-7, phosphate, calcium, CBC, 
AST, ALT, urinalysis, and urine protein/creatinine ratio weekly 
(every ___ and fax results to ___
.
#CAD: No symptoms concerning for ischemia at this time. He was 
continued on metoprolol, imdur, aspirin, and statin. 
.  
#DIABETES: He was continued on his home dose of lantus and 
sliding scale. 
.
#HYPERTENSION: He was continued on his home dose of amlodipine. 
.
#PVD: He was continued on aspirin and plavix. 
.
#CHRONIC CHF W/ PRESERVED EF: His lasix was initially held in 
the setting of acute kidney injury. This was restarted on ___ 
prior to discharge. 
.
#GERD: Found to have evidence of mild to moderate gastritis and 
esophagitis on endoscopy. He was started on omeprazole 20mg 
twice daily
.
#CHRONIC PAIN: Patient should get tylenol around the clock. His 
pain seemed to be adequately controlled wtih this. If pain 
despite this can do oxycodone 1 Q6hr PRN. But we discussed with 
him and wife that we should limit this due to side effect for 
slow Gi transit time.
.
#HEMORRHOID: He was given hemorroid suppository as needed 
.
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: 
1. GI follow up regarding biopsy results and H.pylori and 
recommend further gastroparesis treatment  
2. Please check tacrolimus level, chem-7, phosphate, calcium, 
CBC, AST, ALT, urinalysis, and urine protein/creatinine ratio 
weekly (every ___ and fax results to ___
3. His coumadin dosing might require further adjusment as it was 
elevated at discharge
4. Monitor creatinine and PO intake and decrease lasix as needed
5. Urine culture pending at discharge. Will inform you of final 
results at discharge. If patient develops symptoms concerning 
for foley catheter associated UTI then would have low threshold 
to treat with antibiotics.

Discharge Diagnosis:
Acute kidney injury
Medication induced dystonic reaction
supratherapeutinc INR
Nausea
Visual hallucinations

 
Discharge Condition:
Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Level of Consciousness: Alert and interactive.
Activity Status: Ambulatory - Independent.

 
Discharge Instructions:
It was a pleasure to participate in your care. You were admitted 
with upper extremity and facial twitching. This was likely a 
dystonic reaction to a medication. Your nausea medications as 
well as the antibiotic were stopped. Your symptoms resolved. 

Your kidney function was found to be worse than normal. This was 
likely due to dehdydration due to poor oral intake of nutrition. 
You were given intravenous fluids and your kidney function 
improved. 

Your coumadin level (INR) was found to be higher than normal. 
This was likely due to poor nutrition and the antibiotic you 
have been taking. You were given Vitamin K and your INR was at 
the appropriate level. 

Your foot ulcers were evaluated by the podiatry service. Your 
exam was not concerning for infection. The antibiotic you were 
on was stopped. Local wound care was continued. 

You reported nausea and vomitting for several months. You had a 
study that showed you have slow emptying of food/liquid from 
your stomach (called delayed gastric emptying).  You were seen 
by the gastrointestinology service. You underwent an upper 
endoscopy (EGD), which revealed inflammation of your stomach and 
esophagus. You were started on a medication to help with this 
condition.

You had some diarrhea. You were found to have an infection 
called C. difficile (C. Diff).  You were started on an 
antibiotic for this. You will need to continue this for the next 
six weeks. 

You developed urine retention. We started a medication for this 
called tamsulosin. You will have intermittent straight 
catheterizatino until pass your voiding trial.  A urine culture 
is pending at discharge. 

Please continue your home medications with the following 
changes: 
1. STOP taking levofloxacin
2. STOP taking zofran
3. START taking vancomycin
4. START taking omeprazole 
5. DECREASE your tacrolimus to 0.5mg twice a day
6. START taking tamsulosin

Brief Hospital Course:
MR. ___ was a ___ year-old man with DM1, CAD s/p CABGx4, CKD 
s/p renal transplant ___ years ago, PVD s/p right popliteal stent, 
recurrent foot ulcers who presented with a worsening diabetic 
foot ulcer over lateral aspect of the left ___ MTP with 
underlying osteomyelitis requiring left ___ metatarsal 
amputation.   

# Left foot ulcer with underlying osteomyelitis.
The patient has poor substrate for infection given h/o of DM and 
revascularized PVD as well as recent trauma, and an 
immunocompromised host. He displayed no systemic signs of 
infection. He was started on vancomycin and zosyn for a 
polymicrobial diabetic foot infection. Vascular surgery was 
consulted regarding need for revascularization before operation 
to remove infected bone. ABI with PVR were not suggestive of 
need for revascularization. Patient was taken to operating room 
by podiatry for removal of left fifth metatarsal given 
osteomyelitis. Tissue from surgery showing swarming Proteus and 
corynebacterium. 

He will continue on vancomycin and ertapenem to complete a 6 
week course with projected stop date of ___. 

He also has many wounds on his lower extremity documented at 
admission that will need further wound care as outlined in the 
discharge planning. 
 
#. Type 1 Diabetes (A1c 9.8): Blood glucose has been elevated at 
home per patient. He takes 30 units of lantus daily at noon. 
Outpatient optimization is advised to meet better A1c goal.  

# Acute kidney injury: Patient Cr on admission 1.5 (baseline 
1.2) in setting of pre-renal ___ that resolved with gentle 
hydration and PO intake. 
  
#. Coronary artery disease and peripheral vascular disease
Patient was continued on plavix, aspirin, statin, lasix 40 mg PO 
BID, metoprolol.
  
#. Renal transplant 
Patient was continued on home medications including tacrolimus, 
prednisone, bactrim, and fluconazole. 
 
# History of DVT
Patient will need anticoagulation for life with warfarin given 
prior DVT. 
His INR at discharge was 2.2 on warfarin 3mg PO qD. He will need 
weekly monitoring of INR.

IMAGING:
CT HEAD: There is no evidence of hemorrhage, edema, large 
masses, mass 
effect, or acute infarction. The ventricles and sulci are 
prominent 
consistent with age-related parenchymal involution. Intra- 
andextracranial 
vascular calcifications are identified including within the 
vertebral and 
carotid siphons. No fractures are identified. The visualized 
portions of the paranasal sinuses, mastoid air cells, and middle 
ear cavities are clear. No soft tissue swelling identified. 
IMPRESSION: No acute process. 
.
CXR: Overall central vascular congestion with mild early 
interstitial edema noted. No definite pneumonia. Otherwise 
numerous incidental findings stable with the exception of the 
removal in the interval of the PICC line. 
.
L SHOULDER X-RAY: IMPRESSION: No fracture or evidence of 
infection.
.
CT CHEST: 
1. New scattered bronchocentric ground-glass opacities are 
consistent with 
infection particularly in light of confusion and fever, fungal 
and viral 
etiologies are considered probable given the ground-glass 
appearance and 
history of immunosuppression. Drug-induced organizing pneumonia 
caused by tacrolimus therapy can also produce this appearance, 
but is less likely to cause the reported clinical abnormalities. 
The right upper lobe ground glass opacity is peripheral and may 
be an appropriate site for wedge resection, if this is being 
considered.  
2. Stable appearance of the right upper lobe wedge resection 
site and left upper lobe lobulated nodule, given the lack of 
growth of the left upper lobe lesion, this is probably benign 
and may represent the same process as the previously resected 
lesion in the right upper lobe.  
3. New small bilateral pleural effusions. 
4. Extensive atherosclerotic calcification of the thoracic 
aorta, abdominal aorta and coronary arteries. 
.
RIGHT FOOT X-RAY: Marked dorsal soft tissue swelling with 
possible subcutaneous emphysema. No definite osteomyelitis. 
.
EKG: Sinus rhythm with a ventricular premature beat. Low limb 
lead voltage. ST-T wave abnormalities. Since the previous 
tracing of ___ differences in baseline make comparison 
difficult. ST-T wave abnormalities may now be less prominent. 
.
MICROBIOLGY:
Urine Culture: negative
Cryptococcal Antigen: negative
Legionella Ag: negative
C.Diff toxin: negative
B-Glucan: <31 pg/mL (negative)
.
PENDING LABS:
Blood cultures (NGTD)
Galactomannan

 
Brief Hospital Course:
The patient is a ___ male with CKD status-post renal 
allograft ___ on tacrolimus and prednisone, recently admitted 
for diabetic foot ulcer, undergoing treatment with ertapenem and 
daptomycin for a planned 6 week course who became progressively 
confused at rehab, noted to have positive c. difficile toxin.  
.  
# Altered Mental Status/Fever: Alteration in mental status 
believed to be delirium in setting of infection, as patient 
presented with report of positive c.diff toxin at rehab and 
profuse diarrhea. CT head was negative for acute process. Low 
suspicion for CNS infection; LP was deferred on admission given 
INR>5 (see below). Blood cultures with no growth at the time of 
discharge. Urine culture was negative. CXR demonstrated right 
upper lung opacities to be followed as an outpatient (see below 
for further discussion). On presentation, patient was started on 
PO vancomycin, meropenem, and vancomycin (given poor lung 
penetration of daptomycin). Per ID recommendation, the patient 
was transitioned to tigecycline and renally-dosed ciprofloxacin 
at the time of discharge. These antibiotics are to be continued 
until follow-up with ID on ___. PICC line was placed on 
___. The patient's mental status improved with therapy, 
though he did have intermittent hallucinations throughout his 
hospital course. He was evaluated by psychiatry, who felt that 
his hallucinations represented delirium. At the time of 
discharge, he was alert and oriented times three, without 
evidence of hallucination.
.  
# RUL opacities: CXR at presentation showed right upper lung 
opacities suspicious for infection. He had no cough, hypoxia, or 
shortness of breath. CT Chest was obtained, which showed "new 
scattered bronchocentric ground-glass opacities consistent with 
infection particularly in light of confusion and fever, fungal 
and viral etiologies are considered probable given the 
ground-glass appearance and history of immunosuppression." 
Cryptococcal and Legionella antigen were negative. Induced 
sputum was unable to be obtained by respiratory therapy. The 
decision was made to follow this abnormality with a re-peat 
Chest CT in 1 months time rather than subject the patient to 
bronchoscopy (given his lack of respiratory symptoms and 
improvement in mental status).
. 
# Diabetic foot ulcer/osteomyelitis: Previously evaluated by ID 
team during recent admission; recommended 6 week course of 
vancomycin and ertapenem. Prior to this hospitalization (while 
at rehab), the patient was switched from vancomycin to 
daptomycin given increased creatinine. Per ID recommendation, 
the patient was transitioned to tigecycline and ciprofloxacin 
during this hospital stay. Wound care service followed patient 
in house. There was concern for onset of infection in right foot 
for which X-ray was obtained. However, patient was evaluated by 
podiatry, who felt that there was no evidence of worsening 
infection. He will follow-up with Podiatry as an outpatient.
.  
# Acute kidney injury: Cr peaked at 2.2. Infection suggestive of 
pre-renal etiology. Creatinine began downward trend with fluid 
administration and removal of diuretics. At the time of 
discharge, Cr was 1.8. 
.  
# Type 1 Diabetes (A1c 9.8): Patient's blood sugars were 
initially high in the setting of infection, and his lantus was 
uptitrated. After uptitration, he developed hypoglycemia. His 
lantus was resumed at his home dose (9 units daily) with good 
glucose control.  
.  
# Elevated INR: Likely elevated secondary to antibiotics in 
setting of chronic warfarin. The patient's coumadin was 
initially held, and subsequently re-started at a lower dose. At 
the time of discharge, INR was 3.5; coumadin was held. He will 
require a re-peat INR on ___. A decision can be made at this 
time about dosing.
.  
# Transaminitis: Unclear etiology. Trended down by the time of 
discharge.  
.  
# CAD and PVD: Continued plavix, aspirin, statin, and 
metoprolol.  
.  
# Status-post renal transplant: Patient's tacrolimus level 
ranged from 4.5-13.7 during admission. His tacrolimus dose was 
reduced to 0.5 mg BID. He may require titration of tacrolimus 
dose in setting of tigecycline. He was continued on prednisone, 
bactrim and fluconazole for prophylaxis.
.  
# Transitions of Care:
- Please check the following labs on ___ and ___: 
INR and tacrolimus level. Please re-start and/or adjust coumadin 
to achieve goal level ___. Please fax results of tacrolimus 
level to ___ at ___.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ is a ___ yo male with a history of T1DM s/p cadoveric 
renal transplant, chronic RLE ulcers, and IVC filter on 
coumadin, who was admitted with DKA in the setting of one week 
of N/V, diarrhea and fevers.

#. DKA: Thought ___ infection (MRSA bacteremia and C diff 
colitis found in workup)  He received aggressive IVF and IV 
insulin bolus but no gtt.  His gap closed overnight in the ICU.  
EKG without signs of active ischemia.  He was restarted on his 
home insulin regimen once gap closed, with no further incidents.

#. R FOOT ULCER/CELLULITIS: was previously treated with 
linezolid and followed by podiatry as out-patient; seen by 
vascular and podiatry on admission.  He was started on vanco and 
unasyn on admission, and this was narrowed to just vanco after 
his culture data returned.  Initial wound swab grew MRSA and was 
the likely source of MRSA bacteremia. He underwent debridement 
in OR by podiatry on ___, cultures sent from OR and also grew 
MRSA. ID consulted and suggested 6 weeks vancomycin: his wound 
probes to bone so there was certainly concern for osteomyelitis. 
Pathology eventually confirmed acute osteomyelitis. He will 
follow up with Dr. ___ podiatry.

#  MRSA BACTEREMIA:  ___ sets on admission.  Source likely foot 
ulcer.  TTE negative.  Surveillance blood cultures neg to date. 
Treating with 6 weeks vancomycin as above.

#. NAUSEA/VOMITING, DIARRHEA, C DIFF COLITIS:  sx improved with 
appropriate tx with flagyl. Will be treated with 2 weeks Flagyl 
and if diarrhea recurs while on vancomycin, will consider 
retreating with Flagyl.

#. SOB: sx resolved without further intervention.  No signs ACS 
or pneumonia.  Low suspicion PE.  No hypoxia

#. Right knee pain: There was initially significant concern for 
possible septic knee in the setting of MRSA bacteremia; however 
on further evaluation by rheum, they reported that he had no 
effusion, no fluid for arthrocentesis.  Their differential 
included CPPD/crystalline disease, other musculoskeletal such as 
meniscal tear, avascular necrosis (chronic steroids), occult 
fracture. MRI showed no evidence of meniscal or ligamentous 
injury, non-specific circumferential subcutaneous edema, and 
only trace joint fluid. His pain improved with conservative 
management.

#. Coagulopathy: INR 20 on presentation likely ___ diarrhea and 
poor PO intake over last week; received 1 unit FFP in the ED as 
well as vitamin K.  INR improved to 6.  We held coumadin but 
also gave no further vitamin K in the ICU. His INR was allowed 
to drift down and was 3.7 on discharge. He will follow up with 
___ clinic who will determine when he will restart 
coumadin.

#. ARF: Cr 2.1 on admission; with IVF in ED.  Likely prerenal as 
it improved with appropriate hydration.  Continued 
prednisone/prograf for renal allograft. On resumption of his 
outpatient diuretics, his creatinine started rising again. 
Diuretics were held as urine lytes suggested this was again 
prerenal. Given his worsening lower extremity edema and after 
his creatinine had stabilized around 1.7-1.8, Lasix was 
restarted at 40mg qd and florinef was stopped.

#. Hx heavy EtOH use: ciwa scale and mvi/folate/thiamine; no 
signs withdrawal so CIWA discontinued.

# T1 DM, uncontrolled with complications:  as above, DKA 
resolved with appropriate insulin IV in ICU and tx of multiple 
infections.

# CAD s/p CABG: continued ASA, Plavix

# Anemia: he was guaiac negative and iron studies were 
consistent with ACD. Procrit was started in-house, to be 
continued as an outpatient.

one diabetes mellitus c/b retinopathy, neuropathy, nephropathy, 
CAD s/p CABGx4,PVD s/p right popliteal stent, recurrent C. diff, 
R foot MRSA osteomyelitis, and ___ who presents with protracted 
nausea, vomiting, diarrhea.

ACTIVE ISSUES

1. NAUSEA/VOMITING/DIARRHEA:  He presented with about 2 months 
of diarrhea and abdominal distress and frequent nausea, 
reporting periods of increased watery bowel movements with a 
waxing and waning pace to improvement.  A broad workup was 
largely negative.  Stool cultures for 
shigella/salmonella/campylobacter were negative both before and 
during admission.  C diff assays were negative times 2.  CMV 
viral load negative. Ova and parasites likewise negative (was 
travelling in ___.  Normal antiTTG ruled out Celiac.  TSH was 
elevated to 13 but normal T4 and FT4.  GI team was eventually 
consulted following this negative workup- they feel he may 
benefit from outpatient colonoscopy for further evaluation.  His 
diarrhea ceased while in house, with ___ loose but formed BM 
daily.  His poor appetite persisted. 

2. ACUTE KIDNEY INJURY:  He presented with a creatinine of 3.5 
from a baseline in the 1.5 range.  His depressed FeNa 
corresponded with profoundly poor PO intake over the preceding 
month. He was hydrated gently and his lasix was held with 
excellent effect- Cr 1.1 on discharge.  Transplant ultrasound 
showed no evidence of acute rejection.

3. ESRD s/p RENAL TRANSPLANT:  His tacro dose was decreased from 
1.5BID to 1mg BID following an elevated tacro level to 15.  He 
continued the same prednisone 5mg daily dose.  He has followup 
in the transplant clinic post discharge.

4. DIABETES MELLITUS, TYPE 1:  He presented with FSG to 600, 
though was persistently hypoglycemic in the morning to ___.  His 
lantus was decreased slowly to 12units daily on discharge. 
___ consulted with the attached sliding scale recommended. As 
he began to eat, FSG trended up to 300-400s.

5. CALCANEAL/LOWER EXTREMITY ULCERS: he has large calcaneal 
ulcerations bilaterally, right dorsal skin breakdown, and 
partial skin breakdown over the lower extremity related to poor 
healing from DM1, PVD, and chronic steroids. Wound care 
consulted with attached recommendations.  Podiatry consulted for 
foot care and ?osteo- foot XR showed no evidence of infection 
and no debridement was felt to be necessary, will f/u as an 
outpatient.

6. SUBCLINICAL HYPOTHYROIDISM:  TSH elevated to 13 with normal 
T4 and FT4, recommended to recheck TSH as outpt.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___, 

You were admitted to the hospital with nausea and vomiting and 
very poor oral intake for over a month.  Your kidney transplant 
was injured, but recovered significantly with intravenous fluid 
and time.  We sent many tests to uncover the cause of your 
diarrhea and abdominal pain, though all tests were negative. The 
GI team consulted, and you may benefit from a colonoscopy in the 
future to help determine the cause.

Your blood sugar was very low on multiple occasions during your 
hospitalization, despite giving you much less insulin than 
normal. This was because you are not eating- it is very 
important that you try to eat when possible, as your blood 
glucose varies wildly.  You were seen by the diabetes doctors 
who made several recommendations regarding your insulin.

The following changes were made to your medications
1. DECREASE TACROLIMUS to 1mg TWICE A DAY
2. DECREASE GLARGINE TO 12units daily in the AM- PLEASE CHECK 
YOUR FINGERSTICKS MULTIPLE TIMES A DAY
3. CHANGE your humalog sliding scale to the attached sheet
4. DECREASE lasix to 40mg ONCE daily
5. INCREASE warfarin to 1mg daily

Please continue all other previously prescribed medications

It was a pleasure working with you, Mr. ___

with good leaflet excursion. No aortic regurgitation. The mitral 
valve leaflets are structurally normal. There is no mitral valve 
prolapse. Trivial mitral regurgitation. No mass or vegetation is 
seen on the mitral valve. The left ventricular inflow pattern

on the tricuspid valve, but cannot be fully excluded due to 
suboptimal image quality. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure 
could not be determined. 
IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. No evidence of 
endocarditis, but suboptimal quality to fully exclude. If 
clinically indicated, a TEE may better assess for vegetations. 
Preserved biventricular global systolic function. Impaired 
relaxation pattern. 
.
___ Renal US: No significant abnormality and no change 
since one year prior.
.
___ MR ankle without contrast: 1. Fluid collection at the 
dorsal aspect of the medial midfoot, contiguous with fluid 
within the tarsometatarsal joints. 
2. Extensive edema in the cuneiforms, cuboid, and proximal 
metatarsals, with loss of cortical definition and erosions, 
consistent with osteomyelitis. Extensive subcutaneous edema, 
consistent with cellulitis. 
3. Lisfranc fracture-dislocation, with widening of the 
interspace between the first and second metatarsals. 
4. Pes planus deformity and fragmentation of the navicular, 
consistent with
Charcot arthropathy. 
5. Peroneus longus and brevis tendon tears inferior to the 
lateral malleolus. 
6. Anterior talofibular ligament tear, likely chronic. 
7. Disruption of the lateral band of the plantar fascia. 
Abnormal thickening of the medial band of the plantar fascia. 
.
___ Ext Arterogram: Findings consistent with significant 
right femoral and tibial as well as left tibial arterial 
disease. The study is difficult to interpret, apparently the 
patient has very calcific atherosclerotic plaque formation which 
makes some of the waveforms as well as the segmental limb 
pressures inaccurate. 
  

 
Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ is a ___ yo M with PMH of kidney transplant ___ years 
ago, DM1, CAD s/p CABG and MI, chronic right foot ulceration who 
presents with nausea, vomiting and diarrhea.  
.  
# n/v/diarrhea: DDX for the n/v/diarrhea include a viral 
gastroenteritis which led to dehydration and acute on chronic 
renal failure, UTI or other infection- likely in foot and/or 
right hand. The pt's nausea on the floor was well managed with 
IV antiemetics.  He had no more diarrhea or vomitting once he 
got to the floor. He received 2L IVF in the ED and 1 more L on 
arrival to the floor. On discharge, he is tolerating a regular 
diet well with minimal nausea.  
.  
# cellulitis/chronic osteomyelitis: Followed by ___ clinic as 
outpatient and podiatry. Unclear if erythema is worse currently. 
Appears to be half way up the right calf and may be worse per 
patient. Erythema on dorsum of right hand is currently mild and 
hand is pruritic per patient. Xray of the foot and MRI were 
consistent with osteomyelitis. Cultures grew MRSA. Pt was taken 
to the OR by podiatry for exploration and debridement on ___. 
He was placed on vancomycin which he will continue via his PICC 
with ___ services at home for at least 6 wks with weekly labs 
and close follow up with podiatry and ID. On discharge, the 
erythema on the hand was almost completely resolved.
.  
# acute on chronic renal failure: s/p cadaveric kidney 
transplant ___ years ago. Renal failure on admission likely 
pre-renal given dehydration (Cr 2.2 on admission). Must also 
consider rejection given he is not sure he kept his medications 
down with the vomiting or infection. Not likely post-renal given 
no hydronephrosis on imaging and pt able to make urine. Pt's 
wife reports he is compliant with all his immunosuppressants at 
home. Cr rose to 3.2 but was down to 2.6 at time of discharge. 
Pt has planned f/u with renal transplant team.
.  
# DM1 with complications: Pt was continued on his home insulin 
regimen with good control of his sugars here and discharged on 
the same.  On diabetic diet. 
.  
# supratherapeutic INR: INR was 10 on admission. On life long 
coumadin given multiple DVT s/p IVC filter. Given 5mg IV vit K 
in ED. No signs of bleeding on exam. CT abdomen was negative for 
bleed.  INR normalized and pt was restarted on 1.5mg coumadin 
daily with close f/u and INR checks.  
.  
# HTN: Continued metoprolol. Held furosemide given dehydration 
and ARF. Pt will restart these as an outpt.  
.  
# chronic diastolic CHF: mild LVH on echo in ___. LVEF greater 
than 55%. On furosemide and metalozone at home. Held in house 
given acute on chronic renal failure to be restarted as an 
outpt.  
.  
# CAD: Continued aspirin, plavix, imdur, atorvastatin, 
metoprolol  
.  
# anemia: likely secondary to renal failure. Currently, just 
above baseline currently. Continued B vitamins and home dose 
procrit.  
.  
# h/o cryptococcal pneumonia: Continued fluconazole suppression 
therapy.

Brief Hospital Course:
BRIEF HOSPITAL COURSE:
=============================
___ with h/o CAD s/p CABG and PCI, dHF, ESRD s/p cadaveric renal 
transplant ___ ___, IDDM1, extensive PVD with chronic venous 
ulcers, h/o DVTs s/p IVC filter on warfarin, and new onset AFib, 
who was transferred from ___ ___ for further 
management of uroseptic shock ___ VRE UTI (briefly requiring 
pressors), hypoxemic respiratory failure (s/p extubation), now 
w/ stable/improved clinical status upon discharge.

ACTIVE ISSUES:
=============================
# Uroseptic shock:
On presentation to ___, pt was hypotensive (requiring 
pressors) and hypoxemic (requiring intubation) ___ septic shock. 
Once broad spectrum Abx and IVF resuscitation were started, pt 
rapidly improved and was soon titrated off pressors and 
extubated. 

Septic shock was later found to be ___ VRE UTI (identified from 
OSH UCx) but interestingly, pt improved on empiric broad 
spectrum antibiotics (Vancomycin, Cefepime, Flagyl) that were 
started on admission rior to pathogen identification. Before VRE 
UTI was identified, pt was also evaluated by ACS and vascular 
surgery to determine whether or not his chronic venous stasis 
ulcers were infected. Both services felt that ulcer infection, 
osteomyelitis, or necrotizing fasciitis were highly unlikely. 
GNR identified ___ sputum likely reflected colonization ___ the 
absence of focal infiltrate on serial CXRs. 

Though septic shock was ultimately thought to be ___ VRE UTI 
(identified from OSH UCx), pt improved on empiric broad spectrum 
antibiotics (Vancomycin, Cefepime, Flagyl) prior to pathogen 
identification. Once pathogen was identified as VRE, pt was 
started on PO Linezolid and all other Abx were discontinued. 
After Abx were transitioned, pt maintained normal vital signs, 
afebrile status, and did not have an elevated white blood cell 
count. Given that pathogen was VRE, pt will need to be treated 
for complicated UTI for 14 days with PO linezolid 
(___).

# Respiratory Failure: 
Pt was intubated transiently for respiratory failure presumed 
secondary to septic shock but was successfully extubated s/p 
resucitation and maintained O2 saturation of 98-100% on RA 
thereafter. 

# AoCKI: 
On transfer to ___, Cr was 3.5 from 1.6 at baseline ___ the 
setting of known ESRD s/p cadaveric renal transplant, likely 
reflecting uroseptic shock. Renal transplant ultasound on 
admission demonstrated preserved graft and no evidence of 
obstruction. On transfer to the medicine service, Cr had 
improved to 2.7 with treatment of infection and was 1.3 on day 
of discharge. Over duration of hospitalization, pt continued to 
make appropriate UOP and did not require further IVF. Given 
aggresive fluid resuscitation over hospitalization, pt was 
significantly volume overloaded (compounded by low albumin) and 
was briefly diuresed w/ IV lasix. 

As per renal transplant, he was continued on immunosuppressants 
(tacrolimus/prednisone) and associated infectious prophylaxis 
(fluconazole/Bactrim) therapies. 

#Decompensated dHF: 
Pt has known hx of dHF, as well as CKI as above, and appeared 
volume overloaded on transfer to medicine service that was 
likely ___ aggressive IVF resuscitation for urosepsis and third 
spacing ___ low albumin (1.8). He was diuresed with IV 
furosemide ___ MICU previously, and briefly on the medicine 
service, but was autodiuresing appropriately as Cr improved so 
additional diuresis was held. Fortunately, pt was noted to be 
breathing well w/o orthopnea. He was restarted on home dose 
torsemide upon discharge. 

#Supratherapeutic INR: 
INR peaked ~7.8 on this admission ___ the setting of home 
warfarin use for atrial fibrillation, perhaps compounded by poor 
PO intake and antibiotic use. He received 5mg IV vitamin K prior 
to transfer to the medicine service and was 1.5 the day after. 
Given subtherapeutic INR, hx of DVT (s/p IVC filter) and AFib, 
he was bridged w/ heparin gtt until warfarin became therapeutic 
at his home dose (0.5mg). 

# Normocytic anemia: 
Hct was 28.3 on transfer to medicine service, consistent with 
recent baseline. Anemia was investigated extensively on his 
___ admission, and he was started on ferrous sulfate for 
possible iron deficiency anemia. Initiation of erythropoietin 
was apparently discussed with nephrology and deferred. There had 
been no evidence of active bleeding on this admission despite 
supratherapeutic INR. Pt has no hx of abnormal bleeding. His H/H 
remained stable throughout the remaineder of his hospital course 
and he was continued on home dose ferrous sulfate.

#Chronic venous ulcers and Sacral Ulcer:
Pt has known hx of chronic venous ulcers and was noted to have 
multiple areas of ulceration on upper and lower 
extremities.Before VRE UTI was identified, pt was also evaluated 
by ACS and vascular surgery to determine whether or not his 
chronic venous stasis ulcers were infected. Both services felt 
that ulcer infection, osteomyelitis, or necrotizing fasciitis 
were highly unlikely. Wound care and nutrition consult teams 
evaluated pt and made recommendations which were implemented. 

# IDDM1: 
Pt was continued on glargine and humalog ISS.  

# Atrial fibrillation: 
He was noted on this admission to be ___ rate-controlled atrial 
fibrillation ___ the absence of previous history, that was 
possibly ___ acute infection. CHADS score was 4 and pt had 
another indication for anticoagulation (DVT s/p IVC filter) so 
he was anticoagulated as above. Home dose metoprol was continued 
and pt remained within acceptable rate.

CHRONIC ISSUES:
=============================
# Chronic DVTs s/p IVC filter: 
INR peaked ~7.8 on this admission ___ the setting of home 
warfarin use for atrial fibrillation, perhaps compounded by poor 
PO intake and antibiotic use. He received 5mg IV vitamin K prior 
to transfer to the medicine service and was 1.5 the day after. 
Given subtherapeutic INR, hx of DVT (s/p IVC filter) and AFib, 
he was bridged w/ heparin gtt until warfarin became therapeutic 
at his home dose (0.5mg). 

# CAD s/p CABG and PCI:  
Pt was continued on his home dose metoprolol (briefly held 
during shock), copidogrel, and atorvastatin.

#H/o Cryptococcal pneumonia:
Pt was continued on home dose fluconazole prophylaxis.

# Depression: 
Given need for Linezolid, pt had mirtazipine discontinued 
temporarily as it may predispose pt to serotonin syndrome. Once 
antibiotic course is finished, he may be restarted on 
mirtazipine, following a proper medical evaluation.

# Malnutrition: Alb 1.7
Pt appeared severly malnourished and was noted to have an 
albumin of 1.7 that was likely contributing to hypervolemic 
state and preventing chronic venous ulcers from healing. 
Accordingly nutrition consult was placed and recommendations 
were implemented.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
===========================
1. Given VRE UTI, pt will need to continue a 14 day course of 
Linezolid (___) and be careful to withold 
mirtazapine ___ the meantime as the two drugs may interact and

.
#. Nausea/Vomitting/Dehydration: Patient presented with 
non-bilious non-blooding vomiting that was presumably due to a 
viral gastroenteritis. There was initial concern for possibly 
SBO but KUB demonstrated a non-obstructive bowel gas pattern. 
Right upper quadrant ultrasound was negative for cholecystitis 
and total bilirubin was normal. Lipase was normal making 
pancreatitis unlikely. Serum creatinine was elevated on 
admission and urine lytes indicated a pre-renal etiology. 
Patient improved with as needed Zofran and intravenous 
hydration. Patient was discharged home after several days of 
inpatient stay after significant improvement in his symptoms. 
.  
#. Elevated INR: Patient is on Coumadin for DVT s/p R popliteal 
stent.  INR was elevated as an outpatient at 18 and was 9.4 in 
ED. Patient reports strict compliance with warfarin dosing. INR 
was likely elevated due to poor nutritional status over the 
preceding one to two weeks. Patient reported several falls at 
home prior to admission. CT head on admission was negative for 
acute bleed. The patient recevied Vitamin K once during his 
hospitalization. INR was 1.3 at time of discharge at which time 
his Coumadin was restarted. The patient was given explicit 
instructions regarding his Coumadin dosing and that close 
monitoring of his INR was necessary. 
.  
#. ARF: Serum creatinine was 2.7 on admission. Pre-renal 
etiology was likely secondary to dehydration which urine lytes 
confirmed. Per notes, baseline Cr is 1.5-1.8. Creatinine 
improved to 1.2 with intravenous hydration. Creatinine remained 
at 1.2 after intravenous fluids were stopped and patient was 
able to tolerate adequate oral intake. 
.
#. Type 1 Diabetes: Patient reported poor glycemic control on 
admission. He was admitted on Lantus 36 units daily. The patient 
continued to have episodes of hypoglycemia throughout his 
admission, requiring several decreases in his Lantus dosing. The 
patient was discharged on Lantus 28 units daily with close 
follow up with his PCP. 
..  
#. CAD/PVD: The patient was continued on his home-dose of 
Plavix, Aspirin, Statin, Metoprolol, and Amlodipine throughout 
his hospitalization without adverse events. 
. 
#. Diastolic Heart Failure: The patient was hypovolemic on 
presentation. His Lasix was held in the setting of dehydration 
and acute renal failure. Lasix was restarted prior to discharge. 
Metoprolol was continued throughout his hospitalization.  
.  
#. Renal transplant: Patient was continued on his Tacrolimus 
throughout his hospitalization. Tacrolimus levels were > 7 
throughout admission. No dose adjustments were made. 
.
#. Falls: Patient reported ___t home. No evidence 
of fractures or intracranial head bleed on admission head CT. 
Patient had no falls during his hospitalization. Patient was 
instructed to follow up with his PCP as an outpatient.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___, 
You were admitted to the hospital because you were having nausea 
for 1.5 weeks and vomiting for a ___ days, in addition to 
fatigue.  Your kidney function had worsened temporarily because 
you were so dehydrated, but after getting IV fluids in the 
hospital, your kidney function has returned to its normal.  

It also seems that you had been falling frequently at home.  
Because your coumadin level (INR) had been high when you came 
in, we did not give you coumadin here for the first couple of 
days.  You should take a total of 3mg of coumadin tomorrow 
(___), then decrease the dose to 2mg on ___, 
___.  Please have your INR drawn by the Visiting Nurse or at 
___ ___ clinic on ___ (you will 
have an appointment with Dr. ___ on that same day).  It will be 
very important to follow up closely with your coumadin level 
because you have had high levels in the past couple of weeks, 
and you have been given some vitamin K in the last couple of 
weeks to decrease your levels. 

It seems also that you have had some lower blood sugars while in 
the hospital, which may be because you had not been eating as 
well as at home.  We have decreased your Lantus (glargine) 
insulin to 28 units each day for now to prevent further low 
blood sugars.  Please continue this lower dose until seen by 
your primary care physician on ___. 

The following changes have been made to your medications, as 
above: 
- warfarin (coumadin) - Please take 3mg tomorrow ___, then 
decrease to 2mg on ___.  Please have your INR 
drawn at HCA on ___ and await the instructions of 
the anticoagulation nurses
- please DECREASE your insulin glargine to 28 units each day 
until seen by Dr. ___ on ___.  Please check your 
blood sugars at home 4 times each day until you see Dr. ___ 
please record these blood sugars in a log for him to see: 
  1.) when you wake up prior to breakfast
  2.) just prior to lunch
  3.) just prior to dinner
  4.) at bedtime

No other changes have been made to your medications. 

I have provided you with a prescription for anti-nausea 
medication that you may use no more than once every 8 hours, but 
if nausea continues to be a big problem, please call your 
doctor's office. 

It was a pleasure taking care of you.

IMAGING
======== 
___ CXR
FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is 
known scarring at the bases of the right upper lobe, associated 
with a minor degree of volume loss as well as scarring in the 
left lung, the level of the upper and lower hilus.  Status post 
sternotomy and CABG.  Lung volumes are low.  There are no 
pleural effusions.  Normal size of the cardiac silhouette.  No 
pulmonary edema.  No pneumonia. 

___ RENAL U/S
IMPRESSION: 
1.  Little change compared to ___ with 
redemonstration of elevated intrarenal resistive indices with a 
maximum value of 0.93, which may be mildly increased since the 
prior, without discernable antegrade diastolic flow.  The 
intrarenal indices measure higher than on prior exam and may be 
increased particularly given sharper appearance of waveform 
though previously they were estimated to be higher than the 
given values.  Elevated peak systolic velocity of the main renal 
artery is decreased compared to ___ however, remains 
elevated compared to ___. 
2.  Extensive intrarenal vascular calcifications, unchanged. 
3.  Otherwise, no hydronephrosis, masses or perinephric fluid 
collection. 

___ CXR
IMPRESSION: 
1.  Endotracheal and enteric tubes in appropriate position. 
2.  Interval placement of a left-sided IJ central venous 
catheter terminating in the proximal SVC without evidence of 
pneumothorax. 
3.  Interval development of left base opacity, likely 
combination of left 
lower lobe collapse and pleural effusion.  Increased perihilar 
opacities 
suggest pulmonary edema. 

___ Tib/Fib xray
FINDINGS:  Generalized osteopenia.  Known Charcot arthropathy 
with a 
rocker-bottom foot deformity.  Status post second toe 
amputation.  Massive 
vascular soft tissue calcifications with stents and surgical 
material in situ. Zone of cortical thinning and mild soft tissue 
swelling at the level of the fibular shaft.  No evidence of 
fractures. 

___ abdominal xray
FINDINGS:  Two projections in supine body position are provided. 
 Severe 
vascular calcifications.  Inferior vena cava filter.  Clips 
projecting over the pelvis.  Partially collapsed colon and 
multiple gas filled but 
non-distended bowel loops are visualized.  No evidence of free 
intra-abdominal air. 

___ CXR
FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung 
volumes have 
increased, likely reflecting improved ventilation or increased 
ventilatory 
pressure.  A pre-existing opacity in the right lung has almost 
completely 
resolved.  On the left, atelectasis in the retrocardiac lung 
regions, a small perihilar opacity and a mild-to-moderate left 
pleural effusion, persist.  No new parenchymal opacities.  
Unchanged size of the cardiac silhouette. 

___ CXR
No new focal consolidations concerning for pneumonia. 

___ MRI CERVICAL/THORACIC SPINE
IMPRESSION:  Degenerative changes of the cervical spine, mildly 
progressed at C4-C5. Chronic compression deformities in the 
thoracic spine.  No acute findings noted. 

___ CXR
Mild pulmonary edema on the right and moderate pulmonary edema 
on the left have worsened since ___, both slightly less 
severe than on ___ when there was also asymmetry.  
Heart size is normal.  Small right and moderate left pleural 
effusions are stable.  Left internal jugular line ends in the 
mid SVC.  No pneumothorax. 

___ B/L ___
Study is limited by bilateral lower leg bandage material, which 
precludes visualization of the calf veins, as well as reduced 
ability to 
perform compression maneuvers in the setting of patient 
discomfort.  Allowing for this, no evidence of DVT in right or 
left lower extremities from common femoral to popliteal veins. 

___ B/L ___ ARTERIAL U/S
Patent bilateral lower extremity arterial systems with no 
evidence of focal velocity elevation 
  
___ TTE
The left atrium is moderately dilated. No atrial septal defect 
is seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thickness, 
cavity size and global systolic function are probably normal 
(LVEF >55%). There is no ventricular septal defect. with normal 
free wall contractility. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are 
mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic 
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly 
thickened. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. 
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There 
is no pericardial effusion. 
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of ___, LV 
systolic function appears less vigorous but still normal

___ CXR
There are persistent and slightly worsening opacities in the 
left upper and mid lung and right lower lung which would be 
concerning either for worsening edema or pneumonia.  Chain 
sutures are again identified abutting the minor fissure 
consistent with prior surgery.  Bilateral effusions, left 
greater than right, are again seen.  Persistent retrocardiac 
opacity may reflect compressive atelectasis, although infection 
in this region cannot be excluded. The patient is status post 
median sternotomy for CABG, but assessment of cardiac and 
mediastinal contours is difficult due to the patient's marked 
rotation on the current examination.  Left internal jugular 
central line continues to have its tip in the mid SVC.  Linear 
calcifications in the left upper hemithorax are felt to likely 
be pleural in etiology.  A portion of the inferior vena caval 
filter is imaged at the edge of the study. 
  
___ KUB
Nonspecific bowel gas pattern with no evidence of obstruction.  

___ NCHCT
No evidence for  infarction.  MRI is more sensitive for 
detecting acute 
ischemia. Slight increase in ventricular size from ___, 
likely 
reflecting progressive atrophy.   
  
___ UPPER EXTREMITY U/S WITH DOPPLER
No left upper extremity DVT

___ CXR
As compared to the previous radiograph, there is unchanged 
evidence 
of mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema.  The pre-existing scars in 
the lung 
parenchyma, notably at the left lung apex and left lung base are 
constant in appearance.  Constant size of the cardiac 
silhouette.  No larger pleural effusions.  The Dobbhoff catheter 
has been pulled back.  The catheter is now malpositioned in the 
esophagus and needs to be advanced by at least 10cm to ensure 
position in the stomach.  Unchanged position of the left PICC 
line.  Unchanged alignment of the sternotomy wires. 

___ CXR
The ___ tube appears to be in the oropharynx with the tip 
seen projecting over the mouth floor.  Pulmonary edema is 
present.  Bilateral pleural effusions are noted. 

___ RENAL U/S
1.  Mild improvement of vascular waveforms compared to ___, now with demonstration of minimal antegrade diastolic 
flow within the interlobar renal arteries as well as interval 
decrease in main renal artery peak systolic velocities. 
2.  Redemonstration of intrarenal vascular calcifications. 
3.  No hydronephrosis, masses or perinephric fluid collections 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ with PMHx renal transplant ___, IDDM, and chronic ___ ulcers 
who presents from ___ with N/V/D x 5d, weak 
and dizzy for several days, admitted with septic shock likely 
___ to HCAP with ___, hyperkalemia and hypotension, now 
extubated and with resolving infection, but course complicated 
by delirium, labile blood sugars, and malnutrition. 

ACUTE ISSUES
# Septic shock: Patient became hypotensive in the ED and was 
placed on 2 pressors and transferred to the ICU. Differential 
for shock most likely hypovolemic (poor PO and emesis), vs 
sepsis with possible sources: lung vs GI vs skin/soft tissue 
infection. He does have CAD history, though thought less likely 
to be cardiogenic, despite initial changes on EKG and elevated 
troponins. Lactate not significantly elevated, but SvO2 
initially high and downtrended with fluid resuscitation. He was 
weaned off of pressors, and maintained on antibiotics for 
possible pneumonia vs osteomyelitis. Given that CXR blossomed 
and revealed LUL consolidation and possible RLL opacity as well, 
it was thought that the patient had become septic ___ to 
evolving PNA. Antibiotics included vanco/cefepime/flagyl 
initially, but were narrowed to vanc/cefepime. Once the patient 
was hemodynamically stable, he was transferred out of the ICU. 
While on the floor, the patient completed his full 14 day 
antibiotic course of the vanc and cefepime. He remained afebrile 
and hemodynamically stable throughout the remainder of his 
admission. 

# Respiratory failure: Patient was intubated in the ED for 
increased work of bleeding and tachypnea, without hypoxia. 
Likely respiratory compensation for metabolic acidosis. He was 
extubated ___ without incident. Finding of pulmonary opacities 
concerning for pneumonia, antibiotics as above.  

# ___ with resultant acidosis and hyperkalemia: Cr increase from 
1.0 to 4.8 on presentation. Likely prerenal with hypovolemia 
from recent GI illness, improved with fluid resuscitation. Cr 
trended down and plateaued in 2.0's, likely from ATN component 
from hypotension. Less likely concern for tacro toxicity or 
rejection.  Renal u/s normal. Related acidosis and hyperkalemia, 
without peaked T on EKG. Improved with IVF, but oliguric. 
Subsequently Cr trending down into the 1.0-1.3 range. Of note, 
later during the admission, Cr uptrended once again to peak of 
1.9. Urine revealed muddy brown casts, c/w with ATN, thought to 
be ___ to brief episode of hypotension with SBPs into the ___ on 
the floor. Renal u/s repeated, which again was wnl. Cr at the 
time of discharge downtrending and 1.6. Cr should be checked 
within the next week as an outpatient to ensure improvement, 
although this could be the patient's new baseline. 

# Fluid overload: Patient was given 12L in ICU for fluid 
rescusitation with septic shock. While on the floor the patient 
was noted to have mild dyspnea, moderately elevated JVP, 
crackles in lungs, and moderate sacral edema. CXR revealed 
pulmonary edema likely ___ volume overload from fluid 
resuscitation. The patient was intially diuresed with IV 
furosemide and responded well with good UOP and improvement in 
respiratory status. The patient was transitioned to PO torsemide 
80 mg QD prior to discharge. 

# Delirium: Patient was noted to have waxing/waning mental 
status for a period of ___ days during the admission while on 
the floor. Deliriogenic medications, including IV dilaudid was 
stopped. Blood sugars were not well controlled ___ to 
inconsistent PO intake, with brief episodes of intermittent, 
asymptomatic hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia without DKA. This 
was, therefore, thought to be partially be contintributing to 
his altered mental status. ___ did not reveal CVA or acute 
changes, but did note some global atrophy. With better control 
of blood sugars the patient's mental status gradually cleared. 
At the time of discharge the patient was alert and oriented x 3 
without any focal neurologic deficits. 

# Type 1 diabetes: Patient had an extremely tenuous course with 
regard to his blood sugars. He had inconsistent PO intake, which 
made appropriate control difficult. ___ was consulted and 
recommended the current regimen of glargine 6 U at lunch and 2 U 
at dinner with ISS. Patients blood sugars were generally 
130-200s prior to discharge. However, on the morning of 
discharge, BS dropped to 42, which was asymptomatic. Patient was 
given apple juice with return of BS to 92. ___ 
was called and informed to hold the patient's bedtime 2U of 
glargine on ___ and re-assess his AM blood sugars on 
___. Based on his outpatient eating habits and trends, the 
patient's outpatient physicians ___ have to continually 
re-evaluate his blood sugars and make adjustement to the 
patient's insulin dosing regimen, as needed.

# Poor PO intake: The patient has a long-standing history of 
poor PO intake. Upon admission he had significant muscle 
weakness and multiple skin lesions, which were thought to be due 
to dietary deficiency. MRI of the spine was performed to rule 
out any organic cause for the patient's weakness, but was found 
to be wnl. Nutrition was consulted and recommended placing 
Dobhoff tube, which was placed and remained in placed for about 
___ days. NGT subsequently became malpositioned during an 
episode of delirium and was removed. Once the patient's mental 
status returned to baseline and the patient was A&Ox3, a long 
discussion was had about re-placing the NGT. The patient did not 
want NGT placed. Patient was able to state that if NGT not 
placed and he continues to not eat he will become nutritionally 
deficient and could die. Patient also expressed his desire to 
stay alive. Discussed that if he wanted to stay healthy that he 
would have to eat more. Patient understood and stated that he 
would make an increased effort in the future. The patient's wife 
also agreed to be more involved in his nutrition and would bring 
him at least one meal daily to his nursing home. 

# Anemia: Patient noted on a few occasions during this admission 
to have Hgb ___ with low MCVs. These episodes have always follow 
slow declines in H/H. Hemolysis labs negative. Patient without 
any obvious source of bleeding and stool guiac negative. Iron 
studies show TIBC low, iron low, and ferritin wnl. Retic count 
only 3.9 and with such a low Hgb would potentially expect a 
better response if he was truly iron replete. B12 high. Likely 
___ to anemia of chronic disease with sequestering of iron 
stores preventing a truley robust retic response. The patient 
was transfused with a total of 3 U pRBCs during this admission 
(1 U on three separate occasions) all with appropriate increases 
in Hct. Prior to discharge the patient was started on daily iron 
supplementation. Initiating Epo was discussed with renal, but 
not felt to be necessary at this time, though epo levels are 
pending. Hct at the time of discharge was 29.4.

# Diarrhea: History of N/V/D prior to admission, but appeared to 
have resolved upon admission. Later during the admission the 
patient did have more diarrhea, but C. diff studies were 
negative. Patient maintained on loperamide PRN. 

# Urinary retention: During this admission the patient initially 
required a foley for urine output monitoring. The foley was 
attempted to be removed on multiple occasions, but the patient 
would subsequently develop urinary retention noted on bladder 
scanning and require foley replacement.  Of note, medications 
were evaluated and no new anticholinergics or other meds with 
known s/e of urinary retention were found. Due to low normal 
SBPs during this admission, tamsulosin was held, but was 
restarted at the time of discharge. The patient will be 
discharged with foley in place with plan to see Urology as an 
outpatient for a voiding trial with tamsulosin on board.

CHRONIC ISSUES
# PVD/leg ulcers/osteo: History of non-healing ___ ulcers and 
MRSA osteo. Appearance of deep wound on right leg concerning for 
probe to bone. L tib/fib xray suggestive of osteo, but ESR not 
significantly elevated. Vascular surgery consulted and did not 
recommend interventions for now. Request arterial studies to r/o 
arterial ulcer, which showed patent bilateral lower extremity 
arterial systems.  

# Hx DVT: On warfarin, presented with supratherapeutic INR 5.5 
which increased to 10. He was reversed with Vit K and restarted 
on home regimen. INR at the time of discharge was 4.0. Goal ___. 
Patient should have his warfarin dose held at on day of 
discharge. Patient should have his INR carefully monitored and 
warfarin dose adjusted accordingly as an outpatient.  

# CAD s/p CABG: On admission, had new TWI in anterior leads and 
troponin elevation. ___ have been poor clearance in setting of 
acute renal failure with flat CKMB. Downtrended and patient 
without chest pain prior to discharge. 

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES
- Patient was started on torsemide 80 mg PO QD for fluid 
overload and pulmonary edema. He should continue this as an 
outpatient and potentially transition back to his home dose of 
furosemide 40 mg PO QD slowly, per outpatient PCP 
___. 
- Due to low/normal BPs during the admission, the patient 
developed ATN. Cr at the time of discharge was 1.6. Cr should be 
monitored as an outpatient, but this could be the patient's new 
baseline. Additionally, tacrolimus dose was increased 1 mg PO 
Q12H. Tactolimus levels should be monitored as an outpatient. 
The patient will need follow-up with Transplant Nephrology 
within ___ months. 
- Patient was noted to be anemic with Hgb < 7.0 during this 
admission. He required 3U pRBC and was started on iron 
supplementation prior to discharge. Please ensure that the 
patient maintains an aggressive bowel regimen to prevent 
complications from the iron. Please check Hct within 1 week to 
ensure stability.  
- Patient was discharged with a foley in place. Tamsulosin was 
restarted at discharge. Patient will require outpatient 
follow-up with Urology for voiding trial. 
- During this admission the patient had ongoing issues with poor 
PO intake, which has been a chronic problem. The issue of 
re-placing the NGT prior to discharge was discussed with both 
the patient and his family, but all were opposed. The patient's 
wife agreed to bring the patient at least one meal per day and 
the patient agreed to try to eat more. 
- At the time of discharge patient is full code, but ongoing 
code status conversations should be had with the patient and his 
family.

multiple DVTs on coumadin, diastolic heart failuire among other 
conditions that presents with confusion, low oxygenation 
saturations, acute renal failure, and relative hypotension 
concerning for sepsis from a urinary source. 
.
Acute diagnoses:
#Sepsis from UTI source: Patient is immunocompromised in setting 
of kidney transplant and presents with leukopenia, hypothermia 
in setting of positive UA/UCx suggestive of sepsis from a 
urinary source. Prior urine culture data suggestive of E. coli 
and Proteus that are resistant to certain drug classes. CXR 
without consolidation.  Host factors include immunosuppresion 
with tacrolimus/prednisone, HCAP exposure. On presentation, pt 
met SIRS criteria, with lactate elevation and ___.  He was 
treated with fluid resuscitation and empiric abx (Vanc/Zosyn).  
MICU COURSE: patient was admitted to the MICU for respiratory 
distress and relative hypotension in setting of Sepsis of 
urinary source and ___ possibly ___ renal transplant failure. Pt 
on vanc/cefepime during MICU adm. Pt had improvement in his 
respiratory status and was hemodynamically stable at the time of 
transfer from the MICU. Transitioned to IV ceftriaxone. Ucx grew 
e coli. Blood cultures were negative. Pt transitioned to PO 
cefpodoxime ___ with plan for 14d course total of ABX to end 
___. 
.
# Dyspnea/hypoxia: Patient is reporting a subacute course of 
dyspnea with acute flare starting on admission with new O2 
requirements. Although immobile, he is low-risk (1.3%) based on 
Wells score. Troponin - and ECG with no acute changes. BNP 
elevated, JVD, volume up on exam. Appears patient was right 
sided volume overloaded and improved with some diuresis. 
Secondary consideration would include diaphragmatic contribution 
given prior RUL resection with volume loss.  TTE with no changes 
from prior.  In MICU, pt did not require ventilatory (invasive 
or non-invasive) assistance. Respiratory status improved and pt 
satting 98-100% RA.
.
# Status post kidney transplant with acute renal failure: Pt's 
allograft function was compromised on admission given recent 
baseline Cr 1.1-1.2, rehab lab on ___ Cr 1.4, and admission 
Cr 1.6. His urine output had been marginal. Admission urinalysis 
showing protein 100 with last UA in ___ showing trace protein. 
FeUrea 20.27, prerenal. UA shows granular casts. He may have 
hypotension that has lead to ATN. Urine eosinophils are negative 
speaking against AIN in setting of mild peripheral eosinophilia. 
Secondary consideration is tacrolimus vasoconstriction also 
contributing to ? ATN picture. Creatinine has downtrended after 
fluid resuscitation. UCx positive as above. Lasix 40mg QD 
restarted ___. Renal ultrasound generally unremarkable
.
# Pressure Ulcers: Multiple pressures ulcers: R lateral tibia 
(full thickness), R heal (originally Stage III), L Lateral foot 
(healing stage III-IV). Wound care consulted and patient treated 
per their recs: Remove pressure from area, constant 
repositioning, waffle boots at all times. He has stage I sacral 
ulcer and multiple areas of skin breakdown in lower extremities. 
Sacral coccygeal area blanchable
.
# Immunosuppression: Continued tacrolimus and prednisone. 
Continued bactrim ppx. Followed daily tac levels with goal 
trough between ___.

# Acute toxic-metabolic encephalopathy: home mirtazapine held; 
vitamin B12, RPR, TSH was elevated however T4 was within normal 
limits. BK virus undetected 
.
# Microcytic, Hypochromic anemia: Admission Hgb is 8.2 (of note 
baseline ~ 10). Fe studies c/w anemia of chronic disease (low 
Fe, low transferrin and TIBC, normal ferritin). Last EGD and 
colonoscopy were in ___ with polyps in the sigmoid colon 
(polypectomy) and mild-moderate gastritis (biopsy).  H/H stable. 
Pt initially on Fe supplementation, but discontinued for iron 
studies that seemed more c/w anemia of chronic disease.
.
# Prolonged QTc and Sinus bradycardia: QTc noted to be 502 ms on 
admission ECG. Resolving bradycardia. On telemetry. Resolved 
(QTc down to 430 and no longer bradycardic).

nutritional deficiency from poor PO intake in the setting of ABX 
use. Patient has a history of difficult to control INR levels. 
No documented dose of coumadin since ___. LFTs WNL. Pt given 5 
mg PO vit K. INR down to 2.4 on day of discharge. Pt to resume

He was prepped, and brought down to the Endo suite room for  
surgery. Intra-operatively, he was closely monitored and  
remained hemodynamically stable. He tolerated the procedure well 
 without any difficulty or complication.

Post-operatively, transferred to the PACU for further  
stabilization and monitoring. 

He was then transferred to the VICU for further recovery. While  
in the VICU he received monitored care. When stable he was 
delined. His diet was advanced.  When he was stabilized from the 
acute setting of post operative care, he was transferred to 
floor status 

On the floor, he remained hemodynamically stable with his pain 
controlled. He continues to make steady progress without any 
incidents. He was discharged home in stable condition.

He did receive preoperative hydration. On DC his creatinine is 
stable. Tacrolimus level stable,
