encephalopathy and hypernatremia at the request of his son, who 
had been concerned that the patient was receiving inadequate 
care at rehab. The patient had had several recent prolonged 
hospitalizations c/b decubitus ulcers and contractures of his 
LUE and LLE. Family meetings were held with the patient's 
son/health care proxy around the patient's goals of care. The 
patient's son voiced understanding of the chronic nature of his 
father's medical conditions (including dementia/cognitive 
decline, wounds, contractures, and inability to maintain PO 
intake) with the decision to transfer the patient to hospice and 
change his code status to DNR/DNI. He was transferred to 
inpatient hospice. 

#Acute-on-chronic encephalopathy

sepsis, most likely ___ Enterobacter UTI in the setting of 
chronic indwelling Foley. He was treated with a 14-day course of 
antibiotics per his goals of care at the time.

#Decubitus ulcers
Patient p/w multiple pressure ulcers ranging from full-thickness 
to unstageable. His foot wounds were evaluated by Podiatry, and 
he underwent CT pelvis and R heel, which did not demonstrate 
osteomyelitis. He was followed by Wound Care. Surgical 
evaluation was deferred.

CHRONIC/RESOLVED ISSUES:
========================
#NSVT
H/o asymptomatic NSVT during his last admission, at which time 
he was initiated on metoprolol.

#Urinary retention s/p chronic indwelling Foley
Patient had been seen by his outpatient urologist PTA with 
recommendation to continue indwelling Foley with changes q4-6 
weeks. Urinary retention thought to be ___ large prostate; 
already on maximal medical therapy. Home tamsulosin and 
finasteride were continued for comfort.

#Normocytic anemia

History of Present Illness:
___ is a ___ male w/ past medical history of HTN, BPH
requiring intermittent foley placement, diverticulosis and DMTII
presenting with  abdominal pain since ___. He feels as
though his abdomen has become more distended. He denies N/V or
diarrhea. No changes to his stool, still having good BMs without
blood or melena. He notes some decreased appetite yesterday due
to his pain, but otherwise denies decreased PO intake. No 
fevers,
chills, cough or dysuria.   

Of note pt has been following w/ atrius urology for his BPH w/
associated urinary retention. He was was recently seen ___ 
when
his foley was removed for a voiding trial. Pt has known enlarged
prostate measured at 290ml by U/S in ___. Per urology, if he
fails this voiding trial he may either need "chronic indwelling
versus surgical simple prostatectomy (though latter may be
difficult given age and comorbidities)". Self-catheterization 
not
an option given visual impairment. Per Atrius records, pt

IMAGING/STUDIES
===============

CT A/P (___) 
IMPRESSION:
1. Small bowel loops are diffusely dilated and fluid-filled.  
The differential
includes ileus and partial small-bowel obstruction, with early 
partial small
bowel obstruction favored with a transition point in the low 
right anterior
abdomen.  No signs worrisome for bowel ischemia within the 
confines of an
unenhanced scan.
2. Unchanged extensive severe atherosclerotic disease with focal 
ectasia of
the infrarenal abdominal aorta and left common iliac artery 
aneurysm with
suggestion of associated chronic dissection.
3. Unchanged incompletely characterized renal lesions, 
statistically cysts and
hemorrhagic or proteinaceous cysts.  As before, nonemergent 
renal ultrasound
is recommended to exclude suspicious lesion.
4. Marked prostatomegaly.
 
CT A/P (___) 
IMPRESSION: 
The study is limited by patient motion.  Within this limitation:
1. Mild bronchial wall thickening within the left lower lobe, 
with
ground-glass opacities of the bilateral lower lobes, may be 
compatible with
aspiration or pneumonia.
2. Possible punctate, nonobstructing renal stones within the 
right kidney.
3. 1.6 cm intermediate density lesion within the upper pole of 
the right
kidney, along with multiple, subcentimeter bilateral hyperdense 
cysts.  A
nonemergent renal ultrasound can be obtained for further 
evaluation.
4. Marked prostatomegaly.
5. Aneurysmal dilatation of the left common iliac artery, 
measuring up to 2.9
cm.
 
TTE (___) 
The left atrial volume index is normal. There is normal left 
ventricular wall thickness with a normalcavity size. There is 
suboptimal image quality to assess regional left ventricular 
function. Overall leftventricular systolic function is normal. 
The visually estimated left ventricular ejection fraction is 
70%.
There is no resting left ventricular outflow tract gradient. 
Mildly dilated right ventricular cavity with normal free wall 
motion. The aortic sinus diameter is normal for gender with 
normal ascending aorta diameter for gender. The aortic arch 
diameter is normal. The aortic valve is not well seen. No masses 
or
vegetations are seen on the aortic valve. Aortic valve stenosis 
is present (not quantified). There is mild [1+] aortic 
regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened 
with no mitral valve prolapse. No masses or vegetations are seen 
on the mitral valve. There is moderate mitral annular 
calcification.
There is mild to moderate [___] mitral regurgitation. Due to 
acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation could 
be UNDERestimated. The tricuspid valve leaflets appear 
structurally normal. No mass/vegetation are seen on the 
tricuspid valve. There is mild to moderate [___] tricuspid 
regurgitation.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There 
is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: No 2D echocardiographic evidence for endocarditis. 
If clinically suggested, theabsence of a discrete vegetation on 
echocardiography does not exclude the diagnosis of endocarditis. 
Suboptimal image quality.

SUMMARY STATEMENT
==================
___ male w/ past medical history of HTN, BPH requiring 
intermittent foley placement, diverticulosis and DMTII 
presenting with abdominal pain, distension and urinary 
retention, found to have ___ ___ obstructive uropathy and 
Aerococcus bacteremia (urinary source). His course was 
complicated by a persistent Ileus requiring NGT placement, 
resolved by the time of discharge.

HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEM 
===========================
ACUTE ISSUES: 
=============

#Aerococcus urinae bacteremia 
#Aerococcus urinae UTI
Patient presented with leukocytosis, abdominal pain, suprapubic 
tenderness, and confusion and was started on broad spectrum 
antibiotics for presumed infection of urinary source. Blood and 
urine cultures grew Aerococcus urinae. A TTE was negative for 
any vegetations. The patient was transitioned to ceftriaxone and 
completed a fourteen day treatment course on ___. 

#Ileus: The patient initially developed large volume bilious 
emesis, and KUB and CT-scan were suggestive of ileus vs SBO. An 
NGT was placed with large bilious output for decompression. 
Surgery was consulted and they recommended medical management 
with aggressive bowel regimen and NGT decompression. Given his 
lack of abdominal surgery, the suspected obstruction was thought 
to be most likely to resolving ileus in the setting of infection 
with possible distal constipation ___ prostatomegaly. However, 
true partial SBO secondary to prostate enlargement was not 
definitively ruled out. The patient improved with an aggressive 
bowel regimen and 5 days of bowel rest, prior to starting tube 
feeds for nutrition. Speech and swallow evaluated him and 
initially cleared him for a dysphagia soft diet, however the 
patient refused to eat the food. His PO intake improved when his 
diet was advanced to regular solids, nectar thick liquids. He 
was kept on tube feeds until the day of discharge, when his NG 
tube was taken out.

___, resolved 
#Obstructive Uropathy ___ severe BPH 
Pt presenting with significant ___ (5.9 on admission from b/l 
1.2) w/ very enlarged prostate on CT A/P here (8.8 x 7.0 x 10.0 
cm with an estimated volume of 322.5) a noted interval increase 
from U/S in ___ estimating volume ~230cc. The patient had been 
undergoing a voiding trial with his outpatient urologist prior 
to admission (started ___. Pt has likely been retaining urine 
since this time, and this obstructive uropathy is the most 
likely cause of his severe ___ (5.9 on admission),especially 
given improvement w/ foley placement. His renal function 
normalized prior to discharge and his foley will likely to be 
continued indefinitely. We continued his finasteride and 
tamsulosin (though the former was held briefly while patient was 
unable to take PO). 

#Urethral erosion
The patient developed mild urethral erosion on ___. Urology 
evaluated him and considered that it represented erosion from 
his chronic Foley. They recommended applying bacitracin ointment 
twice a day. He will have a follow up appointment with Urology 
to assess his need for chronic Foley. 

# Concern for elder abuse
On ___ patient noted that his son ___, had hit him in the 
face several months ago, noting repeatedly that he has "badness" 
in his mind. Additionally there was the concern for financial 
exploitation. Social Work was consulted and contacted Elder 
Services, who appointed a Protective Service Worker (Inestina, 
___ to review his case. They will continue to review 
the case while he's in rehab.

#Hypo/HyperNa 
The patient showed labile sodium the setting of no PO intake and 
resolving ___. He stabilized after IVF, TFs and eventually PO 
intake. His discharge Na was 144. He would benefit from repeat 
electrolytes after discharge.

#Diarrhea
The patient developed diarrhea on ___ which was believed to 
result from chronic tube feeds. A C. difficile was sent which 
was negative. His diarrhea resolved after discontinuing his tube 
feeds.

CHRONIC ISSUES
==============

#HTN
We held his hydrochlorothiazide given his acute kidney injury.

requiring intermittent Foley, recent admission ___ for 
prostatis and R ankle infection s/p hardware infection (on 
levofloxacin/flagyl) presenting with L hip contracture and 
inability to ambulate after discharge from ___ rehab, with 
course c/b mild encephalopathy, NSTEMI/NSVT, and urinary 
retention.

# Inability to ambulate:
# LUE and LLE flexion contractures:
# Chronic myelopathy of C4 on right:
# Encephalopathy in setting of cognitive decline:
# Delirium:
Patient presented with L leg and "whole body" pain with 
inability to ambulate after recent discharge from rehab. On 
exam, LUE and LLE held in flexion. Per son, L arm flexion may be 
chronic, but L leg flexion developed over the last few weeks and 
inability to ambulate is new (confirmed by ___ here, who last saw 
him ___. Mental status was noted to wax and wane, with 
patient intermittently conversant and at other times distressed 
and seemingly confused, likely component of delirium. This has 
occurred in the setting of progressive confusion/behavioral 
changes over the last year per the patient's son. ___ and 
orthopedics were consulted. Etiology of L hip flexion 
contracture remains unclear but was ultimately thought to be 
behavioral given fluctuating exam in the setting of a possible 
neurodegenerative process (in particular, corticobasal 
degeneration or FTD given MRI brain showing global atrophy). No 
e/o acute ischemic infarct on MRI, and EEG c/w encephalopathy
without seizures. NCHCT was negative. TSH, B12, RPR WNL for 
reversible encephalopathy/neuropathy. An isolated MSK etiology 
was thought less likely in the setting of cognitive decline and 
fluctuating exam. MRI C-spine revealed significant degenerative 
changes and likely chronic myelopathic changes on the R at C4, 
unlikely to explain his L-sided findings. CT A/P showed no acute 
pelvic fracture and L femur and L ankle plain films were 
negative. Orthopedics recommended aggressive ___ and knee 
immobilizer in extension (however, patient did not really use 
this).  Patient's exam continued to fluctuate, and he was 
intermittently able to fully extend the leg but not weight-bear. 
 He was treated with Tylenol, lidocaine patch, and low-dose 
baclofen as needed for pain and spasticity.  Because he was 
still an inpatient and scheduled for a ___ clinic 
evaluation on ___, neurology performed a limited 
neuropsych evauation at the bedside, the determination of which 
was that corticobasal degeneration was unlikely, and that 
further assessment as an outpatient was warranted.  He will 
require fall and delirium precautions, and STRONG consideration 
of 24-hour care after discharge from rehab given declining 
functional status at home.

# Chest pain:
# NSTEMI:
# NSVT:
# Severe AS:
Patient developed chest pain and N/V on ___ with new troponin 
elevation 0.09, which peaked at 0.14. Telemetry revealed 
intermittent, brief runs of asymptomatic NSVT. Seen by At___ 
cardiology on ___, who thought presentation more consistent 
with demand ischemia in setting of likely CAD than with ACS 
given character of pain and nl EKG. TTE performed ___ showed 
severe AS ___ <1.0, progressed from moderate AS ___, likely 
contributing to demand ischemia. However, TTE also revealed mild 
apical free wall hypokinesis not reported on TTE ___, 
possibly consistent with a missed MI. He was re-evaluated by 
At___ cardiology on ___ and was not thought to be a candidate 
for TAVR/SAVR or cardiac cath given his poor functional status.  
It was recommended that he follow-up with cardiology as an 
outpatient if his functional status improves for consideration 
of stress testing and possible TAVR. Metoprolol was initiated 
for PVC/NSVT suppression, as was atorvastatin 80mg daily. Home 
aspirin was continued.  Will need cardiology referral through 
his PCP after discharge.

# ___:
# Hyperkalemia:
Cr peaked at 1.5 on ___ from 1.1 on admission with associated 
K 5.5. Likely pre-renal and resolved with IVFs. Home lisinopril 
was held given normotension and can be resumed as needed at 
rehab.  Cr was 1.0 at discharge.

# Normocytic anemia: 
B/l Hgb appears to be ___. Stable without evidence of active
bleeding. Hgb at discharge was 9.3.

# R ankle infection s/p hardware removal:
# Osteomyelitis:
Patient with recent admission for R ankle pain c/f osteo, s/p 
hardware removal ___. Operative cultures isolated CoNS and 
mixed anaerobes. He was initially discharged on 
vanc/cipro/flagyl; however as CoNS isolate resulted susceptible 
to levofloxacin, he was changed to levofloxacin plus 
metronidazole on ___. R ankle unconcerning per ortho. ESR/CRP 
downtrending. Levofloxacin/flagyl were continued, with plan for 
6 week course ___, but ID note from ___ 
suggests continuation through ID f/u with Dr. ___ on ___.  
As the patient was still an inpatient during that appointment, 
in discussion with ID, as he was clinically stable, his 
antibiotics were stopped.  New baseline CRP at the time of 
discharge was 29 (down from ___ at the time of his infection). 


# BPH s/p Foley 
# Prostatitis vs Enterobacter UTI:
Patient recently admitted ___ for fever and was found to 
have a positive UA with Enterobacter isolated in urine culture 
and report of prostate tenderness on exam. He was initially 
treated with cipro, transitioned to levofloxacin (given SSTI as 
above) with plan for 6 week course. UTI this admission showed 
only mixed flora.  Levofloxacin was continued at renal dosing 
given plan for 6-week course ___, but per ID 
recommendations this was continued through ___. Mr. ___ 
failed a voiding trial on ___ and again on ___.  
Urology was consulted and recommended discharge with Foley with 
outpatient voiding trial with Dr. ___ (Atrius) on ___. 
Home tamsulosin 0.4 mg daily and finasteride 5 mg daily were 
continued.

# Urethral ulcer:
# Scrotal ulcerations:
# Unstageable L ischial and coccyx ulcers:
Urethral ulcer is chronic. Scrotal ulcerations and unstageable 
ischial and coccyx ulcers were noted this admission in setting 
of immobility. The nursing wound care team was consulted and 
made recommendations for wound care.  Foley was continued for 
retention as above.  Meticulous attention to skin care will be 
required at the rehab.

CHRONIC/STABLE PROBLEMS:

# HTN: 
Normotensive off home lisinopril and amlodipine, which were held 
at discharge.  

# DMII: 
A1c 5.0. Not on anti-hyperglycemic medications. He was treated 
with a diabetic diet and insulin sliding scale while 
hospitalized.

# Glaucoma:
Continued home eye drops.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
====================

[ ] resume lisinopril and amlodipine as needed
[ ] f/u with outpatient neuropsych evaluation in ___ months
[ ] voiding trial with Dr. ___ ___
[ ] PCP referral to cardiology for consideration of stress test, 
f/u of AS if within goals of care
[ ] If contractures are ultimately determined to be solely 
behavioral in etiology, he may not benefit from baclofen (or 
other interventions, such as botox) to reduce
spasticity and these should be avoided.  
[ ] Meticulous attention to skin care will be required at the 
rehab.

___ is clinically stable for discharge today.  On the 
day of discharge, greater than 30 minutes were spent on the 
planning, coordination, and communication of the discharge plan.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,

It was our pleasure caring for you at ___ 
___.  You were admitted to the hospital for inability 
to walk.  Our neurologists and orthopedic surgeons evaluated 
you, and a thorough workup revealed no clear explanation for 
this.  You are being referred to a neurologist who will continue 
to investigate possible causes, but in the interim it will be 
important to continue aggressive physical therapy at rehab.

While you were here you were noted to have mild injury to your 
heart and were started on a medicine to reduce your heart's 
workload.  You were seen by the heart doctors who recommended 
that you follow-up with them in the clinic after you leave 
rehab.

In addition, your antibiotics for your right ankle infection and 
for prostatitis were stopped after you finished your 6 week 
course.  

Lastly, you were noted to have difficulty urinating and required 
catheter to be placed in your bladder.  You are being discharged 
with this catheter in place and will see Dr. ___ in clinic on 
___ for an attempt at removal.

With best wishes for a speedy recovery,
