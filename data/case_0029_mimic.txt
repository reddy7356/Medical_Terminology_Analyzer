========
IMAGING:
========

___ TTE

 Quantitative biplane left
ventricular ejection fraction is 69 % (normal 54-73%).

IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Mild symmetric left 
ventricular hypertrophy with normal
cavity size and regional/global biventricular systolic function. 
High normal estimated pulmonary
systolic pressure.
Compared with the prior TTE (images reviewed) of ___ , 
the findings are similar(trace aortic
regurgitation now present).

CXR ___

IMPRESSION:  
  
Increased pleural based opacity at the right apex, could 
represent pleural 
thickening/scarring, though not fully characterized.  Consider 
nonemergent CT of the chest to further assess. 

MICROBIOLOGY:
=============

None

 
Brief Hospital Course:
SUMMARY:
=====================
___ with MI, HTN, CHF sent from ___ after being found to be 
in
atrial fibrillation after not taking her Lasix for two weeks 
with
symptoms of 2 weeks of dizziness and fatigue

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
====================
[ ] CXR with increased pleural based opacity at the right apex,
could represent pleural thickening/scarring, though not fully
characterized. Consider nonemergent CT of the chest to further
assess; unfortunately patient has been to many different 
providers in the area so reviewing records is difficult
[ ] Consider spironolactone for long-term management of ___ to 
reduce hospitalizations
[ ] Social issues
Patient has housing approved as of ___ and has many 
questions
about this. However, it is only a 1 bedroom so her daughter may
not be able to stay. Apparently was going to ___ to get
housing approval but was found to be dizzy in ___ which 
prompted
hospitalization. Her 1 bedroom house is in ___. She will 
be returning to a shelter with her daughter in the meantime; 
they attest that they have consistent room and board there.

ACTIVE ISSUES:
==============

# Paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillation
CHADS2VASC = 5. Unknown duration, likely at least a few weeks.
Afib may have been caused by increased atrial stretch from
worsening CHF. Improved with diuresis. Patient with persistent
bradycardia to 50's with several dips to low 40's/high 30's on
Metoprolol. Patient asymptomatic and no evidence of poor
perfusion. Metoprolol succinate was decreased from 25 mg to 12.5 
mg with patient maintaining HR in the ___ afterwards without 
further drops. She had no more evidence of atrial fibrillation 
during her hospitalization.
A TTE revealed:

Rate control: Metoprolol XL 12.5 mg daily
Anticoag: Rivaroxaban 20 mg daily with a large meal

# CHF exacerbation, likely non-ischemic HFpEF
# CAD
___ have been triggered by her UTI or viral URI within the last
month. BNP was 2525 on admission. Received 40 mg IV Lasix x2 
days and then transitioned to 80 mg PO furosemide. A TTE on 
___ showed:

# Dizziness
Generally happens when she is walking around; no chest pain,
nausea, or dyspnea associated. Likely caused by her Afib. EKG 
and troponin in the ED were normal. Other
possibilities include cardiac ischemia or orthostatic 
hypotension, though no
orthostasis on admission or on the first two days of 
hospitalization. She had no further episodes of exertional 
symptoms, so an inpatient ischemic work-up was deferred. No 
further episodes of dizziness during her hospital stay.

CHRONIC ISSUES:

#Code status
Discussed code status with patient and daughter. ___ 
completed.
Patient is full-code. HCP form completed; see chart for full
details. Daughter is HCP.

#Gout
Continue allopurinol
 
Medications on Admission:
