         PRESUMPTIVE IDENTIFICATION. 
 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ PMH alcohol dependance c/b withdrawal seizures and DTs 
presents with ETOH withdrawal.
 
ACUTE ISSUES
# ETOH withdrawal: Patient with complicated withdrawal history 
including seizures. Last drink 2 pm ___. Patient presented to 
___ with nausea, vomiting, inability to tolerate PO. 
Patient given multiple doses of IV ativan and diazepam in ___ 
and subsequently transferred to ___ ___. Upon arrival to the 
medicine floor, patient placed on CIWA protocol with diazepam 10 
mg PO Q4H PRN CIWA > 10. She was given IVF, thiamine, folate. 
Throughout her stay her CIWA scores steadily declined and the 
patient's symptoms greatly improved. No seizure or other acute 
withdrawal issues on this admission. She was seen by social work 
prior to discharge. She plans to re-establish care with her 
outpatient counselor, who has helped her maintain sobriety in 
the past. 

# Metabolic acidosis: Patient presented with elevated AG at 20 
on OSH labs and 21 on ___ admission labs + ketones in urine 
c/w with alcoholic ketoacidosis. Following IVF resuscitation, AG 
closed at 10.

# Alcoholic hepatitis: LFTs elevated on OSH labs with 2:1 
AST:ALT ratio of ~ 300:150. On repeat labs at ___, AST 403 and 
ALT 141. LFT elevation likely secondary to known alcoholic 
hepatitis, which is chronic. ___ score was 10 and ___ 
score was 5; therefore, patient would not likely benefit from 
corticosteroids or pentoxifylline at this time. Patient 
encouraged to abstain from alcohol. Plans to help her in this 
endeavor were discussed prior to discharge with the patient and 
social work. 
 
# Hematuria: Patient states that hematuria started on day of 
hospitalization. She has had this previously during other 
episodes of ETOH withdrawal. On day of discharge, she continued 
to note bloody urine in the AM, which progressively cleared by 
the time she was discharged. Denied dysuria, frequency, or 
suprapubic/abd pain. UA was sent, which showed > 182 RBC, mod 
___, no WBC. Urine culture was also sent, which was pending at 
discharge, but subsequently returned growing > 100,000 E. coli. 
Though this would suggest UTI as cause for hematuria, patient 
was otherwise asymptomatic. Other considerations for hematuria 
included menstrual bleeding, kidney stone, or 
glomerulonephritis. The patient has had issues with DUB, but 
stated that she was fairly certain that this bleeding was, in 
fact, from a urinary source not vaginal. She underwent straight 
cath to allow for discrimination of source of blood, but 
unfortunately, her urine had cleared by that time and repeat 
urine sediment was bland. In terms of possibility of 
nephrolithiasis, she denied any pain, though kidney stone would 
make sense in the setting of dehydration from ETOH withdrawal 
and frequent N/V. Finally, as mentioned earlier, 
glomerulonephritis was a consideration, though Cr not elevated, 
she did not have significant proteinuria, edema, or HTN, and 
hematuria cleared much quicker than what would be 
characteristic. Please continue to work this up further as an 
outpatient. 

# Anemia: Patient with Hgb of 10.9 at discharge with MCV 89. 
Iron studies show ACD/inflammation. B12 and folate replete. No 
evidence of hemolysis, though LDH elevated. Retic count 
suppressed given degree of anemia. Therefore, anemia is most 
likely secondary to marrow suppression in the setting of chronic 
alcohol use. 

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES
- Please monitor and further work-up anemia. Pending at 
discharge: iron studies, B12, folate, haptoglobin, LDH. 
Reticulocyte count low at 1.5. 
- Please work-up question of hematuria further as an outpatient 
and consider cystoscopy, if persists. Patient with bland urine 
sediment by the time her urine was assessed.
- Medications added: MVI, thiamine, folate

 She recently graduated from a women's alcoholic treatment 
program and had been clean for about 3 months. She then again 
resumed drinking vodka one to 2 times daily for the last 4 days 
(last drink ___, she has been drinking on a daily basis. She

acute on chronic anemia with nadir of 8.9 without evidence of 
active bleed. She also had significant lactic acidosis to 13 
with tachypnea and respiratory alkalosis on blood gas. She was 
given IVF, with changes in IVF based on progressive metabolic 
acidosis and hypoglycemia. She was found to have an E.coli UTI 
and was started on ceftriaxone ___. Her coagulopathy was treated

periorbital edema. No frank stridor, but significant upper 
airway secretions. Responded to 50 mg IV Benadryl with improved 
secretions, and periorbital edema  

Had received Ativan magnesium, lactulose and IV albumin since 
arrival, but nothing within a few minutes of this event. Had 
been receiving ativan at ___. Seems like allergic 
reaction/anaphylaxis, but absolutely unclear what the reaction 
was to. Given persistent 1:1 nursing care requirements and need 
for respiratory monitoring, care escalated to ICU.

Brief Hospital Course:
___ with recent diagnosis of multiple sclerosis not on therapy, 
alcoholic hepatitis admitted for ___ 10 initially for acute 
management of alcoholic hepatitis and was transferred to ICU due 
to anaphylactic reaction. 

# Anaphylaxis: Possible culprits included ceftriaxone, albumin, 
ingested foods. Albumin initially appeared most likely given the 
time course of the event. She was administered IV Benadryl, 
Solumedrol, Famotidine, albuterol, and Epi Pen. There was no 
indication for mechanical airway. The patient was transferred to 
the MICU for close observation. She was monitored on telemetry, 
with PRN nebulizers, and stabilized. Antibiotic regimen was 
switched to ciprofloxacin. Allergy was consulted, with 
recommendation: no albumin unless life threatening situation and 
absolutely require it, avoid all cephalosporins. She may take 
other penicillin and other beta lactams if necessary at this 
time. Patient has follow up with Allergy for patch testing. 

# Alcoholic hepatitis: Manifested by AST>ALT liver injury in 
setting of alcohol abuse relapse. Transaminases improved during 
hospitalization, and RUQ U/S was obtained which was negative for 
evidence of portal vein thrombosis or ascites. Liver function 
was monitored, as were coags. She was placed on delirium and 
fall precautions, She was given lactulose for hepatic 
encephalopathy. As DF 19 on presentation, steroids deferred, and 
she was given aggressive nutritional support and LFTs were 
trended until Tbili trended down and was stable x 3 days. Tbili 
on discharge = 4.8. 

# Tachypnea: Tachypnea was attributed to a range of factors, 
including anaphylaxis, lactic acidosis upon presentation, 
alcohol withdrawal, and nicotine withdrawal. VBG showed 
metabolic acidosis and respiratory alkalosis, without evidence 
of respiratory muscle fatigue. Tachypnea improved with treatment 
of the above. 

# Lactic Acidosis: Initial reason for elevated lactate not 
entirely clear, but could be due to UTI and/or volume depletion 
in setting of alcohol abuse and liver injury. Lactate 
downtrended with treatment of the above. 

# Hepatic encephalopathy: Grade I. Ammonia 71 at ___. 
Mental status intermittently confused with very mild asterixis. 
Lactulose 30mL TID was given, with titration to ___ bowel 
movements per day. Electrolytes were repleted as indicated.

# Urinary tract infection: U/A upon presentation was concerning 
for urinary tract infection, with cultures growing E coli. The 
patient was initially started on ceftriaxone, but out of concern 
for anaphylaxis was transitioned to ciprofloxacin (7 day course, 
last day ___. 

# Depression: Patient was maintained on Celexa, which was held 
at ___ in setting of liver injury, administration could 
cause QTc prolongation. Celexa was held while in the ICU.

Transitional Issues
- patient will need blood drawn for Chem10, LFTs, CBC, INR on 
___ and the results sent to ___ ATTN: Dr. ___.
- patient started on lactulose 30 mL BID for grade 1 hepatic 
encephalopathy 
- folic acid for nutritional support. Continue Ensure TID. 
- patient seen by social work w/ discussion re: importance of 
abstaining from alcohol. Please continue this discussion as an

Discharge Instructions:
Dear ___,

It was a pleasure caring for you here at ___ and celebrating 
your birthday with you!

What happened while you were at the hospital?
- You were admitted because of worsening abdominal distention, 
jaundice, nausea, vomiting, unable to eat food, dark urine and 
alcohol withdrawal. 
- Your physical exam showed jaundice and an inflamed liver. Your 
labs were notable for elevated liver enzymes which indicates 
liver injury and inflammation. An abdominal ultrasound was taken 
which showed you have cirrhosis (severe scarring of your liver).
- You were diagnosed with something we call alcoholic hepatitis. 
This is a very serious disease where your liver becomes 
extremely inflamed and your body is susceptible for several 
complications including infection and bleeding. Fortunately, you 
did not suffer from any of the complications of alcoholic 
hepatitis this time. 
- You were treated for your withdrawal symptoms with medication 
and you tolerated the withdrawal well with no seizures and 
minimal symptoms. 
- Prednisone is a medication that may help decrease the 
inflammation of the liver in alcoholic hepatitis, but it also 
lowers the immune system and can worsen an infection if one 
exists. You were worked up for an infection before starting 
prednisone, and a urinary tract infection was found. You were 
treated for 5 days with antibiotics and you were started on 
prednisone. Your liver function tests have improved since 
starting the prednisone. 
 
What to do when you are discharged?
- Continue taking the prednisone. Prednisone is a steroid and 
decreases the immune system which makes the body more 
susceptible to infection. Sometimes, it can also cause weight 
gain, mood changes, thinning of the skin, elevated blood sugars 
and bone weakness. Please be very mindful for possible 
infection, look out for burning while peeing, fevers, chills, 
sweats, abdominal pain, diarrhea, shortness of breath, cough, 
sore throat etc. We will also prescribe you calcium and vitamin 
D to ensure good bone health, an antiacid to protect the lining 
of your stomach from the steroid, and also an antibiotic that 
will prevent pneumonia from a specific bacteria called "PCP" 
that can infect the lungs of people on steroids. 
- Please follow up with your primary care doctor. You will be 
referred to a hepatologist to further manage your alcoholic 
hepatitis and liver cirrhosis. 
- You will require an endoscopy of your esophagus in the next 
few weeks that your hepatologist will arrange. Cirrhosis can 
cause large blood vessels in your esophagus to swell up and 
bleed and it is dangerous. The endoscopy can prevent the 
progression of these vessels and monitor them closely. 
- Please follow up with an outpatient rehab program as discussed 
with social work and please reach out to social work services 
for additional help if you need it.
- If you have trouble sleeping, please take ___ of Melatonin 
(over the counter) before bed time. Please talk to your primary 
care doctor if you still have trouble.  

We are happy you are feeling better and wish you all the best.

Sincerely,
Your ___ team
