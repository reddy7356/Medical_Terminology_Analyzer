___hest:

mucous impaction. Bronchoscopy is recommended for further 
evaluation.
2. Small to moderate-sized pericardial effusion.

could indicate small airway disease or aspiration.
.

aeration of the left upper lobe compared to prior study.
3. Patchy atelectasis in the right upper and lower lobes.

Brief Hospital Course:
___ yo female with h/o bipolar disorder and hypothyroidism who 
presented to OSH with increased lethargy and hypoxemic 
respiratory failure requiring intubation and found to have left 
lung collapse.
.
# Respiratory failure: Bronchoscopy on admission without 
evidence of obstructive lesion. Left lung collapse thought to be 
secondary to consolidative pneumonia with copious secretions. 
Respiratory cultures grew out pansensitive MSSA, and initial 
broad coverage with vanc, zosyn, and levofloxacin pared down to 
zosyn and then to nafcillin. Multiple bronchs done given 
persistent copious sputum with gradual improvememt in purulent 
secretions seen in left lung, pt eventually extubated s 
complication. ___ placed for long-term administration of abx, 
pt recieved total of 14day course, last day: ___. 
.
# Hypothyroidism: Poorly controlled per PCP records with concern 
in past that pt may have been abusing medications for weight 
control. She last filled her prescription for armourthyroid in 
___ per her pharmacy. Here, TSH level was 54 with a free T4 of 
<0.1. Thought to be myxedematous per Endo but not myxedema coma. 
Cortisol level normal. Given synthroid with loading dose of 300, 
then 75mcg IV daily. On the day of discharge pt was transitioned 
to PO synthroid ___ mcg). Most recent TSH was 80 and free T4 
0.73.
.
# Altered mental status: Pt initially responsive only to pain. 
This was thought ___ to untreated hypothyrodism v. polypharmacy 
v. underlying bipolar disorder v severe infection. No h/o 
seizure disorder per OSH records. Utox positive for methadone 
and benzos; pt did receive narcan at OSH. Altered mental status 
persisted on arrival. Started on synthroid per endo recs for 
myxedema. Her home psych meds of topiramate and divalproex were 
restarted, her seroquel, clonazepam, provigil, and zolpidem were 
initally held pending improvement. Seroquel and clonazepam 
subsequently restarted at lower dose per psych recs. Seroquel 
was then d/ced as pt's home psychiatrist confirmed pt was no 
longer on this medication and it appeared to lengthen her QT. As 
pt improved clinically, she went from somnolent to delirious. 
Her delirium improved daily. Hopefully pt will continue to 
improve back to her baseline, though cannot exclude the 
possibility of anoxic brain injury ___ her respiratory status 
prior to admission. Pt was occasionally agitated at night. 
Agitation was treated initially with haldol but because of her 
improving mental status and lengthening QT, this was changed to 
occasional prn ativan 0.5mg which had good effect. Would 
definitely AVOID haldol and seroquel in the future.
. 
# CHEST PAIN: pt had one short episode of chest pain which 
resolved c nitroglycerin. Pt's EKG was found to have 1mm ST 
depression in V3-5 (most prominent in EKGs from ___ at 
9:30am) and pt was ruled out with three sets of negative enzymes 
(trop 0.03, 0.02, 0.02). Pt will follow-up with cardiology as 
outpt to determine the need for stress testing. Pt was started 
on asa 81mg, though cardiology may decide to discontinue.
.
# Ileus: Pt developed large bowel ileus without evidence of 
small bowel obstruction (perhaps ___ hypothyroid?). Placed on 
bowel rest with OG tube to suction with aspiration of feculant 
matter. Resolved after several days with aggressive bowel 
regimen. Pt discharged on reglan which pt should be able to 
discontinue as her hypothyroid resolves.
.
# Metabolic acidosis: Pt c nonanion gap metabolic acidosis, 
likely ___ normal saline. Type 1 or 2 RTA was considered as pt 
was also hypokalemic. However, pt's urine lytes and urine pH 
were not completely consistent with either type of RTA.
.
# Pericardial effusion: TTE showed only small pericardial 
effusion (appeared moderate on chest CT) with no evidence of 
tamponade. Pt did not have elevated pulsus paridoxus.
.
# FEN/SWALLOW EVAL: Pt initially received tube feeds. Speech and 
swallow did a video evaluation which showed some aspiration risk 
so pt was started on thickened liquids and pureed solids. Pt 
should follow up for further evaluation while at rehab.
.
# Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin
.
# Communication: No HCP. Boyfriend ___ ___ H, 
___. Father ___ ___ (currently 
fighting; mother in hospital). Sister ___ in ___ ___ 
H, ___ C. Also has 4 stepbrothers.

Discharge Instructions:
FOR PATIENT:
You were admitted to the hospital because of a very bad 
pneumonia. You initially went to the intensive care unit where 
you had a breathing tube to help you breathe and you received 
antibiotics. You were also found to have very low thyroid 
hormone as you had not been taking your thyroid medicine at 
home. We restarted you on a new thyroid medicine called 
synthroid. You were also started on a cream for yeast infection 
(which you were found to have) and daily aspirin.

We aren't sure what happened right before you came to the 
hospital, and you can't remember either, but it is possible that 
you took too much of one of your medicines or perhaps took 
medicines that had been prescribed for someone else. It is very 
important that you take your medicines exactly as prescribed and 
that you do not take any medicines that were prescribed for 
anyone but you.

We asked you if it was possible that you took extra medicine in 
order to purposefully harm yourself but you assured us that this 
was not the case. If you feel like you are at risk of harming 
yourself in the future please call your psychiatrist or go to 
the emergency room.

Lastly, you developed a short period of chest pain while you 
were in the hospital. We are going to have you see a 
cardiologist and are also starting you on a baby aspirin per 
day. When you see the cardiologist he or she may want to stop 
the aspirin or change your medicines. 

You were seen by swallowing specialists at the hospital and they 
felt that your swallowing may be a little impaired. For now, you 
should drink thickened liquids and eat pureed solids. Your rehab 
will reevaluate your swallowing abilities and hopefully you will 
be able to eat normal food very soon. 

Please call your doctor or return to the hospital if you are 
having  chest pain, shortness of breath, fevers or for any other 
symptoms which are concerning to you.
