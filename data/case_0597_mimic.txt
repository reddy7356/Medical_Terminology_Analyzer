Chief Complaint:
Dysphagia
 
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None
 
History of Present Illness:
___ Year old Male physician with history of ischemic stroke and 
aspiration pneumonia presents to the ED with complaints of 1 day 
of vomiting. He report that on the evening prior to admission he 
vomited right after dinner without preceeding nausea. Overnight 
he states he had some nausea, but was able to take his 
medications with applesauce as usual without vomiting. In the 
morning he noted dysphagia and the inability to swallow his 
secretions.
  
In the ED, initial vitals were T 98.5, HR 60, BP 142/89, satting 
98% RA. CXR showed low lung volumes but no acute process given 
poor study. CT revealed no acute process. The ED was concerned 
about food impaction and consulted GI, who evaluated the patient 
and noted that he does not initiate swallow and then pushes food 
back out likely due to discoordination of swallow reflex. Vitals 
prior to transfer: Temp: 98.8 °F (37.1 °C), Pulse: 60, RR: 17, 
BP: 137/84  

He continues to have difficulty swallowing secretions and 
hadbeen spitting them into a towel but they are slightly more 
controlled by the time I saw him. Due to this he has a dry 
mouth. The dysphagia is intermittent but are fairly often. He 
denies neck or throat pain and doesn't feel any obstruction. His 
wife notes that although he has had swallowing problems in the 
past resulting in aspiration, he has never complained of 
dysphagia.

His initial stroke in ___ was due to a basilar artery 
dissection with hemorrhage which left him with balance issues, 
particularly in turning his head. These were overshadowed by the 
large stroke which left him hemiplegic. He notes that while in 
the ED with neurology, he developed retching when they did a 
pupil exam with a flashlight and asked him to look up.

Brief Hospital Course:
___ PMH ischemic stroke and aspiration PNA admitted to the ___ 
with dysphagia and inability to tolerate oral intake. He was 
evaluated by neurlogy and gastroenterollogy who agreed that his 
presentation is related to rectrudescence of his prior stroke. 
With time, symptoms improved and he was discharged to skilled 
nursing.

ACTIVE ISSUES
============
#Dysphagia - Pt initially demonstrated dysphagia above that of 
his baseline on presentation.  Per his family, there is a 
certain level of dypsphagia at baseline but it progressed to the 
point of inability to swallow secretions.  Etiology remains 
somewhat unclear.  GI felt that it was primarily a 
neurologic/swallowing dysfunction issue and deferred EGD.  MRI 
of the brain showed no evidence of acute pathology.  It was felt 
that these sx were likely recrudescence of a prior stroke ___ to 
hypovolemia vs infection.  However, CXR was negative.  UA 
demonstrated pyuria, and he was treated with cefpodoxime for a 
total of a 14 day course.  The dysphagia had returned to 
baseline by HD 3.  He was scheduled for outpatient GI ___ 
on discharge.

#Jaw Pain - Pt developed excruciating jaw pain on HD 4.  EKG was 
ordered to rule out ACS.  Pt complained of tooth pain but no 
lesion or palpable pain on exam.  Palpable pain was present at 
the superior head of the R SCM.  No nodes or masses appreciated. 
 Re-read of the MRI/CT demonstrated no lesion.  IV morphine and 
viscous lidocaine provided symptomatic relief, and symptoms 
resolved prior to discharge.

#Abd Pain - No evidence of pathology by assessment of LFTs and 
lipase.  Abdominal Film demonstrated constipation.  Pt was 
treated with enema and had bowel movement on last day of 
admission

#Chest Pain - Pt experienced CP and was ruled out for MI with 
trops.  He also received a CTPE which was negative for PE.  The 
chest pain was atypical in nature and resolved with nitro x 2 
and morphine, with no further episodes during his admission.

#UTI - Urine was concerning for infection and cipro was started. 
He was then transitioned to ceftriaxone.  He received 2 days of 
ceftriaxone and will get cefpodoxime for a total of 14 days for 
a complicated UTI. 

CHRONIC ISSUES
# Prior CVA with residual effects - pt continued on coumadin and 
asa on admission.  Was subtherapeutic on coumadin on admission 
but therapeutic on d/c without change in dose.

# Hypertension - continued on losartan while in house

# Chronic ___ edema - unchanged during admission.  Continued on 
lasix while in house.

# Hypothyroidism - continued on levothyroxine while in house.

TRANSITIONAL
# A 5mm pulmonary nodule was seen on CT chest, this will need 6 
month follow up on ___
# Pt will need to ___ with PCP. 
# GI has stated that there is no need for outpatient EGD unless 
sx recur

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,
It was a pleasure caring for you during your recent admission to 
___.  You were admitted because you had difficulty swallowing. 
 There was initial concern for a new stroke.  However, imaging 
ruled this out.  We believe this represented an exacerbation of 
your old stroke symptoms that resolved over time.  There is 
thought that this was brought on by a urinary tract infection.  
We have treated you with IV fluids and abx.  Your symptoms of 
difficulty swallowing have improved.  

Additionally, you had intermittent abdominal pain, leg pain, and 
chest pain.  It was determined that you did not have a heart 
attack or blood clot in the lung.  No abnormalities were seen 
with your liver and pancreas enzymes.  Abdominal imaging showed 
constipation which we treated you with by giving you an enema.

You should ___ with your PCP on discharge.  

Your alprazolam was discontinued.
We are providing you with quetiapine to help you sleep.
We are also sending you home with 10 days of cefpodoxime, an 
antibiotic, to treat your urinary infection.

IMAGING & STUDIES: 
___ CXR (nursing home): Low lung volumes and patient body
habitus limit evaluation. Again seen is a pleural-based mass
superolaterally in the left upper lobe without significant
change. The right lung is clear. The heart and mediastinal
structures are unremarkable. 

Impression: Pleural based mass is concerning for malignancy.
Further evaluation with a contrast-enhanced CT of the thorax is
recommended. 

___ CXR:
1. Unchanged chronic elevation of the bilateral hemidiaphragms,
with chronic atelectasis in the right middle and bilateral lower
lobes. 
2. A focal ovoid densities seen overlying the diaphragms on
lateral view may represent overlying vascular structures and
chronic atelectasis, however a superimposed infection or focal
pulmonary lesion cannot be excluded. 

___ CT A/P:
1. No acute intra-abdominal or pelvic process. 
2. Diverticulosis, with no evidence of acute diverticulitis. 
3. Small fat containing umbilical hernia containing loop of 
small
bowel and fat, without complications. 
4. Subcentimeter hypodensities within the liver, likely biliary
hamartomas or cysts. 2 subcentimeter hyperdense foci in the 
right
lobe of the liver, possibly hemangiomas, incompletely assessed. 
  
___ CTA:
1. No evidence of pulmonary embolism or aortic abnormality. 
2. 3.8 x 2.7 x 3.7 cm mass in the left chest wall, previously
identified as lipoma, now shows significant increase in
peripheral soft tissue component. While this finding may be due
to interval fat necrosis of the lipoma, liposarcoma would be
possible. Recommend non-urgent thoracic consultation. 
3. Unchanged 3 mm right upper lobe lung nodule (series 3; image
53). No follow-up imaging is necessary.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ is a ___ year old gentleman with a
history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation on dabigatran, embolic
CVA resulting in R sided hemiplegia and aphasia, hypertension,
currently being treated for a urinary tract infection who
presents from his nursing home for evaluation of hypotension.  

# Hypotension: Broad differential but likely hypovolemia in
origin given improvement with fluids and holding 
anti-hypertensive agents. Denies any new medication changes. No 
localizing signs of infection. WBC improved, pending cultures. 
Lipoma has been present ___ years without TTP at this time. TTE 
originally showed hypokinesis of inferolateral wall of RV but 
cardiology consult was obtained and did not believe this was 
present (poor images). Trop neg x2. EKG with RBBB no other 
changes. No chest pain and completely asymptomatic. His blood 
pressures improved to systolic 120s-140s with holding 
medications. Attempted to restart losartan 100 and atenolol 
after fluids however BP dropped to ___. Today attempted 
again to restart only atenolol with BP ___ that resolved on 
own to SB ___. Completely asymptomatic. CTA chest was 
negative for PE. No other source of infection. 
- Continue treatment of urinary tract infection as below
- F/u ECHO
- Plan to hold losartan 100 and atenolol 50. Hold Lasix. Plan to 
restart atenolol at smaller dose of 25 mg when sBP is >150. 
Otherwise is controlled. 

# Acute hypoxic respiratory Failure: Currently on 3.5 L what was 
weaned to 98% on 2L. This was further weaned to room air 92%. 
CTA no PE/PNA. Given
fluids in NH and ED (4.5L + 1.5L) but do not appreciate crackles
on exam. ? atelectasis and has improved with IS. BNP elevated 
w/o TTE showing failure.  
- IS, continue to hold Lasix pending BP trend today
- ECHO as above
- Wean 02 as able

# Lipoma - CTA was notable for "3.8 x 2.7 x 3.7 cm mass in the
left chest wall, previously identified as lipoma, now shows
significant increase in peripheral soft tissue component.
Discussed with patient, no TTP, no skin changes. Present ___
years. Pt would not like to pursue biopsy at this time so will

Discharge Instructions:
Mr. ___,

You were admitted to the hospital due to hypotension. After an 
extensive workup, we do believe the hypotension was from a 
combination of your blood pressure medications and hypovolemia. 
An echocardiogram was performed of your heart which originally 
showed poor movement, but after reviewed by cardiology was deems 
intact and just poor imaging. We have stopped your losartan 
completely and would recommend you just take atenolol 50 mg 
daily with holding parameters of SBP <100. after we attempted 
this your blood pressure dropped to ___. Since you are 
hypovolemic it would be best to hold all of your blood pressure 
medications until your SBP is >150, then restart atenolol at a 
low dose or 25 mg po qdaily with close monitoring at your 
facility.

Your CT scan showed a possible lipoma necrosis on your chest 
wall but you did not show any signs of infection. Since this has 
been present for ___ years the plan is to monitor.
 
Followup Instructions:
___
