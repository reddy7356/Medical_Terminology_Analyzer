Calcium-8.0* Phos-2.6* Mg-2.___ y/o male seen by Dr ___ as transfer from ___ where he 
had been given diagnosis of unresectable gall bladder CA.
He had a CT done on day before admission which showed:
1. Fluid collection in the gallbladder fossa with extension of 
this fluid immediately surrounding the left hepatic lobe.
2. Mild intrahepatic biliary dilatation. 
3. Prominent portal lymph nodes and omental nodularity as
described. Given the surgical history of positive lymph nodes at
surgery, these are likely metastatic. 
4. 9 mm cystic lesion in uncinate process. Differential 
diagnosis
includes side branch IPMN versus small pseudocyst. 
He underwent CT guided drainage of the fluid collection and 
approximately 120 mL of yellow colored cloudy fluid was 
obtained, consistent with bile. An 8 ___ pigtail catheter was 
placed and significant fluid was drained until 4 days post 
placement, and when repeat CT demonstrated collapse and full 
drainage of that area, the drain was pulled prior to discharge.
On ___ the patient underwent an ERCP. This showed a single long 
and narrow stricture of malignant appearance that was 5 cm long 
was seen at the main duct, common hepatic duct, left main 
hepatic duct and right main hepatic duct. There was mild 
post-obstructive dilation of the intrahepatic branches. These 
findings are compatible with malignant biliary stricture. No 
further contrast was injected to evaluate for a bile leak given 
the narrow diameter of the stricture and conern for cholangitis. 
A sphincterotomy was performed in the 12 o'clock position using 
a sphincterotome over an existing guidewire. An uncovered metal 
60mm by 8mm WallFlex biliary stent (LOT# ___, REF# ___ 
was placed successfully across the bile duct stricture into an 
intrahepatic branch. 
The patient toleratd the procedure without complication. He 
received ___ antibiotics and continued some Unasyn as 
the bile culture from the drain placement grew gram positive 
cocci. This was d/c'd prior to discharge, but he was started on 
PO Cipro and ursodiol.
The patient will be set up with outpatient heme-onc.
He was tolerating diet, ambulating and had bowel function. His 
jaundice was markedly improved upon discharge.

.
CTA Torso ___: 1. New right-sided notable renal pelvic 
fullness with hydroureter extending to the pelvis. Area of high 
attenuation at transition point, is concerning for obstruction 
possibly due to metastases, although noncontrast studies are not 
available to evaluate for possibility of a previously 
unidentified ureteral calculi (less likely). Could be further 
evaluated with dedicated CTU study. 
2. Concentric thickening of esophagus may reflect esophagitis, 
possibly 
infectious given likely immunosupressed state or possibly 
secondary to reflux. Could be further evaluated with esophagram. 

3. Stomach wall thickening with ulceration noted in greater 
curvature, may be malignant in nature. Consider endoscopy, if 
indicated. 
4. Increased dilatation of the duodenum proximal to the SMA. 
Given dramatic weight loss in the last year, the patient is at 
increase risk of SMA syndrome or a functional obstruction. Could 
be further evaluated with UGI study. 
5. New 1cm hypoattenuation in right hepatic lobe concerning for 
malignancy. 
6. Unchanged soft tissue density surrounding and within common 
bile extent 
suggestive of occlusion. 
7. Increased size of left pleural effusion with worsening lobar 
collapse.
.
MRI lumbar spine ___
Widespread metastatic infiltrative bone disease involving the 
lumbar spine, sacrum, and visualized lower T11 and 12 vertebral 
bodies without
evidence of thecal compression or neural compromise. Metastasis 
at the L5
vertebral body is increased, almost involving 80% of the L5 
body.
. 
Mild anterior wedge compression of the L1 vertebral body.

CXR ___: IMPRESSION: 
1. NG tube ending at the GE junction with the side port in the 
mid-to-distal esophagus. Recommend advancing the NG tube by 
between 10-15 cm. (After this CXR, NGT was advanced 15cm) 
2. Moderate right pleural effusion is slightly decreased. Small 
left pleural effusion is unchanged.    
3. Unchanged minimal bibasilar atelectasis. 

EGD ___: Impression: Esophagitis at the GE junction
Gastritis with edema and thickened gastric folds suggesting 
extrinsic compression but cannot exclude tumor infiltration 
(biopsy)
Duodenitis of the bulb and ___ part of the duodenum
Deformity due to extrinsic compression of the duodenal bulb and 
second part of the duodenum
Otherwise normal EGD to second part of the duodenum 
Recommendations: The findings account for the symptoms
Await pathology results
Extrinsic compression at the duodenum is not amenable to 
duodenal stenting
Further management per inpatient team 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ yo M with Stage IV Gallbladder CA diagnosed in ___ most 
recently treated with FOLFIRI (cycle 4 on ___ who presented 
to ED with fever to 103, weakness, and hypotension
.
# Hypotension: On admission to the FICU, patient was hypotensive 
to 91/60 and was on his 5th liter of IVNS. He was treated with 
IV fluid boluses and pressors were not requried. His blood 
pressure normalized within the first 6 hours of his ICU stay. 
Hypotension is attributed to hypovolemia from vomiting and poor 
oral intake in addition to gram negative sepsis, and resolved 
prior to transfer to the oncology medicine floor.
.
# Fever: Blood cultures drawin in the ED on arrival rapidly 
returned with gram negative rods in one of two bottles. Patient 
was treated empirically with meropenem and vancomycin for 
presumed intrabdominal source of infection related to bacterial 
translocation from small bowel obsruction. Other sources 
considered were pneumonia, urinary given hydronephrosis on 
imaging, biliary with hx of biliary sepsis in ___ and 
obstruction of biliary drain.  His BCx grew out enterobacter 
that was cipro sensitive.  Patient started on cipro for a 14 day 
total course.  He went home with IV ABx to complete this course 
per request of his wife.  Therefore, he went home on ___ with a 
bridge to hospice care. 
.
# Incomplete small bowel obstruction. CT abdomen on arrival was 
concerning for SMA syndrome vs obstruction related to metastatic 
disease vs functional obstruction. A nasogastric tube was placed 
with large volume of bileous fluid returned and improvement in 
symptoms. General surgery was consulted to place a venting 
gastric tube. He was identified as high risk for surgical 
intervention given comorbid metastatic gall bladder cancer and 
the location of the transition point close to the stomach 
limiting surgical approach. Gastroenterology was consulted to 
place a duodenal stent however SMA syndrome is an absolute 
contrindication to duodenal stent placement. The NGT was clamped 
to monitor progoression of symptoms and the patient shortly 
developed nausea and abdominal pain and NGT was returned to 
suction.  He was seen by GI after he was transferred to the 
oncology medicine floor, and an EGD was done on ___ which 
showed he was not a duodenal stent candidate.  Biopsies were 
taken that showed gastric mucosa with inflammation.  He was sent 
home on hospice with an NGT, with a suction device and ___ 
bridge to hospice for management. Because of NGT, patient is 
unable to take pills, so his medications were transitioned to 
liquid or dissolving at dispo.
.
# Transaminitis: LFTs and t.bili were mildly elevated on 
admission and fluctuated throughout ICU course. Prior CT 
revealed obstructed metallic stent. He did not endorse RUQ pain 
to suggest cholangiitis. Elevated LFTs are attributed to 
impaired drainage from biliary stent and progression of gall 
bladder cancer.  Once it was determined that patient would go 
home on hospice, we stopped taking his labs, so it is unclear 
how this had progressed on the day of dispo.
.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___, 

You were admitted to ___ for the evaluation and treatment of 
your fever.  When you were admitted we found that there was 
bacteria in your blood.  We treated you with antibiotics and you 
began to feel better.  Because our laboratory examination showed 
that your liver and bile system were likely blocked, we had you 
undergo an ERCP procedure.  During this procedure they were able 
to relieve the blockage.  You tolerated this procedure well with 
no complications, and did well in the recovery period.  You were 
then deemed safe for discharge on oral antibiotic medicines.
