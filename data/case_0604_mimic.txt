Attending: ___.
 
Chief Complaint:
Agitation, UTI
 
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

 
History of Present Illness:
___ year old female with history of atrial fibrillation not on 
anticoagulation, CHF, ovarian cancer s/p TAH/BSO and 
chemotherapy who was brought to the ED by family for agitation. 
Per report, the patient has not been acting herself and has 
become more agitated and aggressive. She has been refusing 
medications, has not bathed, and has been throwing knives. She 
was diagnosed with a urinary tract infection one day prior to 
admission and was prescribed ciprofloxacin. However, per report 
patient has not been taking medications.

Collateral information from her grandson includes that patient 
was independent until 1 month ago when she fell trying to get 
her husband breakfast. Afterwards, she was in rehab for one 
month. She was discharged home on ___. Patient has since had 
24 hour care with ___ providing 10 hours during the day and 
son/grandson alternating care in the evenings. 

The patient was subsequently admitted to ___ from ___ 
for hypoxia which was attributed to CHF and aspiration. 
Hospitalization was complicated by anemia and atrial 
fibrillation with RVR. Anemia was attributed to slow GI bleed 
and CKD. Patient deferred EGD/colonoscopy and was transfused 
RBCs. Patient was evaluated by speech and swallow with overt 
aspiration. The patient and family deferred dysphagia workup and 
did not want a feeding tube. She was continued on an oral diet 
with, understanding the risks of aspiration. Goals of care were 
discussed with the patient and family and it was confirmed 
DNR/DNI. Patient was discharged with home hospice services and 
home health aid for nearly 24 hour assistance. 

Grandson notes that patient has had significant behavioral 
symptoms especially over the last 7 days. Her PCP prescribed 
ciprofloxacin prophylactically for UTI but patient refused to 
take it. PCP actually came and visited her in the home and 
convinced her to take one tablet. Otherwise, patient has refused 
all medications over the last week.  Of note, grandson asked PCP 
to fill out forms that would allow him to make decisions for her 
- PCP stated he did not feel comfortable doing this and wanted 
formal evaluation by psychiatry. 

Yesterday evening, patient was noted to be despondent and 
screaming at everyone. Grandson subsequently called ___. Patient 
was reportedly hitting people with canes and trying to throw 
things in the kitchen, ?
?throwing knives. 

In the ED, initial VS were T 98.9, HR 94, BP 186/58, RR 20, 100% 
RA. Patient was agitated and placed in soft restraints. She 
received olanzapine 5 mg IM x1 and was calm following 
intervention.
- Labs: WBC 13.1, H/H 8.6/27.1, Cr 1.6 (baseline). UA negative 
leukocytes/nitrites. 
- CXR was deferred due to agitation.   
Vitals on transfer: 101 116/75 18 99% RA 

Upon arrival to the floor, patient was extremely upset with her 
family for bringing her to the hospital. She denied any pain or 
discomfort. She declined vital signs and declined to be 
examined.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ is a ___ year old female with history of atrial 
fibrillation, aspiration, CHF, and CKD who was brought to the ED 
by family for agitation.

# Agitation: Patient had been refusing medications, has not 
bathed, and had been throwing things per family members. UA on 
admission not consistent with UTI. Patient also with 
leukocytosis, however this has persisted since her last 
hospitalization. Patient does have a history of aspiration but 
was without cough and found to have CXR with no evidence of 
focal consolidation. EKG was without ischemic changes. On 
further history, it seems that patient is more demoralized and 
upset by the lack of independence that she has at home. She is 
oriented x 3 and converses appropriately when examined. ___ 
evaluated her and recommended 24 home supervision. Patient was 
evaluated by psychiatry who agreed that patient was not 
depressed or delirious but rather simply frustrated by home 
situation. 

# Disposition: Patient had prolonged hospitalization as 24 hour 
home supervision could not be provided. She was evaluated by 
social work and palliative care as well as geriatrics. She was 
determined to have capacity and thus, her own medical 
decision-making. Despite her wishes to go home without 24 hour 
supervision, she was held in order for this care to be 
established to provide a safe discharge plan. Multiple family 
meetings were held with primary care taker, grandson ___, 
primary team members, social work, and others. Ultimately, with 
geriatrics and hospice liaison presence and aid, a plan for 24 
hour supervision was instituted and thus, patient was deemed 
safe for discharge home with services.

# Leukocytosis: Persistently elevated from last admission. This 
was attributed to continued aspiration. Decreased to 8.0 on 
___.

CHRONIC ISSUES:
# HYPERTENSION: Continued home amlodipine, metoprolol.
# CHF: Currently not symptomatic and on room air. Of note, the 
patient was discharged home on O2 at last admission. Continued 
home Lasix 20mg PO daily.
# AFIB: Not on anticoagulation. Continued on fractionated 
metoprolol while hospitalized and discharged on long-acting 
metoprolol. 
# Anemia: Likely secondary to slow GI bleed and CKD. Patient 
required transfusions during last hospitalization but declined 
further intervention or workup with egd/colonoscopy. H/H 
remained stable during this admission. 

# CODE STATUS: DNR/DNI
# CONTACT: Grandson ___: ___ (power of attorney), Son 
___: ___

# TRANSITIONAL ISSUES
- hospice ___ services to continue support at home
- consider Seroquel or another antipsychotic to help with 
behavior issues

========
EKG:
========
___: Sinus rhythm. Left axis deviation with left anterior 
fascicular block. No changes from previous ___. 

========
IMAGES:
========
___ RUQ U/S: No evidence of ascites or free intraperitoneal 
fluid. Status post cholecystectomy. Stable, mild CBD dilation up 
to 1.0 cm.

___ XR L LEG: No acute fracture or dislocation. Status post 
left knee arthroplasty w/o evidence for hardware complication. 

___ ECHO: Left atrium is normal in size. No atrial septal 
defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall 
thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic function are 
normal (LVEF >55%). The estimated cardiac index is high 
(>4.0L/min/m2). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased 
left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). No mid-cavitary 
gradient is identified. Right ventricular chamber size and free 
wall motion are normal. The diameters of aorta at the sinus, 
ascending and arch levels are normal. There are three aortic 
valve leaflets. The aortic valve leaflets are moderately 
thickened/ calcific. There is no aortic valve stenosis. No 
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are 
moderately thickened. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due 
to acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation may 
be significantly UNDERestimated.] The tricuspid valve leaflets 
are mildly thickened. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic 
hypertension. The pulmonic valve leaflets are thickened. There 
is no pericardial effusion.

___ L FOREARM: Impacted fracture of the distal radius at the 
metaphysis. Equivocal intraarticular extension. Dorsal tilting 
of the radial articular surface. Surrounding soft tissue 
swelling. Overall demineralization. Baseline degenerative 
changes of the first CMC and first MCP joint. 

___ CAROTID DOPPLER: Other than mild heterogeneous plaque in 
the proximal left internal carotid artery, no hemodynamically 
significant stenosis noted on either side. 

___ CT CHEST/ABD/PELVIS: No solid organ injury. Nondisplaced 
fractures of the posterior right ninth and tenth ribs. Moderate 
intra and extrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation is incidentally 

noted. The common bile duct measures 15 mm. No pancreatic ductal 
dilatation. Suggestive of underlying sphincter of Oddi 
dysfunction or ampullary stenosis. Correlate with LFTs and 
consider ERCP on a nonurgent basis. 1.7 cm ground-glass opacity 
in the right lower lobe, possibly inflammatory, and 4 mm left 
lower lobe nodule. Followup non-contrast CT chest is recommended 
in 6 months.  1 cm nodule in the right lobe of the thyroid. 
Correlate with TSH levels and with any prior OSH thyroid 
imaging. 

___ CT SPINE: No evidence of fracture. Mild degenerative 
anterior subluxation of C7 on T1. Alignment is otherwise normal. 
Multilevel degenerative disc disease. 

___ CXR: Lungs are clear. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax. 
Normal cardiomediastinal silhouette. Multilevel degenerative 
changes throughout the thoracolumbar spine. 

___ XR PELVIS: No fracture or dislocation.  There are 
moderate degenerative changes bilaterally in the hip joints.  
Muscular calcifiations are better shown on same day CT. 

___ CT HEAD: No intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect. Large 
frontoparietal subgaleal scalp hematoma. No fracture. 
 
Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. ___ is a pleasant ___ woman with a history of 
hypertension, chronic kidney disease, esophagitis, ovarian 
canncer s/p resection and chemo therapy who presented with a 
scalp laceration, posterior rib fractures and left distal radius 
fracture to a mechanical fall down stairs.  

======================
ACTIVE ISSUES:
====================== 
# Mechanical Fall w/fractures:  Patient had multiple imaging 
studies done in ED to rule out any intracranial bleed and 
orthopedic injuries.  She was noted to have a scalp laceration 
which was sutured closed as well as a left distal radius 
fracture which was reduced by Orthoedic Surgery and splinted.  
She was additionally noted to have multiple posterior rib 
fractures.  Patient was initially admitted to the acute care 
surgery service for further monitoring and a syncope work up was 
initiated.  She had an ECHO which showed preserved EF and 
moderate AS.  Carotid dopplers demonstrated no significant 
stenosis.  EKG was unrevealing.  Patient was monitored on 
telemetry throughout hospitalization without any arrhythmias 
detected.  Given the history of two falls in setting of broken 
mechanical chair and carpeted stairwell, the fall was thought to 
be most likely mechanical in nature.  Patient was seen by ___ who 
thought she would benefit from home physical therapy.  Her left 
arm remained splinted.  Pain control was achieved with Tylenol 
and Tramadol and incentive spirometry was encouraged in setting 
of rib fractures to prevent atalectasis.

# Acute blood loss anemia: Pt presented with H/H of ___ on 
___. H/H dropped to 7.3/23.5 on ___ on ___. She was 
transfused with 1u pRBCs with appropriate bump in H/H. Pt with 
h/o chronic anemia with a baseline HCT of ___ since ___ (per 
PCP). She has refused workup of her anemia in the past. Her PCP 
suspects her chronic anemia is likely related to her long h/o 
esophagitis. The etiology of her acute drop in H/H is unclear 
though she had numerous ecchymoses on presentation and a scalp 
laceration that continued to ooze for >24 hours. Pt was taking 
increased amounts of Aspirin/Alleve for migraines and arthritis 
prior to admission and she was guaiac positive (w/ brown 
stool)--increasing suspicion for a possible slow GI bleed. Retic 
count inappropriately low. GI was consulted who did not think 
that the H/H drop was ___ related to GI bleed and recommended 
deferring Endoscopy/Colonoscopy at this time.  She was started 
on PPI IV initially and transitioned to PO Pantoprazole at 
discharge given her history of Aspirin/NSAID use.  She 
additionally had a RUQ U/S to rule out any free fluid in the

Mild 
cardiomegaly is similar compared to prior.  No acute osseous 
abnormalities. 

IMPRESSION: Bilateral pleural effusions with adjacent 
atelectasis. 

Renal US ___
Of note, there is a pleural effusion in the right lung base. The 
right kidney measures 9.2 cm. The left kidney measures 8.2 cm. 
There is no 
hydronephrosis, stones, or masses bilaterally.  Normal cortical 
echogenicity and corticomedullary differentiation are seen 
bilaterally. 
The bladder is moderately well distended and normal in 
appearance. 
IMPRESSION:  
Right lung base pleural effusion.  Normal renal ultrasound. 

CXR ___
IMPRESSION:  
Moderate to large bilateral pleural effusions are larger, mild 
to moderate 
pulmonary edema and moderate to severe cardiomegaly are worse, 
all compared to ___.  No pneumothorax. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ y/o female with a PMHx of HTN, ovarian CA s/p resection + 
chemotherapy, and ?CHF who presented with cough, new oxygen 
requirement and lower extremity swelling concerning for CHF 
exacerbation, with hypoxia in setting of anemia and aspiration 
who developed paroxysmal atrial fibrillation during admission. 

# Aspiration. 
# Dysphagia: 
She was noted to be coughing on admission with eating and 
drinking. Speech and Swallow evaluation on ___ showed overt 
aspiration with all consistencies, without improvement in 
modifications or techniques. During admission, it was noted that 
the patient looked clinically worse whenever she was eating, 
with increased coughing and difficulty breathing, suggesting 
overt aspiration with liquids and solids consistently. She 
improved when not eating or drinking. The patient and family 
deferred any further dysphagia work up and did not want feeding 
tubes. She was continued on a mechanical soft diet, 
understanding the risks of aspiration. She was treated with 5 
days of Levofloxacin for initial concern of CPAP and 8 days of 
Augmentin for aspiration pneumonia/pneumonitis (course to 
complete ___ 

# Paroxysmal AFib, with RVR. 
Sinus Rhythm on admission, without any prior history of atrial 
fibrillation. She developed Afib, with RVR, which was managed 
with IV metoprolol and starting PO metoprolol. During RVR, she 
experienced associated chest discomfort with mild troponin 
elevation (0.10), likely due to demand ischemia, which improved 
with conversion back to NSR. She converted back and forth 
between NSR and Afib for several days, with pauses (longest 10 
seconds) occurring at time of conversion between Afib and NSR. 
She was asymptomatic during these pauses. RVR episodes seemed to 
occur shortly after eating, suggesting that brief hypoxic 
episodes associated with aspiration were inciting events. She 
was continued on metoprolol succinate 100mg PO daily and was 
discharged in NSR with HR in the ___. Although she had a 
CHADS 3, therapeutic anticoagulation was deferred due to high 
fall risk, anemia and recent h/o guaiac positive stool. 
Furthermore, anticoagulation was not within the patients goals 
of care. 

# Anemia. 
Chronic, normocytic anemia likely acute blood loss anemia on 
chronic anemia of chronic disease. Iron studies and B12 studies 
wnl. Stools were guiac positive and dark consistent with UGI 
bleeding source. Her anemia was likely a combination of slow GIB 
with anemia of chronic disease (CKD). She received 2 units pRBC 
for Hgb <7. We discussed the possibility of endoscopy/colonscopy 
with both the patient and her grandson and they both deferred 
further testing at this time, understanding that her anemia 
would likely persist. She was started on PPI BID while inpatient 
and continued on PPI qd on discharge. Ultimately patient 
discharged home with hospice care.

# Leukocytosis. She had a WBC count persistently stable around 
13 during admission, with negative blood and urine cultures. She 
was treated for possible CAP with Levofloxacin and Augmentin for 
presumed aspiration pneumonia/pneumonitis. She had persistent 
diarrhea but C diff was negative. Much of her WBC elevation was 
thought to be due to continued aspiration events, with 
contributions from stress response from Afib with RVR episodes. 
She was never febrile.

# Acute diastolic CHF exacerbation. LVEF >55%. She was volume 
overloaded on admission with BNP 11,102. Last TTE from ___ 
showed preserved LV and RV function. Repeat TTE was not done 
during admission as it would not have changed management. She 
was diuresed with 10mg IV Lasix qd for several days with 
decrease in Cr. Interval CXR showed continued volume overload, 
likely due to mild flash pulmonary edema from episodes of Afib 
with RVR. She was discharged on 20mg PO Lasix. She required 3L 
NC o2 at all times during admission and was discharged with home 
o2. 

# Acute renal failure. 
Cr elevated at 2.4 on admission and downtrended to 1.7. Etiology 
was likely mixed prerenal and intrarenal from CHF and subacute 
renal hypoperfusion leading to element of ATN. Renal ultrasound 
was normal. ACE-I was held and not continued on discharge. 

# HTN. Home atenolol and ace-i were held on admission. Home 
amlodipine was continued and metoprolol was added (as above for 
Afib) in place of atenolol. ACE-I was not restarted on discharge 
given normotension and elevated Cr.  

# GERD. Home famotidine was switched to pantoprazle.

# GOC. We had many goals of care discussion with ___ and ___ 
HCP, grandson ___. Her code status was confirmed DNR/DNI. 
___ stated her goals to return home to be with her husband and 
family, understanding that she was at risk for continued 
aspiration, blood loss from her GI tract and further episodes of 
Afib with RVR. She preferred to be treated symptomatically, 
rather than pursuing further work-up for these issues. She was 
discharged with home hospice services in addition to home health 
aid services already in place, for nearly 24 hour assistance. ___ 
recommended continued home ___ and agreed to with discharge to 
home given services in place. 

*** Transitional Issues *** 

- Discharged to home with hospice 
- New oxygen requirement 3L NC, discharged home with oxygen 
- Mechanical soft diet (no change in level of aspiration with 
any consistency when evaluated by nutrition) 
- To complete 8 day course of Augmentin for aspiration pneumonia 
on ___
- Started loperamide for frequent diarrhea (C. diff negative, 
guiac positive) 
- Added metoprolol succinate 100mg qd for Afib
- Held home ACE-I in setting of Cr elevation and normotension. 
Consider restarting as an outpatient pending ambulatory blood 
pressures.
