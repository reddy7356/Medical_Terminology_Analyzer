left breast cancer s/p mastectomy and lat flap reconstruction
 
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
1. Left total skin-sparing mastectomy, ___.
2. Left breast reconstruction (latissimus flap with gel

History of Present Illness:
This is an invasive ductal carcinoma, grade 2, with associated
high-grade ductal carcinoma in situ.  The tumor is estrogen and
progestin receptor positive, HER-2/neu not amplified, ratio 0.6. 

This had presented as a new left breast mass noted by Ms.
___.  At the time of her initial presentation, her clinical
exam was remarkable for on the  left breast, "well-healed
surgical scars consistent with reduction mammoplasty.  There was
mild concavity deep to the scar in the inferior breast. Just
medial to this, there is an approximately 3-4 cm linear firm 
area
likely consistent with post-surgical change and fat necrosis."
Same day unilateral diagnostic mammogram and ultrasound of the
left breast demonstrated Calcifications and expected
post-surgical scarring and fat necrosis, corresponding to the
area of palpable abnormality in the lower central left breast. 
Incidental 0.3 cm probably benign isoechoic nodule at 6 o'clock,
1-2 cm from the nipple.  Six month followup left mammogram and
left breast ultrasound is recommended. 

Ms ___ opted for ultrasound core biopsy of the 0.3 cm 
nodule,
which was performed ___, and positive for cancer. 
 
Ms. ___ sought a second opinion at ___ and
underwent a mammogram on ___, which showed
postoperative changes from a prior biopsy and reduction
mammoplasty.

mass at the 4 o'clock position, 4-5 cm from the nipple.

On ___, Ms. ___ underwent an ultrasound core biopsy of
the mass at the 4 o'clock position, which demonstrated fat
necrosis and stromal fibrosis on it only.

Dr. ___ wire localized open surgical biopsies

node
biopsy.  Separate specimens were taken
as well as medial margin, lateral lesion and medial lesion.  She
was found to have microinvasive ductal carcinoma extending into
the anterior margin and ductal carcinoma in situ with fat
necrosis was also noted. Zero of 4 sentinel nodes were positive
for metastatic disease. 

She then returned to ___ and sought an opinion
from Dr. ___.

both the initial biopsy back in ___ (at ___  and the
surgery perfomed by Dr. ___ was concluded that the
