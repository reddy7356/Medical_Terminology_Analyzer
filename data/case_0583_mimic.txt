Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. ___ is a ___ year old pregnant woman at 6 weeks EGA by 
IVF with a past medical history significant for asthma admitted 
on ___ for fever, cough, and dyspnea felt to be due to CAP, but 
found to have eosinophilic pneumonitis.

# Eosinophilic pneumonitis: Patient's A-a gradient was >180 with 
potential etiologies including V/Q mismatch, diffusion 
abnormality, or shunt.  Given absolute eosinophilic count of 
>3000, fever, and acute shortness of breath, the diagnosis of 
acute eosinophilic pneumonia was presumptively made.  She was 
treated with solumedrol 125 Q6H with improvement in symptoms and 
rapid weaning of supplemental oxygen to room air.  She was also 
covered for pneumonia initially with vancomycin and 
levofloxacin, but the regimen was narrowed to a 5 day course of 
azithromycin, which she completed while hospitalized.  She was 
also initially treated with oseltamavir, which was discontinued 
after Influenza DFA returned negative.  Patient was transitioned 
to prednisone 60 mg daily, and she will continue this dose until 
follow-up with Dr. ___ as an outpatient.  Her 
eosinophilic pneumonitis was felt to be secondary to IM 
progesterone in sesame oil suspension, and progesterone was 
changed to intravaginal preparation.  She will require PCP 
prophylaxis if steroid course continues for longer than 1 month, 
and this will be determined as an outpatient.

# Pregnancy: Intravaginal fetal u/s performed during MICU course 
demonstrating viable fetus. OB consulted on the patient, and 
___ was also consulted for blood glucose control (see below). 
 She will continue intravaginal progesterone as above, and 
follow-up with OB/Gyn.

# Hyperglycemia: elevated FSBG in the setting of steroid use.  
Patient was started on sliding scale insulin per ___ recs for 
goal fingerstick <130 at one hour post-prandial.  She will 
continue insulin at home and f/u with the Diabetes in Pregnancy 
Center at ___.

# Asthma: Continued on nebs during admission.
