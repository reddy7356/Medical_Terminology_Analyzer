History of Present Illness:
Ms. ___ is a ___ y/o woman with Asthma, morbid obesity, and 
multiple joint replacements ___ DJD with associated chronic ___ 
skin changes, presenting for acute-on-chronic ___ swelling and 
erythema.

The patient states that about 6 days prior to presentation, she 
began feeling weakness and fatigue with chills and fevers up to 
___. She had some nausea as well and noticed increasing 
swelling as well as erythyma in her b/l ___. She does endorse 
warmth, erythema, and pain first in the LLE and subsequently 
developing in the RLE. She also notes some increased DOE during 
this period (none prior) as well as possible weight gain in 
recent months (although she attributes much of this to 
inactivity ___ knee replacement). She has not had any PND, 
orthopnea, or history of heart failure/heart disease.

She called her PCP 3 day prior to admission and was placed on 
cephalexin therapy, with near immediate resolution in her fevers 
and other constitutional symptoms. Her ___ swelling and redness, 
however, persisted, prompting her to present to the ___ 
ED. Of note, the patient has had multiple acupuncture treatments 
in b/l knees, most recently about 1 week prior to admission.

In the OSH ED, the patient did have XRs ___ and chest and was 
transferred to ___ out of concern for spread of infection to 
her multiple joint prostheses.

At ___, she has been VSS with notable for unremarkable in b/l 
knees. She did have WBC of 13 with BUN/Cr of 1 and was given 1g 
of Vancomycin in the ED before being admitted to medicine for 
further care.

On the floor, the patient confirms that she has had swelling in 
her legs every since she has had her multiple knee replacements, 
most noticeably since she had the complications from her R TKR 
in ___. She was placed on a pump attached to leg stockings to 
help with her swelling. This works but only transiently and 
makes her urinate frequently. Currently, she denies any f/c/r, 
chest pain, SOB, N/V, abd pain. She denies any recent dysuria, 
cough, or other localizing symptoms apart from her increased ___ 
swelling. Both her legs are still more swollen than usual and 
she feels that they are still more red than before, albeit color 
has improved.

MICROBIOLOGY:
___ Blood Culture x2: Negative

IMAGING AND OTHER STUDIES:
___ LENIs:
1. No evidence of deep venous thrombosis in the right or left 
lower extremity veins.
2. Technically inadequate evaluation of the bilateral posterior 
tibial and peroneal veins.

___ PA/LAT CXR:
Lungs are clear generally and reasonably well expanded.  However 
on the lateral view there is the suggestion of a 2.6 cm wide 
elliptical opacity projecting over the ascending thoracic aorta 
that could be a calcified atherosclerotic plaque or a subtle 
lung lesion.  Oblique views are recommended for clarification.

Elevation of the left hemidiaphragm is mild, probably a function 
of intestinal distention.  Heart size is top-normal.  There is 
no mediastinal, hilar, or pleural abnormality.

___ TTE:
The left atrium is elongated. There is mild symmetric left 
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is 
normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal 
(LVEF = 70%). The right ventricular free wall is hypertrophied. 
The right ventricular cavity is dilated with severe global free 
wall hypokinesis. The aortic arch is mildly dilated. There are 
focal calcifications in the aortic arch. The aortic valve 
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not 
present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve 
leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial mitral regurgitation is 
seen. At least mild-to-moserate tricuspid regurgitation is 
present (may be significantly underestimated due to far field 
attenuation). There is borderline pulmonary artery systolic 
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion. There is an 
anterior space which most likely represents a prominent fat pad. 


___ Persanthine Stress: No anginal symptoms or ischemic ST 
segment changes.
Appropriate hemodynamic response to the Persantine infusion. 
Nuclear
report sent separately.

___ P-MIBI:
1. Mild perfusion defect in the mid and distal anteroseptum has 
a 
typical appearance for attenuation, however given apparent 
reversibility on rest images, it is difficult to exclude on 
underlying genuine perfusion defect.    
2. Normal left ventricular cavity size and systolic function. 

___ PFTs
Impression: Moderate obstructive ventilatory defect. Lung 
volumes and gas exchange are within normal limits. There are no 
prior studies available for comparison.

___ CHEST (PA, LAT AND OBLIQUES):
Heart size and mediastinum are stable.  Lungs are essentially 
clear.  Right mid lung area of scarring is unchanged.  There is 
no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. 

___ Right and Left Cardiac Catheterization
Impressions:
1. Normal right and left heart filling pressures
2. Normal coronary arteries

Brief Hospital Course:
This is a ___ year old female with past medical history of morbid 
obesity, diabetes type 2, COPD, admitted ___ with right 
lower extremity cellulitis and acute right heart failure, course 
notable for diuresis (123.5 kg to 115 kg), with 
subsequent heart failure workup without signs of primary 
pulmonary hypertension or obstructive CAD, now clinically 
improved and medically ready for discharge with close cardiology 
follow-up.  

# Acute-On-Chronic diastolic CHF exacerbation with Right Heart 
Failure: The patient presented with a history of chronic ___ 
edema since complications of prior knee surgeries. She had 
notable venous stasis changes in her skin suggesting a chronic 
process. Given the patient's history of subacute progression of 
her ___ edema, there was concern for a superimposed process. She 
also had significantly elevated JVP on exam without any signs of 
pulmonary edema or significant respiratory symptoms, concerning 
for possible RHF. She underwent TTE showing preserved LVEF 
(>70%) but severely dilated and hypertrophied RV with global 
hypoactivity in no particular vascular distribution. In order to 
help work-up this new-onset heart failure, she also underwent 
P-MIBI showing possible small region of reversible ischemia in 
the mid-to-distal LAD territory as well as PFTs, with only mild 
obstructive and restrictive disease. She was evaluated by 
cardiology, who took her for RHC and LHC, showing normal filling 
pressures and coronary arteries. Most likely, she had 
acute-on-chronic, undiagnosed heart failure triggered by recent 
cellulitis. She was diuresed aggressively with IV lasix from 
admission weight of 124.8kg to 115.7 kg.  She was discharged on 
10 mg oral furosemide daily.

# Left Lower Extremity Cellulitis: The patient presented with 
history concerning for initial unilateral swelling and erythema, 
consistent with LLE cellulitis. She underwent ___ duplex without 
any signs of DVT. She had already initiated outpatient course of 
keflex for this infection, which was completed in the hospital 
for total of ___ased on clinical improvement of her 
symptoms.

# Nocturnal Hypoxemia consistent with likely Obstructive Sleep 
Apnea: While in the hospital, the patient was noticed to have 
nocturnal desaturations to the mid-to-high 80's on RA, requiring 
2L NC. Given her body habitus and asymptomatic nocturnal 
desaturations, the patient likely has some component of OSA, 
also undiagnosed. She trialed CPAP in the hospital and will have 
follow up with sleep medicine for consideration of CPAP as an 
outpatient.

# Asthma: The patient was continued on her home Advair during 
this admission.

# Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus: The patient had a history of T2DM, 
well controlled with diet alone. She was found to have an HbA1c 
of 6.5% this admission and was not initiated on any 
anti-hyperglycemic therapy during this admission.

# ASCVD primary prevention: The patient was found to have an 
ASCVD risk score >10%, even with optimized risk factors.  She 
continued on ASA81 and was transitioned from simvastatin 20 mg 
per day to atorvastatin 20 mg per day.

# GERD: She was continued on her home omeprazole 20mg PO BID 
during this admission.

# HTN: The patient was continued on her home lisinopril during 
this admission but at a lower dose, initially due to concern for 
sepsis and subsequently to facilitate blood pressure room for 
aggressive diuresis. On discharge she was on lisinopril 2.5 mg 
per day and metoprolol succinate 25 mg per day.
 
# Bladder Spasm: The patient was continued on her home 
oxybutynin during this admission.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,

You were admitted because of increasing swelling in your legs 
and difficulty with your breathing. You most likely had an 
infection of your leg (cellulitis), which cause the initial 
redness of your left leg. However, you were also diagnosed with 
congestive heart failure based on a picture of your heart 
(transthoracic echocardiograph). This means that the squeezing 
function of your heart is poor. This was most likely what was 
causing most of the swelling in both your legs.

In the hospital, you were given medications (Lasix) to remove 
all the extra fluid from your body.  At home, you should take 10 
mg of Lasix each day.  You should also take 25 mg of metoprolol 
each day.  You should stop taking simvastatin 20 mg per day and 
start taking 20 mg of atorvastatin instead.  Please take your 
weight every ___ days and let your physician know if you gain 
more than 3 pounds in 5 days.

You should follow up with your primary care physician, 
___, and sleep medicine.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the orthopedic surgery service and 
was taken to the operating room for above described procedure. 
Please see separately dictated operative report for details. The 
surgery was uncomplicated and the patient tolerated the 
procedure well. Patient received perioperative IV antibiotics.

Postoperative course was remarkable for the following:

Overnight on postoperative day 0, the patient was found to have 
blood pressure in the 70's.  She was given a 500ml bolus of 
lactated ringers with improvement of her blood pressure to the 
90's. She also required straight catheterization for urinary 
retention.  She was eventually able to void independently.

On postoperative day 1, the patient again had blood pressure in 
the 80's.  She was given a bolus of 500mls normal saline x 2 
with her blood pressure again in the 90's. She remained 
asymptomatic. She was then given Torsemide later in the day when 
she was noted to be 5 liters positive.  Her blood pressure then 
stabilized.

The patient was seen by the wound nurse for ___ right posterior 
thigh questionable pressure ulcer.  It was recommended to cover 
the area with a mepilex and change every 3 days.   

Otherwise, pain was controlled with a combination of IV and oral 
pain medications.  The patient received lovenox for DVT 
prophylaxis starting on the morning of POD#1.  The surgical 
dressing was changed and the Silverlon dressing was removed on 
POD#2. The surgical incision was found to be clean and intact 
without erythema or abnormal drainage. The patient was seen 
daily by physical therapy. Labs were checked throughout the 
hospital course and repleted accordingly. At the time of 
discharge the patient was tolerating a regular diet and feeling 
well.  The patient was afebrile with stable vital signs.  The 
patient's hematocrit was acceptable and pain was adequately 
controlled on an oral regimen. The operative extremity was 
neurovascularly intact and the wound was benign

The patient's weight-bearing status is weight bearing as 
tolerated on the operative extremity with posterior precautions. 
Walker or two crutches at all times for 6 weeks.

Ms. ___ is discharged to rehab in stable condition.
