History of Present Illness:
The pt is a ___ year-old right-handed woman with a PMH of
possible CNS vasculitis vs. Susac's syndrome. She was referred
for admission after developing worsening symptoms in ___ of this
year. 

This history is obtained from the patient as well as prior notes
as she has difficulty recalling details of her history. It
appears that Ms. ___ first presented to Dr. ___ in ___. At
that time she had already had several years of episodes of
dizziness and gait difficulties. She was evaluated at that time
for possible CNS disease including stroke and vasculitis. 

Her work-up at that time included an MRI of the brain and cord.
The cord showed no intrinsic abnormalities but there was some
lumbar disc disease and vertebral body hemangioma's. Her MRI of
the brain showed significant ischemia of both the cerebellum and
BG with an old infarct on the R. Given that her symptoms were
progressive and her imaging was not clearly diagnostic but did
show significant small vessel disease, the diagnosis of
vasculitis or demyelination was entertained. She therefore
underwent an LP in ___ which showed a WBC of 18 with a
lymphocytic predominance and an elevated protein of 87.
Oligoclonal bands were negative. Subsequent LP's however have 
not
shown this pleocytosis in ___ and ___. 

Given her evidence of small vessel disease without other known
vascular risk factors, she was referred for brain biopsy in ___
for evaluation of possible vasculitis. This showed 
"periarterial,
meningeal, mononuclear infiltrate, hypertrophic endothelial
cells, and focal fibrinoid necrosis consistent with SMALL
ARTERY/ARTERIOLE VASCULITIS." She also had a hypercoagulability
work-up which was significant for a mild elevation in Protein C
(135, range is normal to 123). Her Lupus Anticoagulant and
Antithrombin III were negative. Serum ACE, RF, ___, 
Homocysteine,
Lyme and Protein S were all negative as well. RPR was last 
tested
in ___ and was negative. Of note, one of her prior labs from
___ revealed a low TSH of 0.16. Her B12 has been checked twice
and was normal. Review of her labs reveals mildly elevated ESR's
up to 40 (last checked in ___. 

Her course is otherwise remarkable for and admission for
confusion and nocturnal urinary incontinence in ___ after her
brain biopsy. At that time she also noted to have a left facial
droop and mild left hemiparesis which improved. She underwent an
EEG (which was normal) and was loaded with dilantin for concern
for seizures. It was during this admission that she was started
on cyclophosphamide 100mg Qday for CNV vasculitis. Review of her
other studies reveals that she also had a TTE with bubble study
in ___ which was normal. Of note, it seems in her prior records
that she has also had episodes L and R sided numbness and
weakness in the past as well. 

Ms. ___ seems to have been stable for a number of years after
starting the Cytoxan. She was tapered off dilantin and remained
seizure free. Her symptoms did not recur however in ___ she
developed anemia and her Cytoxan had to be discontinued. She was
then referred to Dr. ___ a second opinion. At that time,
the possibility of Susac's syndrome was raised but not clearly
diagnostic. It appears she was then referred to a
neuro-ophthalmologist, however results of this evaluation are 
not
available. 

After being off Cytoxan for a period of time, Ms. ___ developed
new symptoms and she was then restarted on Cytoxan. CellCept
1000mg bid was also considered as an alternative long term
treatment, however it does not appear that she was started on
this. Her last MRI in our system was in ___ and showed multiple
scattered foci o chronic microvascular disease but no new
lesions. 

She then transferred care to another neurologist, Dr. ___ discontinued ___ in ___. She remained symptom free 
until
___ of this year when she developed numbness of her L hand. 
She
then developed abrupt onset L facial drooping and L arm weakness
in ___. She was taken to an OSH where she was admitted for a day
and then discharged. She recalls having had an MRI however the
results of this evaluation and imaging are not available. Her
symptoms resolved the following day. She then returned to her
current neurologist, and then was referred to Dr. ___
further input. She was seen by Dr. ___ in clinic on the ___
and admission for evaluation of active vasculitis was
recommended. She therefore presented today for admission.

ROS:  per HPI
The pt denied headache, loss of vision, blurred vision, 
diplopia,
dysarthria, dysphagia, lightheadedness, vertigo, tinnitus or
hearing difficulty. Denied difficulties producing or
comprehending speech. Denied new focal weakness, numbness,

MRI/A Head: (___)
Post-surgical changes within the right frontal lobe from a prior 

biopsy are stable in appearance, with a small amount of 
surrounding gliosis. No intracranial hemorrhage, edema, mass, 
mass effect, shift of normally midline structures, or infarct is 
identified. Small focus of cystic encephalomalacia within right 
basal ganglia likely reflects an old lacunar infarct, and is 
stable. Scattered periventricular T2 and FLAIR 
hyperintensities are most compatible with chronic small vessel 
ischemic 
disease, and are stable. No new lesions are identified. 
  
There is marked cerebral and cerebellar volume loss, similar in 
extent from prior study. No diffusion-weighted abnormalities are 
identified. Following contrast administration, no abnormal 
enhancement is seen. 
  
Mildly dilated ventricles- lateral and third are noted; mildly 
increased since ___. NPH is in the Ddx given the aqueductal 
flow void sign though the aqueduct itself is not dilated. 
  
On the MRA, there is a possible contour outpouching at the left 
A1 segment, which may be artifactual or could reflect an 
adjacent venous structure. Otherwise, the intracranial vertebral 
and internal carotid arteries and their major branches are 
unremarkable, without evidence of stenosis, occlusion, or 
aneurysm. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ year-old RH woman with a complex PMH of progressive 
difficulties with gait, dizziness, urinary incontinence and 
cognitive difficulties. She has had
extensive evaluations in the past with multiple MRI's, LP and 
brain biopsy concerning for a primary CNS vasculitis for which 
she was treated with Cytoxan for several years. Her symptoms 
remained quiescent while on this treatment. She discontinued 
this medication in the past for concern for leukopenia but then 
had
possible recurrence of symptoms. She then discontinued this 
medication again last year but developed recurrence of symptoms 
in ___. This episode was characterized by a 1 day history of L 
face and hand weakness (a symptom which she has had in the 
past). Nature of this previous episode is unclear, but is 
concerning for recrudescence of Susac's syndrome, which could 
potentially require initiation of immune suppressive therapies 
to prevent recurrent stroke. She was admitted for urgent 
evaluation including Lumbar puncture and MRI/A. CSF profile was 
with 0 WBC, Protein 59 and otherwise normal profile. MRI/A was 
without evidence for vasculitis. Though considered a 
conventional angiogram was not pursued given lack of 
inflammatory cells within the CSF. 

The patient was evaluated by ___ and recommended for continued 
outpatient ___. She was started on aggrenox BID for secondary 
stroke prevention. She will see her primary neurologist Dr. 
___ in ___ weeks for further care. She will require a 
hypercoagulability profile drawn during the follow up visit.

History of Present Illness:
PER ADMITTING RESIDENT:
The pt is a ___ year-old right-handed woman with a PMH of
possible CNS vasculitis vs. Susac's syndrome who presents with
left sided weakness and left facial weakness for 3 days.

Patient's neurologic symptoms started in ___ with gait
difficulty and dizziness. She had a brain MRI at that time that
revealed ischemic changes in the cerebellum and basal ganglia. 
An
LP showed pleocytosis (WBC 18 prot 87 neg oligoclonal bands). A
brain biopsy in ___ was diagnostic of small artery/arteriole
vasculitis. She was started on cytoxan at that time. A
hypercoagulable panel showed elevated protein C. In ___ she had
a transient episode of left facial droop and hemiparesis. She 
has
had several episodes of L and R sided numbness and
weakness in the past as well. The last one ocurred in ___
with left arm weakness and left facial droop. She has been on 
and
off cytoxan due to side effects, especially anemia. Patient
reports that she has been off it since ___.
Patient was recently admitted to the neurology service
(___) for work-up of active vasculitis after having been
seen in Dr. ___. Her MRI was read as not showing
evidence of vasculitis; her CSF was normal. She was started on
aggrenox

Patient reports that for the past 3 days she has had more
difficulty to walk, in particular going up the stairs. Her
husband noticed two days ago that she had a left facial droop.
She denied any visual changes or paresthesias. 
This morning, she woke-up at 2am and tried to get out of bed.
Because her left side was weaker, mostly the leg, she kept 
trying
to do so for an hour and then when she could stand-up she fell
down on the floor. Her husband called EMS and she was taken to
___ where her head CT was read as normal and she was
transferred here.

IMAGING
.
CTA Head and Neck (___):
1. No evidence of hemorrhage or recent infarction detected.
2. Old infarcts involving the right caudate nucleus and right 
external
capsule.
3.No stenosis or occlusion of the carotid,vertebral arteries and 
their major
branches. A small 1.5 mm outpouching of the left A1 segment of 
the left
Anterior cerebral artery is most likely an infundibulum as 
discussed above,
but could represent a tiny aneurysm.
.
MRI Head (___):
IMPRESSION:
1. Multiple new extensive areas of leptomeningeal FLAIR 
hyperintensity and
enhancement involving all lobes as well as the cerebellum. There 
is suggestion
of areas of decreased diffusion, and possibly cortical 
involvement as well.
The findings are compatible with the given diagnosis of CNS 
vasculitis
exacerbation.
2. Stable post-surgical changes relate to a right frontal 
biopsy.
3. Enlargement of the ventricles since ___, although there has 
been
stability since ___. Given the disproportionate dialtion of the 
lateral
ventricles wrf to cerebral sulci and T2 aqueductal flow void 
sign,
superimposed NPH with central volume loss can be in the DDx and 
can be
corrleated clinically.
4. Old infarcts involving the right basal ganglia and right 
pons.
.
EEG (___):
IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal routine EEG due to the slow 
background.
These findings suggest a widespread mild to moderate 
encephalopathy
affecting both cortical and subcortical structures. Medications, 
toxic/
metabolic disturbances, and infection are among the most common 
causes.
There were no areas of prominent focal slowing although 
encephalopathies
can obscure focal findings. There were no epileptiform features.
.
MRI Cervical Spine (___):
IMPRESSION: Degenerative changes in the cervical region without 
high-grade
spinal stenosis or foraminal narrowing. No extrinsic spinal cord 
compression
or intrinsic spinal cord signal abnormalities. No abnormal 
enhancement.
 .
MRI Thoracic Spine (___):
MPRESSION: Mild multilevel degenerative changes. Subtle signal 
within the
lower thoracic spinal cord could be intrinsic abnormality or due 
to artifacts.
Given the patient's clinical history of lower extremity 
weakness, repeat study
of the thoracic spine with sagittal inversion recovery and 
diffusion images
and axial T2-weighted images through the distal spinal cord are 
recommended.
No abnormal enhancement or extrinsic spinal cord compression 
seen.
.
Transthoracic Echocardiogram (___):
The left atrium is normal in size. No atrial septal defect or 
patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline 
contrast. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and 
global systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%). The estimated 
cardiac index is normal (>=2.5L/min/m2). Tissue Doppler imaging 
suggests a normal left ventricular filling pressure 
(PCWP<12mmHg). The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly 
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic 
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are 
structurally normal. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Trivial 
mitral regurgitation is seen. The estimated pulmonary artery 
systolic pressure is normal. 

IMPRESSION: No intracardiac source of embolism identified. 
Preserved biventricular systolic function. 
 
 
 
 
 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ is a ___ year-old right-handed woman with a history 
including CNS vasculitis who presented to the ___ with a three 
day history of left hemiparesis.  She was 
admitted to the stroke service from ___ to ___.
.
# NEURO:
At the time of admission, a CT of the head was performed.  
Although the study demonstrated remote infarcts involving the 
right caudate nucleus and external
capsule, there was no evidence of hemorrhage.  Imaging of the 
major vessels revealed no stenosis or occlusion of the carotid 
and vertebral arteries or their major branches. As the patient's 
symptoms were concerning for stroke, an MRI was performed.  The 
imaging revealed multiple new extensive areas of leptomeningeal 
FLAIR hyperintensity and enhancement involving all lobes as well 
as the cerebellum. There were also areas of decreased diffusion, 
and possibly cortical involvement, thought to be consistent CNS 
vasculitis and resultant infarctions.  Aggrenox was continued.
. 
A transthoracic echocardiogram was performed to evaluate for 
cardiac contributions to the patient's symptom complex.  There 
was no ASD, PFO, vegetation, or thrombus noted.   The estimated  
systolic function was normal (LVEF >55%). 
.
To evaluate modifiable risk factors for stroke, lipids and 
glycosylated hemoglobin were measured.  The LDL was found to be 
75, so no medication changes were made.  The HBA1C was 5.5%. 
.
Of note, on imaging the ventricles appeared stable in size 
relative to ___. As there was no new ventriculomegaly and the 
patient had developed a metabolic acidosis, the acetazolamide 
was discontinued in the course of the hospitalization.  The 
patient declined treatment with baclofen, so the medication was 
also discontinued.
.
As there was some concern the patient was exhibiting signs of 
seizure, an EEG was performed.  While the telemetry was 
suggestive of encephalopathy, there was no epileptiform 
activity.
.
Early in the course of the hospitalization, the patient's lower 
extremity strength was thought to significantly decrease.  To 
evaluate for contributory lesions, MRIs of the cervical and 
lumbar spine were performed.  No extrinsic spinal cord 
compression or intrinsic spinal cord signal abnormalities were 
identified.
.
Elevations in ESR and CRP were noted.  Similarly, results of an 
initial lumbar puncture (LP) showed changes thought to reflect 
an acute inflammatory reaction.  Primarily due to concern that 
the low CSF glucose could suggest infection, the lumbar puncture 
was repeated.  The second LP revealed a lymphocytic pleocytosis 
indicative of ongoing inflammation.  In this setting the 
infectious disease and rheumatology teams agreed it would be 
safe to administer high-dose steroids.
.
# RHEUM:
The rheumatology team was consulted to help guide the 
administration of immunosuppressive therapy.  At their 
suggestion, a three-day pulse of IV solumedrol was administered. 
 Subsequently prednisone (1mg/kg) was started, along with 
bactrim for PCP ___.  Treatment with Imuran was not 
started as enzyme studies for TPMT were still pending.  The use 
of the agent will be re-evaluated when Ms. ___ attends a 
___ rheumatology appointment in approximately three weeks.
.
# ID:
At the time of admission, the patient was thought to have 
evidence of a urinary tract infection.  In the setting of 
recurrent urinary tract infections, a 7-day course of 
ciprofloxacin was started.  The antibiotic was discontinued when 
the urine culture was found to be negative.
.
At the recommendation of the Infectious Disease team, a panel of 
serum and cerebrospinal fluid assays were performed.  The goal 
was to rule out especially serious covert infections, such as 
fungal processes, prior to starting IV solumedrol and or 
immunosuppressive therapy.  Studies for Hepatitis B IgM,
