Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ is a ___ y/o M with a history of schizophrenia with 
multiple psychiatric hospitalizations, anxiety, depression, 
hypertension, who presents with auditory hallucinations in the 
setting of crack cocaine use and found to have acute kidney 
injury, leukocytosis, and elevated CK.

#Polysubstance Abuse/Alcohol withdrawal: Patient has poor 
insight into his substance abuse with multiple ED visits for 
crack cocaine use with hallucinations. Patient unable to 
quantify how much alcohol he drinks but with hx of ED visits, 
very concerning for alcohol abuse. Was placed on diazepam for 
CIWA >10 but did not score. Hallucinations were resolving on day 
of admission and completely resolved on day of discharge, 
ultimately attributed to cocaine use.  

#RBBB: EKG showed likely rate-related conduction delay RBBB and 
T wave abnormalities on day of admission, which resolved with 
improvement in rate.  Initially concerning for possible coronary 
vasospasm in the setting of cocaine, however given nl cardiac 
enzymes and resolution with a normal rate, this was thought to 
be less likely. No complaints of any chest pain, dyspnea.

___: Likely pre-renal etiology from intoxication and possibly 
being down. Cr elevated to 1.4 from baseline 1. Improved with 
fluids, discharge Cr 0.9. 

#Leukocytosis - Resolved during the hospitalization without 
intervention, no infx sxs, likely stress response from crack 
cocaine/rhabdo. 

#Rhabdomyolysis: Resolved with IVF. Patient does not report 
being found down, although he is a very poor historian. Does not 
report chest pain, EKG, and tropsnot suggestive of ischemia.

#Schizophrenia: Patient has had multiple admissions for 
schizophrenia
His mental health provider is ___ at ___ in 
___, the number is ___. Fax ___. Attempted 
to call outpatient provider but no response as office is closed 
on weekend. Patient reports that he received his risperdone 
consta ___.  Per psych, his hallucinations are likely from 
crack cocaine and no need to give risperdone consta unless we 
obtain collateral from psych provider that he did not get his 
injection. Denied SI, HI during the hospitalization and at the 
time of discharge.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUE

[] RBBB: EKG showed rate related RBBB. If persists or has in the 
future, may need echocardiogram to look for structural 
abnormalities.

cocaine and alcohol. Please provide resource for him as social

Brief Hospital Course:
This is a ___ year old unemployed, single Latino man, previously 
diagnosed with schizophrenia, borderline intellectual 
functioning (unconfirmed), cocaine and alcohol use disorder, s/p 
numerous psychiatric hospitalizations, recently seen in the 
___ for self reported depression and command auditory 
hallucinations in the setting of ongoing cocaine use who 
presented via EMS after patient was found disoriented in a gas 
station stating he wished to kill himself via stabbing himself 
in the chest with a knife. 
. 
Diagnostically, differential is broad and review of the medical 
records is concerning for a primary psychotic disorder with 
history of AVH, paranoia in the past, requiring psychiatric 
admission. There is also a history of intellectual disability 
which may very well be contributing to his presentation, 
although I cannot confirm this diagnosis at this time. Clearly 
his cocaine use is contributing and likely responsible for the 
acute nature of his numerous psychiatric presentation.
.
#. Legal / Safety: On admission, the patient signed a 
conditional voluntary agreement (Section 10 & 11. On ___ he 
signed a 3-day notice which was set to expire on ___ (the day 
of discharge). He was also placed on 15 minute checks status on 
admission and remained on that level of observation throughout 
while being unit restricted. Given his good behavioral control 
and consistent denial of suicidal ideation or thoughts of self 
harm, I did not believe he met criteria to file a 7&8b and 
patient was discharged home with outpatient follow up. 
. 
#. Schizophrenia: On admission the patient denied ongoing 
auditory hallucinations. He stated that in the remote past he 
experienced hallucinations and paranoia when not using 
substances. More recently, he has only experienced 
hallucinations and non-linear thought process in the setting of 
substance use (as on admission). On admission he was started on 
Risperidone PO. He was briefly transitioned to Paliperidone PO 
with plans to initiate treatment with Invega Sustenna. After the 
patient signed a 3-day notice which was set to expire on ___, 
he was transitioned back to Risperidone PO with plans to 
initiate treatment with Risperidone Consta prior to discharge. 
The patient was in agreement with this plan. His first dose of 
Consta (37.5mg IM) was given on ___ with plan for second dose 
to be given on ___. The patient's PCP ___ that 
the patient had been on Consta in the past and had done 
reasonably well on the medication (though he was frequently lost 
to follow-up in the setting of substance use and subsequent 
decompensation of schizophrenia). During admission the patient 
was also offered PRN Lorazepam for anxiety which he frequently 
used (this medication was stopped the day prior to discharge). 
On the day of discharge the patient was future oriented, eager 
to engage in outpatient treatment, and denied SI, HI, AH, VH.

The patient was encouraged to participate in the various groups 
and milieu therapy opportunities offered by the unit. The 
patient often attended these groups that focused on teaching 
patients various coping skills. He was friendly and sociable in 
the milieu.
.  
#. Cocaine use disorder: The patient and collateral contacts 
note that his underlying Schizophrenia has decompensated in the 
past when he abuses crack cocaine. During admission he was 
offered psychoeducation regarding effect of cocaine use and his 
underlying schizophrenia. He appeared to gain greater insight 
into the risks of cocaine use prior to discharge.
. 
# Alcohol use disorder: On admission the patient was monitored 
on CIWAS for alcohol withdrawal. This was discontinued shortly 
after admission as it was no longer required. He was offered 
psychoeducation regarding effect of alcohol use and his 
underlying schizophrenia.
. 
# Tobacco Use disorder: The patient declined offer of Tobacco 
cessation medications on discharge.

#. Medical:  The patient reported no acute or chronic complaints 
during admission.

RISK ASSESSMENT: On presentation, the patient was evaluated and 
felt to be at an increased risk of harm to herself and/or others 
based upon reported suicidal ideation, command auditory 
hallucinations, poor outpatient follow-up, medication 
non-compliance, poor insight/judgment, chronic mental illness, 
history of substance abuse, history of violence and male gender. 
 The modifiable risk factors were also addressed during 
admission via medication treatment, milieu/individual/group 
therapies, and establishing him with outpatient providers. The 
patient is being discharged with many protective risk factors 
including current medication compliance, help-seeking behavior, 
future-oriented viewpoint, reality testing ability, positive 
therapeutic relationship with outpatient providers, lack of 
suicidal ideation, and strong social supports.

Overall, based on the totality of our assessment at this time, 
the patient is not at an acutely elevated risk of self-harm nor 
danger to others.
