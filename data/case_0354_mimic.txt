Brief Hospital Course:
The patient presented as mentioned above and was admitted under 
the acute care surgery service on ___. The patient looked 
fairly well by exam but with right lower quadrant tenderness.  
She did not have peritonitis, leukocytosis, and CT
findings consistent with appendicitis with possible early 
phlegmonous changes. Hence she was started on IV antibiotics. 
She was taken to the operating room and underwent a laparoscopic 
appendectomy. Please see operative report for details of this 
procedure. Intraoperative findings were significant for a 
gangrenous perforated appendix and a JP was left in. She 
tolerated the procedure well and was extubated upon completion. 
She was subsequently taken to the PACU for recovery and was 
transferred to the surgical floor hemodynamically stable. 

On the floor her vital signs were routinely monitored and she 
remained afebrile and hemodynamically stable. Postoperative stay 
was significant for emesis and loose stools x 6 on POD2. C.diff 
assay was negitive. She was initially given IV fluids and 
continued on IV antibiotics postoperatively, which were 
discontinued and converted to oral when she was tolerating PO's. 
Her diet was sequentially advanced to regular. Her JP drain 
output was monitored every day.

At the time of discharge on ___, the patient was doing 
well, afebrile with stable vital signs. The patient was 
tolerating a regular diet, ambulating and pain was well 
controlled. She had passed formed stools twice. The plan was to 
keep the JP drain in, send the patient home with ___ on oral 
antibiotics for 7 days and follow up in clinic in a week. The 
patient received discharge teaching and follow-up instructions 
and verbalized understanding of and agreement with the discharge 
plan.

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted to the hospital with acute appendicitis. You 
were taken to the operating room and had your appendix removed 
laparoscopically.  You tolerated the procedure well and are now 
being discharged home with the following instructions:
Please follow up at the appointment in clinic listed below. We 
also generally recommend that patients follow up with their 
primary care provider after having surgery. We have scheduled an 
appointment for you listed below.
ACTIVITY:
 
Do not drive until you have stopped taking pain medicine and 
feel you could respond in an emergency.
You may climb stairs. 
You may go outside, but avoid traveling long distances until you 
see your surgeon at your next visit.
Don't lift more than ___ lbs for ___ weeks. (This is about the 
weight of a briefcase or a bag of groceries.) This applies to 
lifting children, but they may sit on your lap.
You may start some light exercise when you feel comfortable.
You will need to stay out of bathtubs or swimming pools for a 
time while your incision is healing. Ask your doctor when you 
can resume tub baths or swimming.
 
HOW YOU MAY FEEL: 
You may feel weak or "washed out" a couple weeks. You might want 
to nap often. Simple tasks may exhaust you.
You may have a sore throat because of a tube that was in your 
throat during surgery.
You could have a poor appetite for a couple days. Food may seem 
unappealing.
All of these feelings and reactions are normal and should go 
away in a short time.  If they do not, tell your surgeon.
 
YOUR INCISION:
Tomorrow you may shower and remove the gauzes over your 
incisions. Under these dressings you have small plastic bandages 
called steristrips. Do not remove steri-strips for 2 weeks. 
(These are the thin paper strips that might be on your 
incision.) But if they fall off before that that's okay.
Your incisions may be slightly red around the stitches. This is 
normal.
You may gently wash away dried material around your incision.
Avoid direct sun exposure to the incision area.
Do not use any ointments on the incision unless you were told 
otherwise.
You may see a small amount of clear or light red fluid staining 
your dressing or clothes. If the staining is severe, please call 
your surgeon.
You may shower. As noted above, ask your doctor when you may 
resume tub baths or swimming.
 
YOUR BOWELS:
Constipation is a common side effect of narcotic pain 
medicaitons. If needed, you may take a stool softener (such as 
Colace, one capsule) or gentle laxative (such as milk of 
magnesia, 1 tbs) twice a day. You can get both of these 
medicines without a prescription.
If you go 48 hours without a bowel movement, or have pain moving 
the bowels, call your surgeon. 
 
PAIN MANAGEMENT:
It is normal to feel some discomfort/pain following abdominal 
surgery. This pain is often described as "soreness". 
Your pain should get better day by day. If you find the pain is 
getting worse instead of better, please contact your surgeon.
You will receive a prescription for pain medicine to take by 
mouth. It is important to take this medicine as directed. Do not 
take it more frequently than prescribed. Do not take more 
medicine at one time than prescribed. Do not drink alcohol or 
drive while taking narcotic pain medication.
Your pain medicine will work better if you take it before your 
pain gets too severe.
Talk with your surgeon about how long you will need to take 
prescription pain medicine. Please don't take any other pain 
medicine, including non-prescription pain medicine, unless your 
surgeon has said its okay.
If you are experiencing no pain, it is okay to skip a dose of 
pain medicine.
Remember to use your "cough pillow" for splinting when you cough 
or when you are doing your deep breathing exercises.
If you experience any of the following, please contact your 
surgeon:
- sharp pain or any severe pain that lasts several hours
- pain that is getting worse over time
- pain accompanied by fever of more than 101
- a drastic change in nature or quality of your pain
 
MEDICATIONS:
Take all the medicines you were on before the operation just as 
you did before, unless you have been told differently.
If you have any questions about what medicine to take or not to 
take, please call your surgeon.
