Brief Hospital Course:
SAFETY:  The patient was placed on Q5 minute checks on admission 
and was gradually advanced to Q15 minute checks.  Patient was 
unit-restricted.  There were no acute safety issues during this 
hospitalization.

LEGAL: ___
PSYCHIATRIC:
# Unspecified depressive disorder; cluster B traits: On 
admission to the unit patient endorsed low mood, poor energy, 
minimal sleep and continued suicidal ideation with intrusive 
thoughts of worthlessness and a desire to cut herself.  She was 
continued on her home medication regimen (which she had not 
formerly been taking consistently) of Sertraline, Seroquel and 
Trazodone with additional trazodone available as needed for 
insomnia.  Her outpatient PCP (prescriber of psychiatric 
medications) and several family members were contacted for 
collateral.  The patient was encouraged to implement coping 
strategies when intrusive thoughts or desires to self harm 
surfaced.  She was able to notify staff on several different 
occasions when she was feeling unsafe.  Over the course of her 
hospitalization she engaged in interpersonal, milieu and 
occupational therapy and exhibited a steady improvement in mood 
and a decrease in intrusive thoughts.  Although showing signs of 
improvement, the patient did not complete her full course of 
treatment on the inpatient unit and will likely require 
re-admission following the surgical procedure.  

# History of bulimia
Patient did not report binging or purging behaviors while 
admitted on the unit.  SHe was followed by nutrition and her PO 
intake was monitored.  She was noted to eat small-moderate 
portions of most meals with Ensure supplementation.  Given 
current clinical status she was not appropriate for eating 
disorder protocol.  Orthostatics were monitored as well as 
weekly labs and were all within normal limits.

#Alcohol use d/o: Patient did not exhibit symptoms of simple or 
complex alcohol withdrawal while on Deaconess 4.  She was 
provided with daily thiamine, MVI and folate and was encouraged 
to attend unit AA/___ recovery meetings.  During her admission 
she was provided with alcohol cessation resources.

___ MEDICAL CONDITIONS:
#Abdominal pain: Following her transfer from medicine the 
patient reported continued epigastric and RUQ abdominal pain, 
only moderately relieved by PO oxycodone.  She also developed 
new abdominal pain related to a mass on the anterior right 
aspect of her abdomen underneath a prior surgical scar.  
Medicine was consulted and felt most consistent with abscess.  A 
bedside sample was taken from the fluid collection/mass and sent 
for analysis.  She also received an abdominal CT which showed 
likely Gastro cutaneous fistula.  She was transferred to the 
bariatric surgical service for further work up and management.  

#Cirrhosis: Patient was diagnosed with cirrhosis, likely ___ 
ETOH use while on medicine prior to Deac4 admission.  The 
patient was continued on the same medications and will have 
follow-up in hepatology and ___ clinic.

#PUD/s/p gastric bypass: Bypass also complicated by marginal 
ulcers, only gastritis seen on EGD during medicine admission.  
Pt was continued on Sucralfate and Pantoprazole.

#R pleural effusion: Pleural studies are consistent with hepatic 
hydrothorax per medicine discharge note.  Patient was continued 
on the medication regimen started prior to admission and will 
schedule f/u in ___ weeks in ___ clinic.

#Anemia: During medicine admission patient showed no signs of 
active bleeding. Responded appropriately to 1U PRBC. Found to 
have antibodies, likely from prior
transfusions. Suspect anemia primarily due to acute illness and 
likely underlying anemia of chronic disease due to cirrhosis vs 
slow oozing from gastritis. CBC improved throughout admission- 
repeat CBC at next clinic appointment. ***In the future the 
patient should receive E-antigen negative  products for all red 
cell transfusions. Approximately 71% of ABO compatible blood 
will be E-antigen negative.

#Leukopenia: Likely due to underlying cirrhosis, has been stable 
to improving.
 
#Thrombocytopenia: Stable to improving, likely due to underlying 
cirrhosis. 

#Focal nodular opacity overlying the ___ lateral ribs seen 
to move separate from the ribs on oblique radiographs suggesting 
that it is pleural and may represent a pleural plaque. Repeat PA 
and lateral chest radiograph in 3 months is recommended for
follow-up. Separate letter sent to PCP by medicine.
 
PSYCHOSOCIAL:
#) GROUPS/MILIEU: Patient was encouraged to participate in the 
unit’s groups/milieu/therapy opportunities. Use of coping skills 
and mindfulness/relaxation methods were encouraged. Therapy 
addressed family/social/work issues.

#) COLLATERAL CONTACTS/FAMILY CONTACTS:
Collateral was obtained from father, boyfriend and PCP.

#) INTERVENTIONS:
- Medications: continued home psychiatric medications (Zoloft, 
Seroquel, trazodone)
- Psychotherapeutic Interventions: Individual, group, and milieu 
therapy.
- Coordination of aftercare: by social work, MDs, RNs and 
outpatient treaters

INFORMED CONSENT:  NO NEW MEDICATIONS STARTED AS OF ___ 

RISK ASSESSMENT: 
#) Chronic/Static Risk Factors:
Chronic medical illness, chronic substance use, chronic 
psychiatric illness, prior suicide attempts

#) Modifiable Risk Factors: In the process of 
addressing/augmenting, now requiring transfer to bariatric 
surgery.
Medication nonadhearance - modified by providing medications 
daily while admitted and reinforcing the importance of 
medication compliance
Active mood disturbance - modified by medication optimization 
and therapy
Intrusive thoughts - modified with reinforcement of coping 
skills
Active alcohol use - mediated by providing a sober environment, 
offering AA/SMART recovery meetings to patient and arranging 
outpatient alcohol abstinence resources
No connection w/ outpatient psychiatrist or therapist - modified 
by connecting to outpatient treaters

#) Protective Factors:
Strong social support, treatment-seeking, stable housing

PROGNOSIS:
Patient presented with significant depression, intrusive 
thoughts and suicidality that interfered with psychosocial 
functioning.  Prognosis is good given symptomatic improvement, 
reinforcement of coping techniques, connection with outpatient 
providers, motivation to seek further treatment and support in 
the community.  The patient was taught about warning signs and 
understands that there are many resources, including the 
emergency department that she can follow-up with.

___ CXR: IMPRESSION: Moderate to moderately large right 
pleural 
effusion, with underlying collapse and/or consolidation.

___ RUQ US: 
IMPRESSION:
1. Echogenic nodular liver suggesting underlying cirrhosis with 
mild splenomegaly, moderate ascites, and a moderate right 
pleural 
effusions .
2. No biliary dilatation.  No cholecystitis.  No focal liver 
lesion.

___ CT abd/pelvis with contrast: 
IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of bowel obstruction.  Expected appearance status 

post Roux-en-Y gastric bypass with unremarkable appearance of 
the 
anastomoses.
2. Macro lobulated liver consistent with cirrhosis/nodular 
regenerative hyperplasia with sequela of portal hypertension 
including 
ascites and splenomegaly.
3. Large right pleural effusion.

___ DIFFICULT CROSSMATCH: 
DIAGNOSIS, ASSESSMENT AND RECOMMENDATIONS: ___ has a 
new diagnosis of an Anti-E antibody. The E-antigen is a member 
of 
the Rh blood group system. Anti-E antibodies are clinically 
significant 
and capable of causing hemolytic transfusion reactions. In the 
future the patient should receive E-antigen negative products 
for all red cell transfusions. Approximately 71% of ABO 
compatible blood will be E-antigen negative.

___ Pleural fluid, right:
NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS. 

___ CXR oblique: 
Focal nodular opacity overlying the ___ lateral ribs seen to 

move separate from the ribs on oblique radiographs suggesting 
that it is pleural and may represent a pleural plaque. Repeat PA 

and lateral chest radiograph in 3 months is recommended for 
follow-up. Remainder of the examination including elevation of 
the right hemidiaphragm and adjacent atelectasis is unchanged. 
RECOMMENDATION(S):  Repeat PA and lateral chest radiograph in 3 
months is recommended for follow-up.

___ GI mucosal biopsy
1. Gastric pouch biopsy: within normal limits.
2. Jejunal biopsy: Mildly distorted villous architecture with a 
very focal mild increase in intraepithelial lymphocytes. The 
findings are not specific. The differential diagnosis includes 
drug effect, infectious etiologies (including bacterial 
overgrowth), inflammatory bowel disease, and immune mediated 
etiologies including celiac disease, among others. Clinical 
correlation is recommended.

___ EGD: 
Erythema, friability in the gastric pouch, consistent with 
gastritis. The GJ anastomosis was carefully examined and no 
ulcers were noted. The anastomosis was widely patent.  Cold 
forceps biopsies were performed for histology at the gastric 
pouch. Duodenum: Other Duodenum not examined. Anatomy 
consistent with prior bypass was noted. The alimentary limb was 
traversed and was grossly normal. The blind limb was also 
examined without abnormalities.  Cold forceps biopsies were 
performed for histology at the jejunum. Impression: No varices. 
Erythema, friability in the gastric pouch, consistent with

Duodenum not examined. Anatomy consistent with prior bypass was 
noted. The alimentary limb was traversed and was grossly normal. 
The blind limb was also examined without abnormalities. (biopsy) 
Otherwise normal EGD to jejunum 

___: CT ABD/PEL:
1. Gastro-cutaneous fistula extending from the native gastric 
antrum to the right upper quadrant as detailed above. 
2. Dysmorphic appearing liver and splenomegaly as detailed  
above, compatible with the known underlying cirrhosis and 
underlying portal hypertension.  Small amount of associated 
ascites has increased compared to prior evaluation.  Assessment 
for solid liver lesions is very limited due to lack of 
intravenous contrast. 
3. Large right pleural effusion, partially imaged but slightly 
worse as compared to prior, as detailed above. 

___ UGI Air w/ KUB 
Attempts to cannulate the patient's cutaneous fistula were 
unsuccessful.  Water-soluble contrast was administered by mouth, 
however the gastro cutaneous fistula was not opacified. 

___ KUB
Nonobstructive bowel gas pattern.

___ CT A/P
1. Postsurgical changes along the anterior abdominal wall 
reflecting recent I&D.  A gastrocutaneous tract is again 
demonstrated but is not definitely patent.  No new or drainable 
collections.  No hematoma. 
2. Cirrhotic liver. 
3. Mild ascites. 
4. Large right pleural effusion with near complete collapse of 
the right lower lobe, unchanged from prior. 

___ Chest PA 
Interval recurrence of a previously drained moderate right 
pleural effusion. Stable mild cardiomegaly. Focal opacity 
overlying the left lateral chest likely represent osteochondroma 
or posttraumatic rib coalition. 

___ KUB 
1. Nonobstructive bowel gas pattern. 
2. Assessment for free intraperitoneal air is limited on supine 
radiographs, however there is no gross pneumoperitoneum. If 
there is clinical concern for pneumoperitoneum, advise upright 
or left lateral decubitus radiograph. 

___ CT Chest
1.  Large nonhemorrhagic right pleural effusion causing near 
complete collapse of the right lower lobe, partial collapse of 
the middle lobe, and mild atelectasis in the right upper lobe. 
2.  Tiny left pleural effusion with mild basilar atelectasis. 

___ CT A/P 
1. A gastrocutaneous fistulous tract from the excluded stomach 
in the biliary limb is once again re- demonstrated, with no 
evidence of fluid within the tract.  No drainable collections. 
2. Interval thickening of the cecum, ascending, and proximal 
transverse 
concerning for infectious colitis, possibly C. difficile. 
3. Cirrhotic liver.  Small to moderate volume ascites. 
4. Moderate to large volume right pleural effusion with 
associated near 
complete collapse of the right lower lobe.  Small left pleural 
effusion with associated mild subsegmental atelectasis, new from 
previous. 

___ CXR
In comparison with the study ___, there again is a 
substantial right layering pleural effusion with underlying 
compressive atelectasis.  However, there is substantial increase 
in opacification involving the left hemithorax.  Although this 
could reflect development of a significant pneumonia, the 
discussion with Dr. ___ that the patient has no 
signs of infection clinically.  Therefore, it is much more 
likely that this is a manifestation of developing pulmonary 
edema, which is difficult to assess on the right side due to the 
overlying pleural effusion.  

___ RUQ US
No intra or extrahepatic ductal dilatation. Hepatic cirrhosis, 
and splenomegaly.  Small perihepatic ascites, and for this 
reason a location was not marked for paracentesis. Bilateral, 
right greater than left, pleural effusions. 

___ CXR
1. New pigtail catheter projects over the right right lower lung 
with a substantial interval decrease in right pleural effusion, 
now small with associated atelectasis. 
2. Trace right apical pneumothorax. 
3. Significant interval improvement in left-sided pulmonary 
edema, now mild. 

___ CXR 
Comparison to ___.  Stable position of the right chest 
tube.  The tube has drained almost all of the pre-existing right 
pleural effusion.  Only a minimal amount of pleural effusion is 
visualized, projecting over the costophrenic sinus.  There is no 
evidence for the presence of a pneumothorax.  The lung volumes 
have decreased and the size of the cardiac silhouette is now at 
the upper range of normal.  No new focal parenchymal opacities.  
The right internal jugular vein catheter is in stable correct 
position. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
TRANSITION ISSUES
=================
- Plan for discharge to home with plans for next day admission 
to ___ Partial Hospital Program
- Medicine Consults recommended outpatient ECHO to evaluate new 
systolic murmur
- Please obtain repeat PA and lateral chest radiograph in 3 
months to follow up ? pleural plaque on CXR
- Has outpatient appointments with PCP, ___, psychiatry 
- Hepatic hydrothorax stable on diuretic regimen of Lasix 
20/Spironolactone 50 at time of discharge; this may need to be 
adjusted in the future 

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
___ year-old female with a history of roux-en-y gastric bypass 
___ at ___ c/b marginal ulcerations, ex lap from bike injury 
s/p ostomy, ETOH abuse, new dx of cirrhosis, and bulimia who 
initially presented with bulimia and was admitted to medicine 
with alcoholic hepatitis and a right pleural effusion/hepatic 
hydrothorax on ___. She underwent a right thoracentesis and 
EGD which confirmed no varices, but showed gastritis. She was 
was monitored and eventually transferred to inpatient psychiatry 
on ___ for low mood, poor energy, and suicidal ideation. She 
was observed eating small-moderate portions and she had no 
symptoms of alcohol withdrawal.  During her hospitalization, she 
was briefly transferred to Acute Care Surgery on ___ for I&D of 
abd wall abscess and then transferred back to the psychiatry 
service. After the I&D, a fistulogram was performed which did 
not reveal a gastrocutaneous fistula, however surgery had 
suspicion that a fistula had formed between the abscess and the 
stomach remnant, which would not have been seen on the 
fistulogram. Wound drainage and surrounding skin irritation was 
managed with placement of an ostomy bag and  barrier cream.  On 
the evening of ___, the medicine team was consulted for 
acute onset abdominal pain. The patient reported diffuse 
abdominal pain that started suddenly and felt subjective fevers 
and shaking chills with diffuse abdominal pain. She reported 
nausea with one episode of green emesis on the floor. She was 
transferred to the ICU for septic shock and acute onset 
abdominal pain of unclear etiology.  Vitals were notable for 
tachycardia to 133, and fever of 103.1. Blood pressure stable at 
115/50. Stat KUB was ordered, which did not demonstrate any 
evidence of free air, although study was limited.  She was 
started on cipro/flagyl as well as peripheral neo. A CVL was 
placed and she was switched to levophed given persistent 
hypotension despite IVF resuscitation. CT was stable compared to 
the one performed ___ showing no worsening abscess. Her course 
was also complicated by hepatic hydrothorax, which was stable 
after initial drainage and PO diuretics. She was medically 
cleared to return to inpatient psychiatry on ___. She underwent 
further medication adjustments and remained medically stable 
except for one episode of diaphoresis and tremulousness due to 
hypoglycemia (BG 46) thought to be secondary to her liver 
dysfunction and poor po intake. She was discharged to ___ 
___ Partial Hospital Program in stable condition with 
no evidence of electrolyte abnormalities and persistent stable 
transaminitis which will need to be followed as an outpatient. 
 
SAFETY:  The patient was placed on Q5 minute checks on admission 
and was gradually advanced to Q15 minute checks.  Patient was 
unit-restricted.  There were no acute safety issues during this 
hospitalization.

LEGAL: ___
PSYCHIATRIC:
# Unspecified depressive disorder; cluster B traits.
On admission to the unit patient endorsed low mood, poor energy, 
minimal sleep and continued suicidal ideation with intrusive 
thoughts of worthlessness and a desire to cut herself.  She was 
continued on her home medication regimen (which she had not 
formerly been taking consistently) of Sertraline, Seroquel and 
Trazodone with additional trazodone available as needed for 
insomnia.  Her outpatient PCP (prescriber of psychiatric 
medications) and family members (father, fiancé) were contacted 
for collateral.  The patient was encouraged to implement coping 
strategies when intrusive thoughts or desires to self harm 
surfaced.  She was able to notify staff on several different 
occasions when she was feeling unsafe.  Over the course of her 
hospitalization she engaged in interpersonal, milieu and 
occupational therapy and exhibited a mild improvement in mood 
and slight decrease in intrusive thoughts. After medical 
stabilization, the patient was discharged to ___ 
___
Partial Hospital Program. 

# History of bulimia
Given patient's stable weight and clinical status, she was not 
placed on eating disorder protocol but was followed by nutrition 
and her PO intake was monitored.  She was noted to eat 
small-moderate portions of most meals with Ensure 
supplementation. Orthostatics were monitored as well as weekly 
labs and were within normal limits.  Patient initially did not 
report binging or purging behaviors for the first two weeks on 
the unit, however over her third weekend she endorced recent 
purging to the covering MD as well as OT.  She agreed to remain 
in the day room 60 minutes after finishing meals and to alert 
staff members w/ urges to purge or if feeling unsafe.  Repeat 
BMP stable. Patient continued to have recurring intrusive 
thoughts of purging until date of discharge, with no new 
reported episodes.

#Alcohol use d/o: Patient did not exhibit symptoms of simple or 
complex alcohol withdrawal while admitted. She was provided with 
daily thiamine, MVI and folate and was encouraged to attend unit 
AA/___ recovery meetings.  During her admission she was 
provided with alcohol cessation resources.

# Septic Shock: Patient found on inpatient psych unit with new 
fever to 103.1, with hypotension refractory to IVF 
resuscitation, and initial lactate mildly elevated. She was 
transferred to the ICU, placed on broad spectrum antibiotics for 
concern for intra-abdominal process given abdominal pain, 
cirrhosis. Bedside ultrasound without ascites, and also patient 
underwent CT scan which did not demonstrate any fluid 
collection, abscess or colitis. Throughout day 1 in ICU, patient 
continued to have increased pressor requirement, with worsening 
serial abdominal exams, and therefore underwent repeat CT scan 
which was concerning for a potentially ascending colitis. 
Patient was evaluated by surgery given prior history of I&D for 
abscess, and had more reassuring abdominal exams. She was 
initially placed on vancomycin, zosyn, and flagyl, and after 
clinical improvement was called out the regular medicine floor 
and remained stable on cipro/flagyl. She finished a 14d course 
of antibiotics on ___. 

# Abdominal Pain: Concern for acute intra-abdominal process 
given prior gastro-cutaneous fistula on CT scan previously, and 
recent I&D of abdominal wall abscess. Patient's abdominal exams 
were monitored in this setting, and improved as above. Repeat CT 
imaging suggestive of infectious colitis. ___ US showed small 
perihepatic ascites and no evidence of SBP. 

# Right pleural effusion: Patient found to have new oxygen 
requirement on admission, with prior demonstration of a right 
sided pleural effusion. Patient previously had undergone 
thoracentesis with studies supportive of a hepatic hydrothorax. 
Patient underwent bedside ultrasound which did not demonstrate 
any loculations of the fluid, and also underwent CT Torso for 
any infectious process source identification which demonstrated 
homogenous fluid. Shortness of breath has improved with diuresis 

and she was weaned to RA. Given unclear source of septic shock 
and large effusion, repeat thoracentesis was done on ___ and 
chest tube was placed ___. Patient's breathing improved 
after placement of chest tube. CXR ___ showed improvement of 
pleural effusion. Her fluid status was stable on PO diuretics at 
time of discharge. 

# Cirrhosis: Patient with prior diagnosis of cirrhosis ___ to 
ETOH, with recent admission for alcoholic hepatitis. Patient had 
recent EGD without evidence of varices, and LFTs trended while 
inpatient. She was started on spironolactone and Lasix, and will 
need her LFTS followed after discharge. 

#) Transaminitis: On the floor, patient had rising LFTs with AST 
predominance. Unclear etiology, could be from septic shock or 
secondary to infectious processes causing colitis. RUQ US shows 
small perihepatic ascites. No evidence of obstruction. Tbili 
remained elevated in setting of cirrhosis but downtrended. LFTs 
stable on discharge. Hepatitis serologies were negative. 
 
# Peptic Ulcer Disease s/p gastric bypass: Patient's bypass 
previously complicated by marginal ulcers, with prior gastritis 
only demonstrating gastritis previously. Patient had guiac 
negative while inpatient and was continued on home sucralfate 
and pantoprazole. 

# Anemia: Currently stable, patient with prior history of 
antibodies and therefore in future should be transfused with 
E-antigen negative blood products for all blood cell 
transfusions.

IMAGING/STUDIES:
======================
CT A/P ___. Gastro-cutaneous fistula extending from the native gastric 
antrum to the right upper quadrant as detailed above. 
2. Dysmorphic appearing liver and splenomegaly as detailed 
above, compatible with the known underlying cirrhosis and 
underlying portal hypertension.  Small amount of associated 
ascites has increased compared to prior evaluation.  Assessment 
for solid liver lesions is very limited due to lack of 
intravenous contrast. 
3. Large right pleural effusion, partially imaged but slightly 
worse as 
compared to prior, as detailed above. 

UGI Air w/ KUB ___
Attempts to cannulate the patient's cutaneous fistula were 
unsuccessful.  
Water-soluble contrast was administered by mouth, however the 
gastro cutaneous fistula was not opacified. 

KUB ___
Nonobstructive bowel gas pattern.

CT A/P ___. Postsurgical changes along the anterior abdominal wall 
reflecting recent I&D.  A gastrocutaneous tract is again 
demonstrated but is not definitely patent.  No new or drainable 
collections.  No hematoma. 
2. Cirrhotic liver. 
3. Mild ascites. 
4. Large right pleural effusion with near complete collapse of 
the right lower lobe, unchanged from prior. 

Chest PA ___
Interval recurrence of a previously drained moderate right 
pleural effusion. 
Stable mild cardiomegaly. 
Focal opacity overlying the left lateral chest likely represent 
osteochondroma or posttraumatic rib coalition. 

KUB ___. Nonobstructive bowel gas pattern. 
2. Assessment for free intraperitoneal air is limited on supine 
radiographs, however there is no gross pneumoperitoneum. If 
there is clinical concern for pneumoperitoneum, advise upright 
or left lateral decubitus radiograph. 

CT Chest ___.  Large nonhemorrhagic right pleural effusion causing near 
complete collapse of the right lower lobe, partial collapse of 
the middle lobe, and mild atelectasis in the right upper lobe. 
2.  Tiny left pleural effusion with mild basilar atelectasis. 

CT A/P ___. A gastrocutaneous fistulous tract from the excluded stomach 
in the biliary limb is once again re- demonstrated, with no 
evidence of fluid within the tract.  No drainable collections. 
2. Interval thickening of the cecum, ascending, and proximal 
transverse 
concerning for infectious colitis, possibly C. difficile. 
3. Cirrhotic liver.  Small to moderate volume ascites. 
4. Moderate to large volume right pleural effusion with 
associated near 
complete collapse of the right lower lobe.  Small left pleural 
effusion with associated mild subsegmental atelectasis, new from 
previous. 

CXR ___
In comparison with the study ___, there again is a 
substantial right layering pleural effusion with underlying 
compressive atelectasis.  However, there is substantial increase 
in opacification involving the left hemithorax.  
Although this could reflect development of a significant 
pneumonia, the discussion with Dr. ___ that the 
patient has no signs of infection clinically.  Therefore, it is 
much more likely that this is a manifestation of developing 
pulmonary edema, which is difficult to assess on the right side 
due to the overlying pleural effusion.  

RUQ US ___
No intra or extrahepatic ductal dilatation. 
Hepatic cirrhosis, and splenomegaly.  Small perihepatic ascites, 
and for this reason a location was not marked for paracentesis. 
Bilateral, right greater than left, pleural effusions. 

CXR ___. New pigtail catheter projects over the right right lower lung 
with a substantial interval decrease in right pleural effusion, 
now small with associated atelectasis. 
2. Trace right apical pneumothorax. 
3. Significant interval improvement in left-sided pulmonary 
edema, now mild. 

CXR ___
Comparison to ___.  Stable position of the right chest 
tube.  The tube has drained almost all of the pre-existing right 
pleural effusion.  Only a minimal amount of pleural effusion is 
visualized, projecting over the costophrenic sinus.  There is no 
evidence for the presence of a pneumothorax.  The lung volumes 
have decreased and the size of the cardiac silhouette is now at 
the upper range of normal.  No new focal parenchymal opacities.  
The right internal jugular vein catheter is in stable correct 
position. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ is a ___ year-old female with a history of roux-en-y 
gastric bypass ___ c/b marginal ulcerations, ETOH abuse, new 
cirrhosis, and bulimia who initially presented to with bulimia 
and depression admitted to inpatient psychiatry. Transferred to 
ICU for septic shock and acute onset abdominal pain of unclear 
etiology, but which improved with antibiotics and supportive 
care. Her course was also complicated by hepatic hydrothorax, 
which was stable after initial drainage and PO diuretics. She 
was medically cleared to return to inpatient psychiatry on ___. 
.
# Septic Shock: Patient found on inpatient psych unit with new 
fever to 103.1, with hypotension refractory to IVF 
resuscitation, and initial lactate mildly elevated. She was 
transferred to the ICU, placed on broad spectrum antibiotics for 
concern for intra-abdominal process given abdominal pain, 
cirrhosis. Bedside ultrasound without ascites, and also patient 
underwent CT scan which did not demonstrate any fluid 
collection, abscess or colitis. Throughout day 1 in ICU, patient 
continued to have increased pressor requirement, with worsening 
serial abdominal exams, and therefore underwent repeat CT scan 
which was concerning for a potentially ascending colitis. 
Patient was evaluated by surgery given prior history of I&D for 
abscess, and had more reassuring abdominal exams. She was 
initially placed on vancomycin, zosyn, and flagyl, and after 
clinical improvement was called out the regular medicine floor 
and remained stable on cipro/flagyl. She finished a 14d course 
of antibiotics on ___. 
. 
# Abdominal Pain: Concern for acute intra-abdominal process 
given prior gastro-cutaneous fistula on CT scan previously, and 
recent I&D of abdominal wall abscess. Patient's abdominal exams 
were monitored in this setting, and improved as above. Repeat CT 
imaging suggestive of infectious colitis. RUQ US showed small 
perihepatic ascites and no evidence of SBP. 
. 
# Right pleural effusion: Patient found to have new oxygen 
requirement on admission, with prior demonstration of a right 
sided pleural effusion. Patient previously had undergone 
thoracentesis with studies supportive of a hepatic hydrothorax. 
Patient underwent bedside ultrasound which did not demonstrate 
any loculations of the fluid, and also underwent CT Torso for 
any infectious process source identification which demonstrated 
homogenous fluid. Shortness of breath has improved with diuresis 
and she was weaned to RA. Given unclear source of septic shock 
and large effusion, repeat thoracentesis was done on ___ and 
chest tube was placed ___. Patient's breathing improved 
after placement of chest tube. CXR ___ showed improvement of 
pleural effusion. Her fluid status was stable on PO diuretics at 
time of discharge. 

# Cirrhosis: Patient with prior diagnosis of cirrhosis ___ to 
ETOH, with recent admission for alcoholic hepatitis. Patient had 
recent EGD without evidence of varices, and LFTs trended while 
inpatient. She was started on spironolactone and Lasix, and will 
follow up at the ___ after discharge. 

#) Transaminitis: On the floor, patient had rising LFTs with AST 
predominance. Unclear etiology, could be from septic shock or 
secondary to infectious processes causing colitis. RUQ US shows 
small perihepatic ascites. No evidence of obstruction.
Tbili remained elevated in setting of cirrhosis but downtrended. 
LFTs downtrended on discharge. Hepatitis serologies were 
negative. 

# Depression / Bulimia: Patient transferred from ___ 
inpatient psychiatry unit for depression and bulimia. Patient 
had passive SI on admission, and previously was on 1:1 sitter 
given high risk of purging. On examination, teeth are eroded 
likely ___ to chronic vomiting. Patient on admission did not 
have any SI/HI, and discussions with psychiatry stated does not 
require 1:1 sit at this point. When medically cleared, she was 
discharged back to inpatient psychiatry team. 
. 
# Alcohol use Disorder: Patient did not have any symptoms of 
alcohol withdrawal, and was continued on supportive care with 
thiamine, folate and multivitamin. 
. 
# Peptic Ulcer Disease s/p gastric bypass: Patient's bypass 
previously complicated by marginal ulcers, with prior gastritis 
only demonstrating gastritis previously. Patient had guiac 
negative while inpatient and was continued on home sucralfate 
and pantoprazole. 
. 
# Anemia: Currently stable, patient with prior history of 
antibodies and therefore in future should be transfused with 
E-antigen negative blood products for all blood cell 
transfusions.

Brief Hospital Course:
SAFETY:  The patient was placed on Q5 minute checks on admission 
and was gradually advanced to Q15 minute checks.  Patient was 
unit-restricted.  There were no acute safety issues during this 
hospitalization.

LEGAL: ___
PSYCHIATRIC:
# Unspecified depressive disorder; cluster B traits: On 
admission to the unit patient endorsed low mood, poor energy, 
minimal sleep and continued suicidal ideation with intrusive 
thoughts of worthlessness and a desire to cut herself.  She was 
continued on her home medication regimen (which she had not 
formerly been taking consistently) of Sertraline, Seroquel and 
Trazodone with additional trazodone available as needed for 
insomnia.  Her outpatient PCP (prescriber of psychiatric 
medications) and family members (father, fiancé) were contacted 
for collateral.  The patient was encouraged to implement coping 
strategies when intrusive thoughts or desires to self harm 
surfaced.  She was able to notify staff on several different 
occasions when she was feeling unsafe.  Over the course of her 
hospitalization she engaged in interpersonal, milieu and 
occupational therapy and exhibited a mild improvement in mood 
and slight decrease in intrusive thoughts. Plan for patient was 
to aid in transfer to out patient services for eating disorder 
treatment while remaining as inpatient until arrangements could 
be made, however patient developed acute infectious process and 
had to be transferred to the medical service.

# History of bulimia
Given patient's stable weight and clinical status, she was not 
placed on eating disorder protocol but was followed by nutrition 
and her PO intake was monitored.  She was noted to eat 
small-moderate portions of most meals with Ensure 
supplementation. Orthostatics were monitored as well as weekly 
labs and were within normal limits.  Patient initially did not 
report binging or purging behaviors for the first two weeks on 
the unit, however over her third weekend she endorced recent 
purging to the covering MD as well as OT.  She agreed to remain 
in the day room 30 minutes after finishing meals and to alert 
staff members w/ urges to purge or if feeling unsafe.  Repeat 
BMP stable. Patient continued to have recurring intrusive 
thoughts of purging until date of transfer, with no new reported 
episodes.

#Alcohol use d/o: Patient did not exhibit symptoms of simple or 
complex alcohol withdrawal while on Deaconess 4.  She was 
provided with daily thiamine, MVI and folate and was encouraged 
to attend unit AA/___ recovery meetings.  During her admission 
she was provided with alcohol cessation resources.

___ MEDICAL CONDITIONS:
#Abdominal pain: Following her transfer from medicine the 
patient reported continued epigastric and RUQ abdominal pain.  
She also developed new abdominal pain related to a mass on the 
anterior right aspect of her abdomen underneath a prior surgical 
scar.  Medicine and surgery were consulted and felt it was most 
consistent with an abscess.  She was briefly transferred to 
Acute Care Surgery on ___ for I&D of the abscess and then 
transferred back to Deac4.  After the I&D, a fistulogram was 
performed which did not reveal a gastrocutaneous fistula, 
however surgery had suspicion that a fistula had formed btwn the 
abscess and the stomach remnant, which would not have been seen 
on the fistulogram.  Wound drainage and surrounding skin 
irritation was managed with placement of an ostomy bag and 
barrier cream. On the evening of ___, the patient developed 
acute abdominal pain, nausea, fever to ___, and chills. Stat 
labs and imaging were obtain, medicine and surgery were 
consulted and the patient was transferred to the medical floor 
for further management.

#Cirrhosis: Patient was diagnosed with cirrhosis, likely ___ 
ETOH use while on medicine prior to Deac4 admission.  The 
patient was continued on the same medications and will have 
follow-up in hepatology and ___ clinic.

#PUD/s/p gastric bypass: Bypass also complicated by marginal 
ulcers, only gastritis seen on EGD during medicine admission.  
Pt was continued on Sucralfate and Pantoprazole.

#R pleural effusion: Pleural studies are consistent with hepatic 
hydrothorax per medicine discharge note.  Patient was continued 
on the medication regimen started prior to admission and will 
schedule f/u in ___ weeks in ___ clinic.

#Anemia: During medicine admission patient showed no signs of 
active bleeding. Responded appropriately to 1U PRBC. Found to 
have antibodies, likely from prior
transfusions. Suspect anemia primarily due to acute illness and 
likely underlying anemia of chronic disease due to cirrhosis vs 
slow oozing from gastritis. CBC improved throughout admission- 
repeat CBC at next clinic appointment. In the future the patient 
should receive E-antigen negative products for all red cell 
transfusions. Approximately 71% of ABO compatible blood will be 
E-antigen negative.

#Leukopenia: Likely due to underlying cirrhosis, has been stable 
to improving.
 
#Thrombocytopenia: Stable to improving, likely due to underlying 
cirrhosis. 

#Focal nodular opacity overlying the ___ lateral ribs seen 
to move separate from the ribs on oblique radiographs suggesting 
that it is pleural and may represent a pleural plaque. Repeat PA 
and lateral chest radiograph in 3 months is recommended for 
follow-up. Separate letter sent to PCP by medicine.
 
PSYCHOSOCIAL:
#) GROUPS/MILIEU: Patient was encouraged to participate in the 
unit’s groups/milieu/therapy opportunities. Use of coping skills 
and mindfulness/relaxation methods were encouraged. Therapy 
addressed family/social/work issues.

#) COLLATERAL CONTACTS/FAMILY CONTACTS:
Collateral was obtained from father, fiancé and PCP.

#) INTERVENTIONS:
- Medications: continued home psychiatric medications (Zoloft, 
Seroquel, trazodone)
- Psychotherapeutic Interventions: Individual, group, and milieu 
therapy.
- Coordination of aftercare: by social work, MDs, RNs and

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___, 

You were admitted with abdominal pain after an alcohol binge and 
a suicide attempt. You were diagnosed with alcoholic hepatitis, 
an inflammation of your liver. This causes abnormal liver 
function tests and pain, and can take a time to resolve. 

Your underlying liver disease caused fluid buildup around your 
lung, and you were started on medications to help keep that 
fluid from affecting your breathing. 

Your urine copper test is still pending in the lab, please make 
sure to follow up with the liver clinic. 

You are being transferred to an inpatient psych facility to help 
treat your depression and eating disorder. 

We wish you all the best.
