IMAGING/STUDIES:
=====================
ECG (___): 
Baseline artifact, likely sinus tachycardia. Early transition of 
R waves in the precordium. Possible Q waves in leads III and 
aVF, although baseline artifact precludes accurate 
interpretation which does raise the possibility of old inferior 
myocardial infarction, although this may just be obscured by
noise. Compared to the previous tracing there is significantly 
more baseline artifact. Repeat tracing is suggested.

CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST (___):
IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial process.

CT C-SPINE W/O CONTRAST (___):
IMPRESSION:
1.  No acute fracture. Anteriolisthesis of T1 on T2 could be 
degenerative in nature, but recommend clinical correlation for 
location of pain.
2.  Severe degenerative changes throughout the cervical spine.

LEFT KNEE XRAY (___):
FINDINGS:  AP, oblique, and lateral views of the left knee.  The 
bones are diffusely osteopenic.  Tricompartmental degenerative 
changes are noted with joint space loss and osteophyte 
formation.  There is no acute fracture.  Dense atherosclerotic 
calcifications are noted.  There may be a small supra patellar 
joint effusion.
IMPRESSION:  Degenerative changes without acute fracture.

CXR ___: IMPRESSION:  No definite acute cardiopulmonary 
process.

C-SPINE TRAUMA W/FLEX & EXT 5 VIEWS (___):
IMPRESSION:  Although C7 is not evaluated on the current study, 
no definite acute fractures are seen.  Severe degenerative 
change within the lower cervical spine.

R KNEE XRAY (___): FINDINGS: 
No acute fractures or dislocations are seen.There are severe 
degenerative changes with bone-on-bone contact within the medial 
compartment. Large spurs are seen within all 3 compartments. 
Chondrocalcinosis is identified.There is no knee joint effusion. 
There are extensive vascular calcifications.
IMPRESSION: Severe degenerative changes worse within the medial 
compartment.
 
Brief Hospital Course:
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: ___ with h/o breast cancer s/p simple 
mastectomy in ___, admitted s/p mechanical fall and with 
UTI.

# s/p fall: Mechanical fall.  Per staff at patient's living 
facility, fall was unwitnessed.  Patient was found in the AM in 
sitting position in the bathroom.  Patient denied LOC. C-spine 
cleared by imaging in ED, CT head w/out acute process.  No 
fractures seen on knee and chest X-rays.  Patient with 
difficulty on ambulation, likely secondary to degenerative joint 
disease in knees bilaterally and deconditioning.   Patient seen 
by ___, recommended dc to rehab.

# UTI: U/A c/w UTI.  Is complicated as patient w/ history of 
diabetes.  Received macrobid in the ED, started on IV CTX on 
medical  floor empirically.  Urine culture grew pan-sensitive 
e.coli.  Antibiotic regimen changed to Bactrim DS BID.  
Discharged on Bactrim DS to complete 7 day course of 
antibiotics.

# NIDDM: Held metformin while inpatient.  Was kept HISS while 
inpatient.  Sugars were well-controlled.

# HTN: Continued home Hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg po daily.  On 
Irbesartan 225 mg at home, however this was non-formulary, given 
losartan in its place.  BPs was largely well-controlled.

# HLD: Continue home simvastatin 20 mg daily.

# Osteoporosis: Continue home vitamin D and calcium.  Continued 
home Alendronate 70 mg q saturda

# Glaucoma: Continued home eye drops.

# GERD: Continue home prilosec

# Depression: Continue home sertraline.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
=====================
# s/p fall: no acute fractures.  fall was unwitnessed.  Likely 
related to poor mobility, deconditioning.  Was seen by ___, 
recommended discharge to rehab.  Will follow up with orthopedics 
for management of degenerative disk disease.

# urinary tract infection: UCx with E.coli, pan sensitive.  Was 
initially treated with IV Ceftriaxone.  Converted to Bactrim.  
Will discharge on 5 days of Bactrim DS BID (last day of 
antibiotics ___.

# CODE: DNR/DNI 
# EMERGENCY CONTACT: ___ (daughter): ___
