CARDIAC CATHETERIZATION ___:
Coronary angiography:  right dominant
LMCA:  20% distal stenosis
LAD:  Proximal 80% stenosis diffuse.  Mild luminal 
irregularities
LCX:  Mild luminal irregularities
RCA:  Proximal diffuse 80% stenosis
Interventional details
Right radial access could not be obtained due to vessel spasm. 
Change for 6 ___ XBLAD3.5 guide.  Crossed with a Prowater 
wire.  Predilated with a 2.5 mm balloon.  Deployed a 2.75 x 28 
mm Promus Element drug-eluting stent and postdilated the 
proximal portion with a 3.0 mm balloon.  Final angiography 
revealed normal flow, no dissection and 0% residual stenosis in 
the stent. Origin jailed diagonal had 70% stenosis and normal 
flow so thus was not rescued.  Attention was then turned to the 
RCA.  A 6 ___ JR4 guide was used.  A Prowater wire crossed.  
A 2.75 x 18mm Resolute stent was deployed.  Final angiography 
revealed normal flow, no dissection and 0% residual stenosis in 
the stent. The patient tolerated the procedure well and left the 
laboratory in stable condition.  The right common femoral 
arteriotomy was closed with an Angioseal device.
