___ Preop Chest x-ray:
 The ___ catheter is visualized with tip ___ SVC. The lungs 
are 
hyperexpanded with some blunting of the CP angles but no 
effusion. Compared to the reference exam, the effusions have 
decreased. There is no focal infiltrate. Cardiac and mediastinal 
silhouettes are normal. 
___ pathology
1.  Peritoneal implant (A):
Metastatic adenocarcinoma, consistent with gynecologic origin; 
see note.
2.  Omental implant (B-E):
Metastatic adenocarcinoma, consistent with gynecologic origin.
Note: The tumor cells stain positively for cytokeratin cocktail, 
CK7, ___, and WT-1.  They are negative for CK20, CDX2, 
calretinin, B72.3, and are null for p53.  Controls are adequate. 
 
___ Pathology
Peritoneal fluid, cell block:  Positive for malignant cells, 
consistent with mucinous adenocarcinoma; see note; also see 
cytology (C12-15047P).  
Note: Tumor cells are immunoreactive for CK7, WT-1, ___, and 
EMA, and very focally positive for estrogen receptor and PAX-2.  
They are negative for CK20, CDX-2, mammoglobin, GCDFP, 
progesterone receptor, TTF-1, calretinin, desmin, D2-40, 
absorbed CEA, and B72.3.  This immunoprofile is nonspecific, but 
is consistent with an epithelial phenotype and raises the 
possibility of an ovarian primary. A preliminary diagnosis was 
e-mailed to Dr. ___ on ___ at 2:___.
___ Peritoneal washing: 
___ Positive for malignant cells, consistent with mucinous 
adenocarcinoma.
KUB Upright
Nonspecific bowel gas pattern with residual oral contrast ___ the 

ascending colon.  Partial or early bowel obstruction cannot be 
excluded on this study.  If there is clinical concern for early 
bowel obstruction, CT can be considered. 
___ CT abd and pelvis 
1.  Dilated proximal small bowel with transition point proximal 
to the ostomy, concerning for small bowel obstruction. CT 
appearance suggests prior gastrojejunostomies with dilation of 
both efferent and afferent limbs proximal to the transition 
point ___ the mid to low abdomen. 
2.  Moderate amount of ascites with peritoneal enhancement and 
omental 
stranding consistent with known peritoneal carcinomatosis. 
3.  Esophageal catheter tip terminating just below the 
gastroesophageal 
junction.  Advancing the catheter is recommended. 
4.  Air ___ the bladder, likely secondary to recent 
instrumentation, but 
clinical correlation is recommended. 
5.  Dense retained contrast ___ the colon and stool ___ the 
rectum. 
6.  Narrowing of the transverse colon with masslike mural 
thickening. 
CT Chest with contrast ___ 
1.  Multiple areas of subpleural nodularity may represent 
scarring, but 
malignancy is not excluded.  Recommend 3-month follow-up CT to 
assess for 
stability. 
2.  Presbyesophagus. 
CXR ___ 
___ catheter tip is at the level of mid low SVC.  Heart size 
and 
mediastinum are unremarkable.  The NG tube tip is ___ the 
stomach.  Lungs are essentially clear except for fibronodular 
opacities ___ the apices.  No interval development of pleural 
effusion or pneumothorax is seen. 
CT abd/pelvis ___
IMPRESSION: 
1.  No evidence of acute abdominal process to explain the 
patient's pain 
without evidence of obstruction given free flow of contrast into 
the distal 
small bowel, though persistent relative distention of the 
proximal versus 
distal small bowel is noted. 
2.  Stranding ___ the mesentery and omentum, compatible with 
known metastatic 
ovarian cancer with changes from prior gastrojejunostomy and 
diverting loop 
ileostomy noted. 
3.  Moderate volume of free pelvic fluid.

Brief Hospital Course:
___ year old female with pmhx of gastroparesis requiring ___ years 
of TPN, Type 2 Diabetes, and pseudo-obstruction presenting with 
abdominal carcinomatosis with primary likely mucinous 
adenocarcinoma of the ovary now s/o ileostomy on ___ with 
continues N/v with NG ___ place. 

SURGICAL COURSE ___
Ms. ___ was admitted on ___ under the Acute Care 
Surgical service. She was taken urgently to the operating room 
for an exploratory laparotomy with lysis of adhesions,biopsy of 
peritoneal and omental implants and loop ileostomy creation. 
Please see operative note by Dr. ___ details of the 
procedure. The patient was awakened, extubated, and transferred 
to PACU ___ satisfactory condition. She was later transferred to 
the surgical floor ___ stable condition.

She was kept NPO postoperatively with IV fluids. TPN was 
continued and blood sugars were monitored and controlled with an 
insulin sliding scale. A nasogastric tube was left ___ place 
postoperatively and removed on POD#2. On POD#3 she began having 
ileostomy output. On POD#4 her diet was advanced as tolerated to 
her baseline oral intake and her TPN was continued. Her 
ileostomy output began to pick up to about 1 liter for 24 hours. 
On POD#5 she appeared more distended with minimal ileostomy 
output and nausea and her diet was decreased to clear liquids.
  
A foley catheter was placed for urine output monitoring 
periooperatively and removed on POD#3 at which time she voided 
without difficulty. However, on POD#4 she was noted to have 
increased urgency and frequency and a urinalysis was obtained 
which was positive and she was started on 3 days of cipro while 
cultures were pending.

Her vital signs were routinely monitored and she remained 
afebrile and hemodynamically stable. She was placed on standing 
IV lopressor for history of WPW syndrome. She was initially 
restarted on her home dose of coumadin on POD#2; however the 
decision was made to hold her coumadin per Dr. ___ a 
history of maintaining a therapeutic INR and she was placed on 
SC heparin TID for prophylaxis. Incentive spirometry and 
pulmonary toileting were encourged. Her pain level was routinely 
assessed and medications were adjusted as needed. She reported 
having intermittent muscle spasms and was started on PO 
tizanidine. On POD#4 she was transitioned from IV pain 
medication to PO.

Physical therapy was consulted to evaluate her mobility and she 
was encouraged to mobilize out of bed.

Tumor markers were sent on admission and Ca-125 came back 
significantly elevated at 162, likely consistent with ovarian 
cancer. This was relayed to both the patient and her daughter. 
CEA was within normal limits at 1.3 and ___ was 7.  
Pathology results returned and were consistent with ovarian 
cancer. 

MEDICINE COURSE ___

#  Obstruction due to metastatic disease: The patient presented 
after loop ileostomy with NGT ___ place, draining bilious fluid 
and tolerating only minimal clear fluids. She developed nausea 
with clamping of the NGT on ___ and it was placed back 
on suction, draining ~ 500-1000 cc ___ 24 hours. Abd is soft, + 
BS and ileostomy is draining brownish fluid.  Due to the burden 
of her disease, a G tube would be technically difficult at this 
time.  ___ order to reduce the dysmotility issues caused by the 
metastatic disease and her requirement for the NGT, we have 
proceeded with carboplatin to debulk on 3 week cycle, received 
one cycle while ___ house. She did have nausea but it responded 
well to Zofran and Compazine. The patient had spasms of pain ___ 
her lower pelvis and ___ her lower back, this was ___ontrolled with morphine IV. Transition to long-acting or PO 
medication is advised; at the time of discharge, this was not 
done as the patient's pain medication requirement was still 
fluctuating day to day (as much as 12mg IV morphine ___ 24 hours 
and as little as 6mg IV morphine ___ 24 hours within the days 
prior to discharge, so if her pain requirement increases 
substantially then this may be worth investigating).

# E. Coli UTI: Cultures returned on ___ with E.coli with multi 
drug resistance, but sensitivity to macrodantin (avoided because 
patient's PO absorption is likely poor), and cephalosporins 
(avoided because patient reports history of hives to 
cephalosporins and penicillins) so meropenem was initiated on 
___ and planned for 10 day course. Prior to this, the patient 
was treated with 5 days of PO Cipro, then transitioned to IV 
Cipro on Day 6 out of concern for malabsorption. The patient was 
symptomatic, with urge, frequency and dysuria despite days of 
treatment, and urine cultures x2 were contaminated. Frequency 
and urgency may be also ___ burden of pelvic metastatic disease.

# Contrast extravasation:  Of note, she did have extravasation 
of IV contrast with CT done on ___, plastics was consulted and 
the patient had her arm elevated with complete resolution of the 
area of erythema and edema on the R UE, distal to antecubital 
fossa.  Plastics had no further recommendations.

# Back Pain: she notes that her low back pain seems to be 
positional, over the muscle without any pain over the spinous 
process- ___ addition ovarian CA is less likely to cause mets to 
bone, so no need to for further image at this time. Will cont to 
close monitor and treat her pain. ___ consider obtain thoracic 
spine MRI if symptoms persist or worsen

# SVC Thrombosis: port initially was withdrawing only 
sluggishly, but improved to normal withdrawal after TPA dwelled 
for 12 hours. Changed from warfarin to Lovenox BID

#  Mucinous Adenocarcinoma of the Ovary: patient says that her 
goal is to get home. She is not getting Taxol out of concern for 
wound healing, but she did receive one dose of Carboplatin, plan 
is for taxol ___ the future.

CHRONIC CARE
#  Type II Diabetes: Not truly diagnosed and BG has consistently 
been less than 150 while ___ house.

# Wolf ___ White: pt has intermittent tachycardia, per her 
report, which has been completely controlled with metoprolol, so 
this was cont while ___ house.
