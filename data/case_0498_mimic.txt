Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the General Surgical Service on 
___ for evaluation and treatment of the aforementioned 
complaint.  On ___, the patient underwent  exploratory 
laparotomy with ___ patch and EGD, which went well without 
complication (reader referred to the Operative Note for 
details). After a brief, uneventful stay in the PACU, the 
patient arrived on the floor NPO, on IV fluids, with a foley 
catheter and JP drain in place, and a Morphine PCA for pain 
control.  She was started on empiric IV Zosyn and Fluconazole. 
The patient was hemodynamically stable.
.
Neuro: The patient used the Morphine PCA with good effect and 
adequate pain control.  When tolerating oral intake, the patient 
was transitioned to oral pain medications with continued good 
effect.
.
CV: While NPO, the patient was placed on Metoprolol IV for 
hypertension with good effect. When able to tolerate a diet, she 
was changed back to home dose of Atenolol. On POD#8, the patient 
experienced a transient run of V-Tach on telemetry. She was 
asymptomatic, denying any chest pain, SOB, lightheadedness or 
fatigue. An ECG and cardiac enzymes were unremarkable. 
Electrolytes were notable for a potassium of 2.9. She received 
repletement without further episode of V-Tach or other 
arrythmia. The patient remained stable from a cardiovascular 
standpoint; vital signs were routinely monitored.
.
Pulmonary: Post-operatively, the patient experienced mild 
bibasilar rales and continued oxygen demand. A CXR revealed 
bibasilar atelectasis. She was started on Albuterol/Atrovent 
nebulizer treatments and aggressive respiratory toilet was 
emphasized with good response. The patient remained stable from 
a pulmonary standpoint; vital signs were routinely monitored. 
Good pulmonary toilet, early ambulation and incentive 
spirrometry were encouraged throughout hospitalization.
.
GI/GU/FEN: Post-operatively, the patient was made NPO with IV 
fluids. On POD#1, she required a total IV fluid bolus of 1 liter 
for low urine output with good response. The NG tube was 
retained until POD#5. Once discontinued, the patient was started 
on sips. Diet was progressively advanced as tolerated to regular 
by POD#8. The foley catheter was discontinued on POD#2; the 
patient was subsequently able to void without problem. Patient's 
intake and output were closely monitored, and IV fluid was 
adjusted when necessary.  Electrolytes were routinely followed, 
and repleted when necessary. The JP was discontinued on POD#8.
.
ID: Post-operatively, the patient was empirically started on IV 
Zosyn and Fluconazole. Zosyn was discontinued on POD#7. The 
patient will complete a total of 14 days of Fluconazole, with 6 
days remaining at discharge. On POD#2, the Helicobacter pylori 
antibody test was returned positive. When able to take PO 
intake, the patient was started on treatment of the H. pylori 
consisting on a two week course of Amoxacillin 1000mg PO BID, 
Clarithromycin 500mg PO BID, and Protonix 40mg BID. The 
patient's white blood count and fever curves were closely 
watched for signs of infection.  The midline incision with 
staples remained clean and intact. Staples will be due to be 
removed on ___.
.
Endocrine: The patient's blood sugar was monitored throughout 
his stay; sliding scale insulin dosing was adjusted accordingly. 
She did not require exogenous insulin at discharge. She was 
continued on her home dose of Levothyroxine 112mcg daily.
.
Hematology: The patient's complete blood count was examined 
routinely; no transfusions were required.
.
Prophylaxis: The patient received subcutaneous heparin and 
venodyne boots were used during this stay; was encouraged to get 
up and ambulate as early as possible.
.
At the time of discharge, the patient was doing well, afebrile 
with stable vital signs.  The patient was tolerating a regular 
diet, ambulating with assistance, voiding without assistance, 
and pain was well controlled.  She was discharged to an extended 
care facility. The patient received discharge teaching and 
follow-up instructions with understanding verbalized and
