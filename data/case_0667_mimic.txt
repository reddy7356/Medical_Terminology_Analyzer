Chest pain

History of Present Illness:
Mr. ___ is a ___ year old man with no significant past 
medical history. Over the last year, he has noted chest 
discomfort mainly associated with eating. He will eat something 
and have significant belching. He initially attributed his

just drove from ___ a few days ago (18hr journey over two 
days in the car) to visit family in ___. His 
daughter-in-law is an internist and he asked her about his 
symptoms yesterday and she said he should take a baby aspirin 
and if the pain came back he should go get checked out. His 
symptoms recurred and were associated with diaphoresis and 
nausea. He presented to the emergency department for further 
evaluation. His EKG revealed Q
waves in II/III/avF and his troponin was 1.7. He was admitted 
for further evaluation. A cardiac catheterization demonstrated 
multivessel coronary artery disease. He was referred to Dr. ___ 
___ surgical revascularization.

Transthoracic Echocardiogram 
The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall 
thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There is mild regional 
left ventricular systolic dysfunction with hypokinesis of the 
basal to mid inferior wall and mid inferolateral wall. The 
remaining segments contract normally (LVEF = 50 %). Overall left 
ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50-55%). 
Doppler parameters are most consistent with normal left 
ventricular diastolic function. The right ventricular cavity is 
mildly dilated with normal free wall contractility. The 
ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) 
are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Trace 
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are 
mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) 
mitral regurgitation is seen. The estimated pulmonary artery 
systolic pressure is normal. There is no pericardial effusion. 

IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Regional left ventricular 
systolic dysfunction c/w CAD. Normal right ventricular cavity 
size and systolic function. Mild right ventricular cavity 
dilation with preserved systolic function. Mild mitral 
regurgitation. Mild ascending aorta dilation.  

Cardiac Catheterization 
Dominance: Right
The LMCA had no angiographically apparent CAD. The LAD is 
diffusely diseased with 40% stenosis and
80% stenosis after D1. The distal mid vessel segment had 80% 
stenosis. The distal LAD had mild diffuse disease. The Cx has 
Mid vessel 60% stenosis after OM1. The OM1 has proximal 50% 
stenosis
and the OM2 is small with origin 80% stenosis. The RCA had 
diffuse disease proximal 60-70% stenosis and distal 70% stenosis 
and diffuse 70-80% stenosis in the PDA. The PL is small with 
proximal 60%
stenosis.

TEE ___- Intra-op TEE, preliminary report:
Conclusions   
 Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left 
ventricular cavity size is normal. There is mild regional left 
ventricular systolic dysfunction with 50-55%. The inferior and 
inferoseptal wall is dyskinetic.. Right ventricular chamber size 
and free wall motion are normal. The right ventricular cavity is 
mildly dilated There is no aortic valve stenosis. Mild (1+) 
aortic regurgitation is seen. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is 
seen. There is no pericardial effusion. There is small pleural 
effusion on the left side.The htoracic aorta is normal in 
diameter.
 Post bypass
 The LVEF is 50-55%.The inferour wall is still dyskinetic. The 
right ventricular function is normal the right ventricle is 
mildly dilated.The rest of the exam is unchanged.The thoracic 
aorta is intact.

Brief Hospital Course:
He was admitted on ___ and underwent routine preoperative 
testing and evaluation. He remained hemodynamically stable and 
was taken to the operating room on ___. He underwent 
coronary artery bypass grafting x 4. Please see operative note 
for full details. He tolerated the procedure well and was 
transferred to the CVICU in stable condition for recovery and 
invasive monitoring. 
  
 He weaned from sedation, awoke neurologically intact and was 
extubated on POD 1. He was weaned from inotropic and vasopressor 
support. Beta blocker was initiated and he was diuresed toward 
his preoperative weight. He remained hemodynamically stable and 
was transferred to the telemetry floor for further recovery. He 
was evaluated by the physical therapy service for assistance 
with strength and mobility. By the time of discharge on POD 4 he 
was ambulating, yet deconditioned, the wound was healing, and 
pain was controlled with oral analgesics. He was discharged to 
___ Rehab in good condition with appropriate follow 
up instructions.
