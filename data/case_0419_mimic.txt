Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
ERCP ___

 
History of Present Illness:
As per HPI by admitting MD: 

___ with hx of htn, osteoarthritis of knee, HLD presenting with 
painless jaundice and pruritis x1 month. 

Pt recalls onset of darkening urine ___ months prior to 
presentation, with associated lighter stools. One month prior to 
presentation, urine looked like "dark steeped tea," and stool 
was "very pale yellow." Around that time, his wife also noticed 
that his sclera were yellow.

In addition to jaundice, he has had progressive, severe 
pruritis, for which he has tried benadryl, cholestyramine 
without significant relief. Pruritis has interfered with sleep, 
work; he is unable to talk on the phone ___ pruritis, or drive. 
Over the past ___ months, he has had both intentional and 
unintentional weight loss; he reports working out, bicycling in 
an attempt to lose weight, lost 15 lbs, then another 20 lb 
although he had stopped trying. In total, he thinks 293 lbs->261 
lbs. Endorses some chills, diaphoresis overnight, which he has 
attributed to severe pruritis. 

Denies headaches, chest pain, SOB. He has noticed intermittent 
loose stools, but on day of presentation notes mild 
constipation. Denies dysuria, hematuria, noted bilateral ___ 
edema in ___ which has since resolved. He also reports 
ibuprofen 600 mg q4h x1.5 months in ___ for knee pain.

Pt initially presented to his PCP ___ ___ for evaluation of 
above symptoms. At that time, labs were notable for ALT 353, AST 
152, Alk phos 469, Tbili 6.7. RUQ u/s was ordered, and was done 
on ___ revealed "top normal size of CBD at 7 mm." Hepatitis 
A Ab positive, hepatitis A IgM negative. MRCP was ordered, and 
was referred to GI for further evaluation. He was seen by GI on 
___, at which time repeat labs revealed Tbili 13.2, Dbili 
8.2, ALT 124, AST 60. LKM-1 IgG, AMA negative, AFP 2.1, INR 1.5, 
Ceruloplasmin 54.5 (WNL), CMV IgG and IgM negative, EBV IgG 
positive, HBsAb negative, HBsAg negative. Per GI note dated 
___, assessment at that time was: "Given the negative viral 
hepatitis profile (a,b,c), I will broaden the search including 
CMV, EBV, and HSV, as well as other autoimmune etiologies and 
inherent conditions. I also discussed with patient about the 
rare and unlikelihood of fulminant hepatitis with liver failure, 
in which case inpatient management and possible liver 
transplantation may be necessary. The pruritus is not uncommon 
given hyperbilirubinemia, and I will prescribed Atarax. 
Regarding the epigastric abdominal pain, which may be irritation 
of the stomach/gastritis from his ibuprofen use. I will also 
prescribe ranitidine, which has antihistamine property, which 
may potentially help with the pruritus as well. I indicated the 
need to monitor his situation closely to ensure that he does not 
eat all into hepatic failure." 

On ___, Tbili had increased from 13.2 to 15.6. Pt called PCP 
to discuss terrible, refractory pruritis, and was directed to 
the ED for admission to hepatology service.

CEA 2.9, INR 1.5

Brief Hospital Course:
___ with hx of htn, osteoarthritis of knee, HLD presenting with 
painless jaundice and pruritis x1 month, found to have biliary 
ductal dilatation and ?soft tissue mass at ampulla, concerning 
for malignancy. 

# Pruritis: 
# Biliary obstruction: 
Progressive Tbili elevation and pruritis, painless jaundice, 
with CT evidence of biliary ductal dilatation and concern for 
ampullary soft tissue mass. No fever or leukocytosis to raise 
concern for acute cholangitis, although he is at high risk for 
infectious complications of biliary obstruction. Underwent 
EUS/ERCP with successful placement of plastic CBD stent along 
with brushings and biopsy of ampullary mass lesion. Will require 
close outpatient follow up to discuss results of pathology and 
coordination of next steps in management. He will also likely 
need staging CT chest to evaluate for metastatic disease but 
this was deferred until pathology confirms malignancy and will 
need to be done as an outpatient. For pruritis, his 
cholestyramine was increased to BID and he was advised to apply 
a topical lotion such as Sarna for itching. As T bili trends 
down this is expected to improve. ___ continue hydroxyzine PRN 
and Benadryl PRN (over the counter). 

# HLD: Atorvastatin was d/ced as outpatient when LFT elevation 
noted. This was held upon d/c again. 

# HTN: continue home amlodipine

# Severe malnutrition - in the context of acute illness. Would 
benefit from outpatient nutrition support. 

# Misc: takes various OTC supplements. Advised to discontinue 
all for the time being since it is unclear what may affect the 
liver.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,

It was a priviliege to care for you at the ___ 
___. You were admitted for severe itching due to 
blockage of your biliary system by a mass. You underwent stent 
placement to bypass the blockage which will allow your bilirubin 
to decrease and lead to resolution of your itching. You had a 
biopsy taken of the mass and the results are pending at 
discharge. You will have close follow up to discuss these 
results as well as the next steps. 

Your itching should improve as your labwork improves. Please 
continue cholestyramine twice a day (instead of once a day) to 
help with symptoms. You may also apply a lotion such as Sarna or 
a gentle cream/lotion to help with symptoms. If you have 
difficulty sleeping at night you may try an over the counter 
medication such as Melatonin or Benadryl. You may also continue 
to take Hydroxyzine for itching. Please try not to drive or 
operate a motor vehicle if you opt for a sedating medication 
such as Benadryl. 

At the time of discharge your labwork is as follows:
Total bilirubin 16.7, ALT 68, AST 59, ALP 364, INR 1.6
IgG subclasses and ___ are pending.
Your pathology is pending as well, our ERCP team will contact 
you with results when they are available.

Please call your PCP to make an appointment early this week and 
have your liver tests repeated. Please continue to take all 
medications as prescribed and follow up with all appointments as 
detailed below. 

We wish you the best! 

Sincerely,
Your ___ team

was negative for consolidations, and blood/urine cultures were 
negative. Patient continue to spike fever and he underwent 
abdominal CT on POD 5.

JP amylase was sent ___ the evening of  POD#6; the JP was 
discontinued on POD#7 as the output and amylase level were low.
