extremity fistula
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
   fistulogram and thrombectomy
Final Report
INDICATION:  ___ MALE WITH SUSPECTED TO BE THROMBOSED 
LEFT UPPER
EXTREMITY FISTULA. ON PHYSICAL EXAM THERE IS A FAINT THRILL AT 
THE
ANASTOMOSIS.
 COMPARISON:  Fistulogram and thrombectomy from ___.
 TECHNIQUE:  OPERATORS: Dr. ___ radiology 
fellow) and Dr.
___ radiology attending) performed the 
procedure. The
attending, Dr. ___ was present and supervising throughout 
the procedure.
ANESTHESIA: Moderate sedation was provided by administrating 
divided doses of
100mcg of fentanyl and 1 mg of midazolam throughout the total 
intra-service
time of 1 hour 30 minutes during which the patient's hemodynamic 
parameters
were continuously monitored by an independent trained radiology 
nurse. 1%
lidocaine was injected in the skin and subcutaneous tissues 
overlying the
access site.
MEDICATIONS: Fentanyl, Versed
CONTRAST: 85 ml of Optiray contrast.
FLUOROSCOPY TIME AND DOSE: 25.5 min, 41 mGy
 PROCEDURE:  1. Left upper extremity AV fistulogram.
2. Axillary, subclavian and superior vena cava venography.
3. Balloon angioplasty of the cephalic arch stenosis 
(recurrent).
4. Balloon angioplasty of the juxta- anastomotic area of 
stenosis (recurrent).
 PROCEDURE DETAILS:
Written informed consent was obtained from the patient outlining 
the risks,
benefits and alternatives to the procedure. The patient was then 
brought to
the angiography suite and placed supine on the image table with 
the left
upperextremity abducted and stabilized. Clinical examination 
demonstrated a
faint thrill at the anastomosis of the  brachiocephalic fistula 
in the left
upper extremity. The left upper extremity was prepped and draped 
in the usual
sterile fashion. A pre-procedure timeout and huddle was 
performed as per ___
protocol.
 Following administration of 1% lidocaine antegrade (directed 
towards the
venous outflow) access into the cephalic vein was obtained using 
a 21G
micropuncture needle under palpatory guidance. An 0.018 wire was 
then advanced
into the outflow vein under fluoroscopic guidance. A 4.5F 
micropuncture sheath
was advanced and used to exchange for an 0.035 Glidewire. The 
Glidewire was
advance to the level of the subclavian vein across the area of 
stenosis. A
short 6 ___ sheath was placed over the wire. An 8 mm x 4 cm 
Mustang balloon
was placed over the wire and targeted at the cephalic arch 
junction to the
subclavian vein. Balloon angioplasty was performed. With the 
balloon still up,
a contrast injection run was performed to evaluate the arterial 
anastomosis. 
The balloon was then deflated and post angioplasty images were 
obtained.
 Next, 1% lidocaine was injected in the subcutaneous tissues 
retrograde
(directed towards the arterial anastomosis) and access into the 
cephalic vein
was obtained using a 21G micropuncture needle under palpatory 
guidance. An
0.018 wire was advanced into the artery under fluoroscopic 
guidance. A 4.5F
micropuncture sheath was advanced and used to exchange for an 
0.035 Glidewire.
The Glidewire was advance into the artery and a short 6 ___ 
sheath was
placed over the wire. Multiple wires and catheters were used to 
navigate into
the proximal artery but ultimately achieved utilizing a Direxion 
Swan
microcatheter and Headliner steerable Guidewire. The Kumpe 
catheter was
advanced and the microcatheter and wire were exchanged for a 
___ wire. The
Kumpe catheter was removed and the 8 mm x 4 cm mustang balloon 
was targeted
over the stenosis at the juxta-anastomotic area. Following 
balloon
angioplasty, marked improvement of the stenosis was noted.
 The sheaths were removed and hemostasis was achieved using 
manual pressure and pursestring sutures.
There were no immediate complications.
 FINDINGS: 
 1. No evidence of thrombus within the left upper extremity 
fistula.
2. Severe stenosis (90%) of the venous outflow at the cephalic 
arch junction
to the subclavian vein as well as severe stenosis (90%)  at the 
juxta-
anastomotic area. Both lesions are recurrent as they were 
previously diagnosed
and treated during the last thrombectomy procedure in ___. Both cephalic arch and arterial anastomosis were balloon 
angioplastied
using an 8 mm balloon.
4. Marked improvement in flow at both sites following balloon 
angioplasty.
IMPRESSION: 
Satisfactory restoration of flow following balloon angioplasty 
of the venous
outflow at the cephalic arch junction to the subclavian vein as 
well as the
juxta-anastomotic area with excellent angiographic and clinical 
results with
restoration of a good palpable thrill.
 The study and the report were reviewed by the staff 
radiologist.

obstructive nephropathy from a neurogenic bladder.  Usually 
___.  AV Fistula clotted off and temporary femoral HD 
catheter placed in ED on ___.  Transplant surgery and 
nephrology recommended fistulogram with possible ___ 
thrombolysis.  On ___, ___ performed a successful 
fistulogram/balloon angioplasty and deemed the fistula ready for 
hemodialysis.  Hemodialysis was completed successfully on ___,

Associated underlying atelectasis is seen.  Blunting of the left 
lateral 
costophrenic angle could be due to overlying soft tissues 
although small 
underlying effusion is also possible. Superimposed pulmonary 
vascular 
congestion is suspected. Atherosclerotic calcifications noted at 
the aortic 
arch.   
IMPRESSION: 
Interval enlargement of the moderate to large right-sided 
pleural effusion. 
Pulmonary vascular congestion. 
 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ year old gentleman with history of ESRD on HD since ___, AF 
and HFrEF (LVEF ___ in ___ presents from ___ facility 
with hypotension and hyperkalemia. 

# Hyperkalemia: Mr. ___ presented with a serum potassium of 
7.1 on admission (___), with peaked T waves noted on ECG. 
This was likely due to known ESRD exacerbated by volume 
depletion and pre-renal azotemia in the setting of a recent 
diarrheal illness and decreased PO intake. Additionally, Mr. 
___ acknowledged increased consumption of foods high in 
potassium including avocado. In the ED, Mr. ___ received 2 
grams of Calcium Gluconate and 10 units of insulin, as well as 
urgent dialysis which brought his potassium down to 5.8 ECG 
changes improved with resolution of the peaked T waves. Mr. 
___ received hemodialysis two additional days during 
hospitalization on ___ and ___ to control his potassium levels. 
At the time of discharge his potassium level was 5.7. He 
remained asymptomatic during hospitalization and will continue 
with his normal dialysis schedule as an outpatient. 

# Afib with RVR: Mr. ___ has a history of atrial 
fibrillation with RVR. His CHADS2 score is 4. He has been on 
propanolol LA 80 mg PO QD at home to rate control his atrial 
fibrillation. He is also on propanolol 20 mg PO TID PRN for 
HR>110. During his hospitalization his heart rate was well 
controlled on the 80 mg propanolol long acting QD. He did 
experience two episodes of atrial fibrillation with RVR during 
hospitalization that lasted less than 1 minute. He remained 
asymptomatic during these episodes and they resolved without any 
medical intervention. Mr. ___ also remained on his Warfarin 
1 mg QD for anticoagulation. His INR remained therapeutic, 
ranging between 2.8 and 2.9.  
 
# Pleural Effusion: Mr. ___ has a history of transudative 
pleural effusions likely secondary to congestive heart failure. 
He recently required a right sided thoracentesis in ___ 
draining approximatley 1300 cc of transudative fluid. During 
this hospitalizaiton, he was noted to have a right sided pleural 
effusion based on physical examination findings and CXR. He was 
placed on O2 during hospitalization. He underwent three sessions 
of hemodialysis to improve his volume status. He was weaned off 
of O2 with stable oxygen saturations. No thoracentesis was 
performed during this hospitalization, as he was not  hypoxic on 
room air. 

# Acute on chronic systolic CHF (LVEF ___ in ___. Mr. 
___ has a history of systolic heart failure (LVEF ___ in 
___. He was noted to have moderate to large pulmonary 
effusion on the right. This was thought to be secondary to his 
chronic heart failure. He continued on his home reigmen of 
Furosemide 80 mg PO daily on non-dialysis days. He also had 
three sessions of hemodialysis to maintain fluid balance.  
 
# ESRD: Mr. ___ has a history of ESRD thought to be 
secondary to hypertension and obstructive nephropathy. He has 
been on dialysis since ___ and has a left upper extremity AVF. 
His baseline creatinine is between ___. He received hemodialysis 
on three occasions during hospitalization. He was also continued 
on nephrocaps,cinacalcet, and sevelamer. His creatinine at 
discharge was 7.3.  

# HTN: Mr. ___ blood pressure remained well controlled 
while in the hospital. He was continued with his home 
medications: propanolol LA 80 mg PO daily, as well as propanolol 
20 mg PO TIDPRN for heart rate >110. 

# Neurogenic bladder: Mr. ___ has a history of neurogenic 
bladder and a history of urosepsis. He straight caths at home. 
He also receives neomycin-polymyxin B GU 20 mL ___ Q48 hours with 
these straight caths as UTI prophylaxis. Also continued on his 
finasteride 5 mg PO daily. 

# Insomnia. Mr. ___ continued on his Zolpidem for insomnia. 
He was able to sleep during his hospitalization without any 
issues. 

# Gout. Mr. ___ has a history of gout. He was kept on his 
home dosage of allopurinol 50 mg PO every other day. 

# Hypothyroidism: Mr. ___ has a history of hypothyroidism. A 
TSH obtained was 6.3. He remained on his home dose of synthroid. 
 

# TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
Hypoxia: Patient was hypxoic during hospitalization. He was 
found to have a right sided pleural effusion based on physical 
examination findings as well as X-Ray. He has had a pleural 
effsion in the past (___) that drained 1300 cc transudative 
fluid via thoracentesis. ___ require thoracentesis in the 
future.

Hyperkalemia: The patient presented with hyperkalemia with 
potassium reaching 7.1. This was treated with calcium, 
insulin/dextrose, as well as three days of dialysis. Close 
monitoring of the potassium levels will be necessary as an 
outpatient and should be followed.  

Tachycardia: During hospitalization, Mr. ___ experienced two 
episodes of atrial fibrillation with RVR (up to 151). These 
episodes lasted less than 1 minute and resolved on their own. 
Additionally, he was asymptomatic during these times. He was 
maintained on his home dose of propanolol LA 80 mg daily.

History of Present Illness:
This ___ man on chronic hemodialysis for end-stage renal 
disease, hypertensive heart disease with systolic and diastolic 
left ventricular dysfunction and chronic atrial fibrillation on 
long-term warfarin anticoagulation is admitted in transfer for 
management of refractory hypotension.

He was in his usual metastable state until the night prior to 
admission when he had two loose bowel movements, vague flu-like 
symptoms and profuse sweating.  There was a somewhat 
questionable history of dark stools.  His attendant noted 
hypotension with systolic blood pressures in the ___ and a 
temperature of 94°, and notified his physician.  Oral volume 
repletion was not successful and the ambulance that was to bring 
him to hemodialysis was diverted to ___ 
for stabilization and transferred to ___.  He received 1L NS 
at ___ improvement in BP to 95-110. Also given pantoprazole 
IV. He was then transferred to ___ ED for further eval. 

Of note, pt has had several prior admissions for hypotension in 
setting of AFib with RVR. Per outpatient Cardiology notes, 
whenever he misses his home metoprolol this results in 
uncontrolled RVR and hypotension. His wife reports that she HELD 
his home metoprolol this morning beause of hypotension. Also of 
note, he had recent admission from ___ for non-heeling 
L heel ulcer. Debridement and bone fragment culture/path showed 
evidence of chronic osteomyelitis. Wound culture showed 1+ PMNs, 
culture negative. He was treated with empiric IV 
vanco/ceftazidime x6 week course which was completed in 
___. Wife states there has been more weeping from the 
ulcer in the past few days. 

In the ED, initial vitals:  98 139 70/50 16 100% 2L. BP 
spontaneously improved to 127/62 without intervention. EKG 
showed AFib with wide QRS complexes (unchanged from baseline

and crossmatched for 2 units blood. Admitted to ICU for urgent 
HD and treatment of hypotension. On transfer, vitals were:  97.1 
137 ___ 100% Nasal Cannula.  

On arrival to the MICU, vitals are: HR 140s, SBP ___, unable to 
obtain temperature (hypothermic). EKG showed AFlutter with wide 
QRS (baseline) and peaked T waves. Received metoprolol 5mg IV 
with no effect and 1L IVF with little improvement effect. 
Started on peripheral neosynephrine. He was mentating well

color Doppler. The estimated right atrial pressure is ___ mmHg. 
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left 
ventricular cavity size is top normal/borderline dilated. 
Overall left ventricular systolic function is moderately 
depressed (LVEF= ___ %). The right ventricular cavity is 
mildly dilated with depressed free wall contractility. There is 
abnormal septal motion/position consistent with right 
ventricular pressure/volume overload. The ascending aorta is

LEFT FOOT X-RAY (___): 
LEFT FOOT RADIOGRAPH
 
CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___ male with chronic 
osteomyelitis status post antibiotic treatment with heel ulcer.
 
TECHNIQUE:  AP, lateral, and oblique radiographs of the left 
foot were obtained.
 
COMPARISON:  Foot radiography dated ___.
 
FINDINGS:
 
There is ulceration along the posterior heel.  No definite 
cortical irregularity is seen along the posterior aspect of the 
calcaneus to suggest definite osteomyelitis.  There is diffuse 
osteopenia and vascular calcifications present.  Redemonstration 
of ununited fracture of the first proximal phalanx is seen with 
associated fusion of the first interphalangeal joint.  The 
talocalcaneal joint also appears fused.  Severe advanced 
degenerative changes present throughout most of the hindfoot and 
mid foot.  Severe degenerative changes are also present at the 
first MTP joint.
 
IMPRESSION:  Severe osteopenia and degenerative changes as 
detailed above without definite evidence of osteomyelitis.  If 
there is continued clinical concern for osteomyelitis, MRI 
examination may be performed.
 
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ is an ___ M with h/o ESRD on HD, AFib on 
Coumadin, HTN and h/o autonomic neuropathy who presented with 
hypotension and dark stools, found to be in AFlutter/AFib with 
RVR and rates in 140s. 

# SHOCK: Tachycardic to 140s-150s on arrival and hypotensive to 
SBP ___ which improved minimally with 2L IVF and metoprolol 
5mg IV x4, required pressors. Heart rate improved to ___ 
with IV dilt but remained hypotensive. Most likely 
multifactorial etiology: volume depletion (in setting of recent 
diarrhea) and high heart rate leading to poor forward flow in 
setting of systolic CHF and also probable high-output heart 
failure given presence of HD fistula. TTE on admission showed EF 
___. Also considered other etiologies like hypovolemic shock 
from GI blood loss given dark stools, but HCT remained stable 
(hemoconcentrated on admission, then returned to baseline low 
___ and no melanotic stools during admission. Also considered 
septic shock, but there were no infectious sources found on 
cultures. Initially treated with broad spectrum antibiotics 
(vanc/cefepime) but these were stopped on HD #2. Because of his 
severe hypotension on admission, CRRT line was placed and he 
received CRRT until BPs stable on HD#2. A-line also placed for 
ABGs. Received a total of 2L IVF in ICU, and 1L IVF prior to 
admission. He was transferred to the floor where he remained 
normotensive and afebrile.  

# TACHYCARDIA: Pt has history of AFib and frequent episodes of 
RVR in the past. On arrival to the ICU he was in AFlutter with 
rates 140s-150s which was worsening his hypotension. Had not 
received his home dose of metoprolol succinate that day. 
Received metoprolol 5mg IV x4 with little effect on heart rate. 
Diltiazem 10mg IV x1 was then given with significant HR 
improvement (to ___ but persistent hypotension. He was 
restarted on his home metoprolol the morning of HD #2 with good 
rate control in the low 100's.  He was monitored on telemetry 
and had no further episodes of Afib with RVR.   

# CHF: Pt with systolic CHF, EF 30% on TTE during this 
hospitalization. No significant pulmonary edema on admission 
CXR. His home Lasix 80mg 4 times/week was held in ICU due to 
hypotension. He is on metoprolol, no other CHF meds. This was 
discussed with his PCP ___ and family were 
educated on importance of not missing any doses of patient's 
home Metoprolol.  

# LEFT HEEL ULCER: Has chronic L heel osteomyelitis s/p 6 week 
antibiotic course which was completed in ___. 
Given concern for sepsis he had repeat foot x-ray which showed 
no osteomyelitis. Was seen by podiatry who felt the ulcer was 
superficial and non-purulent, recommended wound care with 
HydroGel (dressing changes daily) and making sure his waffle 
boot remained inflated at all times. The heel was debrided in 
the MICU.  He should follow up with his home podiatrist as an 
outpatient.  On day of discharge wound cultures grew coag + 
staph aureus (rare) and corynebacterium diphetheroids.  This was 
discussed with the podiatry who felt that this was likely skin 
contaminant.  There was no indication for further wound 
debridement and given patient's recent aggressive IV antibiotic 
course, both podiatry and primary team felt that oral 
antibiotics were not indicated at this time.  Patient will 
continue to have wound care at home using Hydrogel and will 
follow up with podiatrist. 

# DARK STOOLS: Guaiac positive in ED but no frank melena there 
or in ICU thus far. Considered GI bleed but H/H remained stable. 
Low suspicion for GI bleed at this time. He was initially on 
Pantoprazole 40mg IV BID, then switched back to home PO 
pantoprazole on HD #2.  No further evidence of GI bleed this 
admission and H/H remained stable.  Patient was discharged on 
home Pantoprazole regimen.  

# AFIB: CHADS2 of 3. Anticoagulated with Coumadin. Reversed INR 
with 1 unit of FFP in order to place CRRT line. Home Coumadin 
restarted on ___. Coumadin dose on discharge is 1mg but 
patient was to have INR checked at HD on day after discharge for 
further instructions on Coumadin dosing. 

Transitional Issues:
# Patient will need continued Physical Therapy at home
# Please follow aspiration precautions if re-admitted and 
discharge diet: Pureed (dysphagia), nectar pre-thickened 
liquids, patient to have formal video swallow eval with Speech 
and Swallow on ___

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,
 
It was a pleasure treating you during this admission. You were 
admitted to the ___ ICU with 
low blood pressure. This was thought to be related to 
uncontrolled heart rates and volume loss from diarrhea. You were 
treated initially with antibiotics for presumed infection but 
this was continued after cultures returned negative. Metoprolol 
and Diltiazem were used to control your heart rate with 
resulting improved blood pressures at better controlled heart 
rates. Prior to discharge dialysis was completed without 
complication to take off some extra fluid.  You will still be 
scheduled for revision of your AV Fistula on ___ with Dr. 
___ at 1pm.  Please take your Metoprolol every day as 
prescribed, it is very important to keep your heart rate under 
control so that you do not develop very low blood pressure 
again.  Please also go to your dialysis center in ___ 
TOMORROW ___, because you need close follow up of your INR 
(for your warfarin). They will check it tomorrow and let you 
know what dose of warfarin to use. Since your family expressed 
concern regarding your need for oxygen at home, please call Dr. 
___ office on ___ morning to schedule a follow-up 
appointment to discuss this.

We wish you the best.
   
Weigh yourself every morning, call MD if weight goes up more 
than 3 lbs.

You were evaluated by the speech team, who made the

who was admitted from dialysis for Afib with RVR and 
hypotension.  
 
ACTIVE ISSUES:

# Atrial Fibrillation with RVR: Mr. ___ was admitted with 
hypotension and tachycardia, which per his PCP/cardiologist and 
prior records is not unusual for the patient and likely due to 
mild hypovolemia prior to HD without receiving an initial fluid 
bolus. Patient was asymptomatic. He received metoprolol 5mg IV 
and 50mg PO, and HR controlled down from 120s to ___.  He was 
continued with metoprolol 50mg QID, and transitioned to his home 
dose of metoprolol succinate 100mg BID. He remained in atrial 
fibrillation, with rate controlled in the ___ during his 
admission.  He successfully underwent hemodialysis on ___, with 
1L of fluid off. Patient is very sensitive to fluid shifts 
during dialysis. We advised ___ that he 
should receive IVF prior to HD if BP is low on arrival. If SBP < 
110, give 500mL of fluid prior to HD. If SBP < 100, give 1000mL 
of fluid prior to HD. INR was 4.2 so coumadin held on ___. 
Discussed with his dialysis center to recheck INR in HD ___, 
and redose coumadin as necessary.

# Hypotension: Likely due to hypovolemia related to HD, causing 
tachycardia with poor filling times, thereby worsening 
hypotension. Blood pressure improved with heart rate control. 

CHRONIC ISSUES:

# Anemia: Chronic, likely related to ESRD. Previous iron studies 
c/w anemia of chronic disease, recent vit b12/folate normal.  

# ESRD: Did not complete HD session as outpatient ___ given 
Afib with RVR. Successfully underwent HD on ___ as inpatient. 
Continued nephrocaps, sevelamer, Cinacalcet.
 
# Hypothyroidism: Continued on home Levothyroxine  

# Gout:  Continued on home allopurinol.

# Left heel wound: Patient with left heel wound, did not appear 
infected, no purulent drainage.  
 
# Aspiration precaution and diet per last speech/swallow 
recommendations. However, patient and wife were upset with these 
diet restrictions, and insisted on a regular diet, understanding 
the need for low potassium and low sodium diet.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
- Check INR in HD ___, coumadin dosing per dialysis center. 
- Patient is very sensitive to fluid shifts during dialysis. 
Advised ___ Dialysis Center that he should receive IVF 
prior to HD if BP is low on arrival. If SBP < 110, give 500mL of 
fluid prior to HD. If SBP < 100, give 1000mL of fluid prior to 
HD.
- Resume prior HD schedule: ___, Th, Sa

IMAGING
=======
___: CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
FINDINGS: 
AP portable semi upright view of the chest. Lung volumes are 
markedly low
which limits assessment. There is subtle increase in left basal 
opacity which could represent pneumonia. Mild bibasilar 
atelectasis also likely present. No overt edema. No large 
effusion or pneumothorax. Heart size remains prominent. 
Mediastinal contour is unchanged. A vascular stent projects over 
the left axilla. Bony structures are intact.
 
IMPRESSION: 
Bibasilar opacities likely represent atelectasis. Increasing 
left lower lobe opacity, may represent a developing pneumonia.

___: CT ABDOMEN AND PELVIS WITH CONTRAST
IMPRESSION: 
1. Sequela of probable chronic aspiration is noted in the lung 
bases,
bilaterally.
2. The bladder wall is chronically thickened and the mucosa 
appears shaggy,
which may represent chronic urinary tract infection. Air is 
noted within the bladder and correlation with prior 
instrumentation is recommended.
3. Multiple, bilateral renal cysts. One cyst at the inferior 
pole of the right kidney is hyperdense and a nonemergent MRI 
should be considered for further evaluation.

___: MRI FOOT WITHOUT CONTRAST (LEFT)
IMPRESSION:
1. Soft tissue changes at the heel with underlying marrow signal 
changes at
the posterior calcaneus consistent with osteomyelitis.
2. No soft tissue fluid collection seen.
3. Edema and linear low signal in third metatarsal suggestive of 
fracture.
This could be confirmed on radiograph.
4. Moderate midfoot degenerative change.

___: MRI FOOT WITHOUT CONTRAST (RIGHT)
IMPRESSION:
1. Skin ulcer over the lateral heel with subjacent soft tissue 
changes and
mild reactive marrow edema at the posterior lateral aspect of 
the calcaneus. In the absence of correlative low T1 signal this 
is more likely to be reactive marrow edema than osteomyelitis.
2. No fluid collection is seen.
3. Moderate midfoot arthritis as detailed above.
 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ male with complex medical history including A. fib 
on Coumadin, end-stage renal disease (multifactiral secondary to 
hypertension and obstructive nephropathy) on HD 
___ since ___, hypertension, CHF, Gout, 
PVD, cricopharyngeal dysphagia ___ neck fracture, history of 
autonomic dysfunction, persistent volume-sensitive BP 
regulation, presents with generalized weakness and fevers found 
to have CXR with left lower lobe pneumonia concerning for HCAP 
given his recent hospitalization and that he is on dialysis. 
During hospitalization, also noted to have osteomyelitis of the 
left calcaneus. 
 
#Healthcare Associated Pneumonia: Mr. ___ presented with 
fever, hypotension, cough, fatigue, leukocytosis (12.3), with 
CXR notable for a left lower lobe infiltrate. Given risk factors 
include HD as well as recent hospitalization (discharged 
___ as well as fact that he is on hemodialysis, he was 
treated with vancomycin and ceftazidime for healthcare 
associated pneumonia. Blood cultures on admission were negative. 
With treatment with vancomycin and ceftazidime, Mr. ___ 
energy improved, cough dissipated, and leukocytosis resolved. 
His oxygen was downtitrated to 1L of oxygen with plan for him to 
continue CPAP at home. He will continue vancomycin and 
ceftazidime for osteomyelitis (as noted below), thus covering a 
total HCAP regimen length.

# Left Calcaneual Osteomyelitis: Mr ___ has a history of 
chronic wounds on right and left calcaneus. He has been seen by 
wound care by Dr. ___ at ___. While 
hospitalized, he underwent an MRI of the feet which indicated 
"soft tissue changes at the heel with underlying marrow signal 
changes at the posterior calcaneus consistent with 
osteomeylitis." Given these findings, both Podiatry and 
Infectious Disease was consulted. Podiatry evaluated Mr. ___ 
and after discussion with him and given his multiple 
co-morbidities it was determined he did not want any aggressive 
intervention. Recommendation from Podiatry included "mulipodus 
splints for offloading bilateral heels. 
Santyl/Adaptic/4x4/Kerlix for bilateral heel wounds. No plan for 
biopsy or debridement was recommended given Mr. ___ desire 
to not want aggressive intervention. Infectious Disease also 
evaluated Mr. ___. Based on previous wound cultures from 
Podiatry (MRSA, Enterococcus, Proteus), and numerous 
co-morbidities, recommendation is to continue vancomycin and 
ceftazidime (both of which can be dosed during dialysis to 
complete a 6 week course for osteomyelitis (___). 
Per recommendations from ID, vancomycin will be dosed with 
dialysis, whereas ceftazidime will be dosed 2 grams after 
dialysis on ___, 2 grams after dialysis on ___, 3 
grams after dialysis on ___. During hospitalization, ESR 
was >130 and CRP was 68.7. Per recommendation from Infectious 
Disease, Mr. ___ require weekly ___ labs 
including CBC with diff, BUN/Cr, vancomycin trough, ESR, CRP. 
These will be drawn at dialysis sessions on ___ with 
results followed by Dr. ___. 

Mr. ___ has a ___ appointment with Dr. ___ 
with ___ Care at ___ on ___. 

#Left Mid to Distal Third Metatarsal Fracture: Noted on MRI of 
the left foot. After discussion with Dr. ___ further 
intervention given Mr. ___ baseline limited motility. He 
was seen by Physical Therapy with following recommendations: 
Continue to recommend daily OOB activity via Hoyer lift to/from
chair. Recommend waffle boots for bil ulcers. Recommend OOB to 
chair for no more than 1 hour given risk for skin breakdown and 
patient's inability to independently weight.
Continued wound care f/u. Patient is high Delirium risk; please 
follow delirium prevention protocol. Recommend non-weight 
bearing on left lower extremity and pivot in multi-podus splint 
on right. 

# Tropenemia: Initial EKG showed Afib with RVR and lateral ST 
depressions with troponin elevation to 0.23 (baseline 0.08) 
likely in the setting of HCAP/sepsis/ESRD. CM-MB flat. Repeat 
troponin 0.25 with CK-MB 1. Likely related to ESRD.    

# Atrial Fibrillation: In the past, Mr. ___ has had multiple 
admissions for atrial fibrillation with RVR associated with 
hypotension. CHADS-2 4. He was anti-coagulated with warfarin 
during hospitalization with warfarin 2 mg PO every other day, 
and warfarin 3 mg PO every other day. He was rate controlled 
with propanolol LA 120 mg PO daily. INR at the time of discharge

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ is a ___ year old male with history of ESRD on HD, 
CHF, atrial fibrillation, and peripheral vascular disease who 
presented to the ED with clotted AV fistula. 

# Bradycardia with subsequent cardiac arrest: 
The patient underwent thrombectomy on morning of ___. At 
the end of the procedure, the patient developed nausea and 
progressive bradycardia. He initially had a junctional rhythm 
and hypotension. The patient was given atropine, dopamine, and 
norepinephrine drip with transient response. Transcutaneous 
pacing was initiated with stabilization of heart rate in 70 and 
systolic blood pressure in ___. The patient was intubated and 
transferred to the MICU. 

Shortly after arrival, the patient developed progressive 
hypotension and cardiac arrest. He was found to be in PEA. The 
patient received multiple rounds of CPR, epinephrine, 
norepinephrine, calcium, sodium bicarbonate, insulin, and 
amiodarone. A left intraosseous, femoral central venous, and 
femoral arterial line were placed. Bedside echo during arrest 
demosntrated LVEF 40-50% without clear effusion. 

The patient developed ventricular tachycardia and was shocked 
with return to atrial fibrillation with aberrancy with return of 
spontaneous circulation. By the end of the 45 minute code, the 
patient was on maximal doses of 4 vasopressor agents with 
persistent hypotension. Patient's wife was notified of events 
along with patient's PCP ___ Dr. ___ were 
at the bedside. At that time, patient had persistent acidosis on 
four vasopressors. There was no evidence of hyperkalemia and 
chest x-ray was confirmed endotracheal placement and absence of 
pneumothorax.

Patient's wife arrived at bedside shortly after arrest in the 
ICU. Given his likely poor neurologic outcome, persistent shock, 
and ongoing bleeding from endotracheal tube, the decision was 
made along with the patient's wife and PCP to not escalate care 
and that CPR would be medically futile. It was felt his overall 
presentation to be persistent cardiovascular collapse after a 
profound vagal response. 

The patient died on ___ at 14:08. The patient's wife and 
primary care physician were at the bedside.

Brief Hospital Course:
___ with PMH ESRD on HD (___), afib on warfarin presenting 
at the prompting of his PCP for evaluation of anemia and guaiac 
positive brown stool. 
.
# Anemia: ___ records show no real change in baseline anemia 
on admission however his anemia has been slowly worsening over 
time which has been attributed mostly to ESRD. More concerning 
was newly guaiac positive stool; on previous admission he was 
noted to have both esophagitis and gastritis on EGD and repeat 
EGD had been due to subjective clinical improvement. Repeat EGD 
showed persistent gastritis and patient was continued on 
pantoprazole BID. He was also started on sucralfate TID. Capsule 
study was done on day of discharge and he will follow up with 
PCP and GI for the results. He did not require any transfusions 
during this admission and remained hemodynamically stable 
without orthostasis or active signs of bleeding throughout. 
.
.
# ESRD on HD: Continued on home schedule ___. He was 
followed by the nephrology team while in the hospital who 
recommended follow up with vascular surgery for possible 
revision of his AVF as it was not functioning optimally. 
Outpatient follow up was arranged with vascular surgery. Home 
renal medications continued: Cinacalcet 30 mg PO BID, sevelamer 
CARBONATE 1600 mg PO TID W/MEALS, Paricalcitol 6 mcg IV 3X/WEEK 
(___) with dialysis treatment, Nephrocaps 1 CAP PO DAILY.  
Recommend consideration of trial increased EPO dose with 
dialysis and then ___ to see if this improves anemia.  
.
.
# HTN: Stable and inactive during this hospitalization. 
Continued home metoprolol. 
.
# ___ Dilated CM  -  EF ___ on last ECHO. No issues 
during this hospitalization. Continued home metoprolol and home 
lasix.
.
# Gout: Stable and inactive during this hospitalization. 
Continued home allopurinol.
.
# Hypothyroidism: Stable and inactive during this 
hospitalization. Continue home levothyroxine. 
.
# BPH: Stable, continued Finasteride 5 mg PO DAILY, continued 
Lidocaine Jelly 2% (Urojet) 1 Appl TP PRN straight cath per home 
schedule. 
. 
.
Transitional Issues: 
- f/u with PCP
- INR monitoring at dialysis with dose adjustment of warfarin as 
needed
- continue dialysis on home schedule, follow with nephrology
- would recommend trial of increased epo x 1 month and reeval to 
see if any improvement in anemia
- sucralfate started in addition to continuation of pantoprazole 
for gastritis seen on EGD
- vascular surgery follow up on ___ for possible revision of AVF

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ was admitted for a scheduled repair of a left upper 
extremity AVF aneurysm. During the procedure he had an episode 
of afib with RVR, with resultant hypotension. He briefly 
required neo postop for blood pressure support in PACU. He 
quickly weaned off however was kept in house overnight given 
continued issues with afib rate control. Of note he has had many 
prior episodes of this. Overnight he remained in afib with 
intermittent rate control, with systolic BP 90-100. His midnight 
potassium was 6.4 and he was given insulin/glucose/calcium, a 
repeat was 4.2. He was taken for dialysis early in the morning 
of POD1, and at HD his rate slowed to 70's-80's with resultant 
improvement in his blood pressure. He stayed rate controlled 
throughout HD. His outpatient cardiologist Dr. ___ 
with him and given that this has been a continued problem for 
him decided to increase his home metoprolol from 150'' to 200''. 
He was given coumadin, his heel wound dressings were changed, 
and he was straight cathed x1 (which he normally does daily at 
home). He was discharged home on POD 1 after confirming his 
outpatient plan with the patient, wife, outpatient cardiologist, 
and visiting nurse who expressed understanding and agreement.

presenting to PCP with fatigue and admitted for inpatient 
colonoscopy prep for evaluation of anemia, developed with lower 
GI bleed at polypectomy site in the setting of re-starting 
anticoagulation
.
# Normocytic Anemia: The patient presented to his Primary Care 
Physian with an 8 pt drop in Hct and guaiac-positive brown 
stools. He was referred to the ED for an expedited work-up for 
GI blood loss. His Fe studies revealed a serum Fe low-normal at 
41, non-elevated TIBC, and elevated Ferritin most consistent 
with chronic inflammation, but not ruling out a component of 
iron deficiency. Other causes of anemia to be considered include 
EPO-resistance and loss of blood during HD. His Coumadin was 
held and he was placed on a Heparin gtt for bridging, given his 
CHADS2 score of 4. He underwent an EGD and Colonoscopy that 
found mild gastritis, an antral lesion (biopsied) and two 
colonic polyps that were removed, but nothing to explain acute 
anemia. Biopsy report showed adenomas. He was continued on a PPI 
and 24 hours after the polypectomy his Coumadin and Heparin gtt 
bridge were re-initiated. He subsequently developed maroon 
stools indicating a lower GI bleed (addressed below). The 
patient should follow up with a Gastroenterologist in the 
future.    
.
# Post-Polypectomy Lower GI Bleed: The patient developed maroon 
stools three days after his colonoscopy with polyp removal. His 
anticoagulation (Heparin and Coumadin) was immediately 
discontinued. He was trasnfused 1U PRBC for a 2 pt drop in Hct. 
GI took the patient for a flexible sigmoidoscopy that revealed 
the likely site of bleeding - the distal polypectomy site, which 
now had a blood clot adhered to the lesion. We closely monitored 
his Hct, which increased appropriately with the blood 
transfusions and remained stable at ___. The patient remained 
asymptomatic and hemodynamically stable. It was decided to hold 
all anticoagulation for at least 10 days and restart on 
___. The decision to re-start anticoagulation should be 
also guided by his Cardiologist and Primary Care Physician. A 
repeat CBC to ensure stability should be obtained in 3 days 
after discharge, or earlier should he develop bloody or dark 
stools or symptoms suggesting acute anemia - dizziness, 
light-headedness, chest pain, dyspnea.
.  
# Fatigue: This was the patient's presenting complaint to his 
Primary Care Physician. There are a number of potential 
etiologies (including anemia) that can  be addressed in the 
outpatient setting. We found no evidence of underlying infection 
- no fevers, leukocytosis, and blood/urine cultures were 
negative. His cardiac rhythm is atrial fibrillation with widely 
varying rates from tachycardia to bradycardia; however, he 
reports not being aware of the rhythm. Thyroid studies revealed 
a mildly elevated TSH (7.5), but normal free T4. He denied any 
symptoms of depression, which could be presenting as fatigue. 
Further work-up, including age-appropriate cancer screening

Brief Hospital Course:
___ y/o p with PMH of ESRD, recurrent supraventricular 
tachycardia, diastolic and systolic heart failure( ___, 
ECHO ___, type II DM, hypertension, anemia of chronic 
disease, sleep apnea, autonomic disfunction, hypothyroidism was 
transferred from dialysis for hypotension in setting of 
asymptomatic supraventricular tachycardia (atrial flutter with 
2:1 block.

#Chronic supraventricular tachycardia, primarily AF on warfarin: 
Transferred from dialysis unit due to hypotension in setting of 
a fib with RVR.  He was given dilt in the ER and initially 
hypotensive SBPs ___. Of note, he was previously consulted with 
SVT both in ___ and inpatient 
___ then clasiffied as persistent AF, treated 
with BB and fluids for hypotension at that time. Diltiazem 
previously induced hypotension, he was swiched from metoprolol 
to propranolol ER qD 60mg because of its  liver metabolism 
(patient with ESRD on HD).  In the ER, EKG showed atrial flutter 
with 2:1 block and ventricular rate 148. He was given dilt in 
the ER and initially hypotensive SBPs ___.
 
Because of multiple comorbidities and the fact that the patient 
is asymptomatic did not perform EP examination of LA, which 
requires full anesthesia.  Patient was started on metoprolol 50 
QID due to afib w/ RVR.  Patient continued to be tachycardic - 
aflutter vs afib with RVR while at inpatient dialysis unit.  
Received 5mg IV metoprolol, became hypotensive to ___, given 
250NS bolus w/ improvement in pressures.  Rate control also 
improved.  Patient was switched from metoprol back to 
propranolol per outpatient cardiologist, dose of propranolol was 
increased from 60 to 80 mg daily.  Was monitored on Tele. 
CHADS2=3 and is on coumadin at home.  However patient was found 
to have supra therapeutic INR, thus coumadin was initially held. 
 He was restarted on his home dose on ___ (home dose: 3 
mg MoWeFri alternating with 2mg ___.  His INRs are managed 
by the nephrologist at his outpatient dialysis unit (___ 
___).  Patient's rates and pressures improved with above 
interventions and was discharged back to home.  
 
# sCHF:  Systolic CHF reveled on outpatient TTE ___ with 
LVEF ___.  At ___ patient presented with CHF 
decompensation described as cryptogenic in a setting of "viral 
infection". Patients HF might be multifactoral including ESRD, 
rSVT, HTN. He has moderate to to right pleural effusion. 
Effusion was described as chronic in note from ___. 
Patient was on lasix 80mg prior to admition. He denies dyspnea 
and chest pain but his physical activity is limited(most of the 
time he sits in chair on lie in bed.) so exrtional dyspnea can 
not be excluded. He denies orthopnea.  Patient was continued on 
his home lasix dose.

#Hyperkalemia: likely related to ESRD.  Improved after HD 
sessions on ___ and ___.

#WBC in urine:  Patient chronically colonized, receives 
intermittent bladder irrigation with neomycin-polymyxin as 
outpatient.  Received 1x dose of ceftriaxone in ED.  Antibiotics 
not continued as urine culture negative. 

# Hypothyroidism: Patient reports that he has hypothyroidism for 
___ years. He has extensive diaphoresis, feels weak and fatigue. 
He denies hand tremor, heat intolerance, muscle weakness. He was 
lethargic what could be reffered also to other 
conditions(hypotension, hyperkaliemia). His TSH was 7.2.  Did 
not increase home dose of levothyroxine in setting of admission 
for tachyarrythmia.  Would recommend increasing dose as 
outpatient. 

# Gout: Continued on home allopurinol. 

#ESRD on HD: access LUE fistula.  Went to HD on ___ and ___.  
Will continue as outpatient at ___.  Next session on 
___.  Continued on home dose of lasix.

#Hypertension
Patient has hypertension since ___ years. He had multiple 
epsiodes of hypotension in the past. We will continue his home 
medication with increased dose of propranolol. 

#Anemia of chronic disease
Patient has RBC=2,8; Hgb 9,5; MCV 107; MCH 34 consistent with 
megaloblastic anemia. His folate at ___ was 18,2; his vit 
B ___ was 1450 so he does not need require suplementaion. 
 Receives EPO 4000 Units SQ q ___ 

#MIDDM: not on any diabetes medications.  Fingersticks were 
monitored.

#Hyperparathyroidism
Patient has Ca 9.4 and eleveted P to 7.7, which in setting of 
ESRD are consistent with type II parathyroidism.  Was kept on 
low phospate diet, continued on cinacalcet.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
#Chronic supraventricular tachycardia on warfarin- patient 
presented with tachyarrhythmia and hypotension.  Treated with 
beta-blockers and IVF.  Patient's rates improved with above 
interventions.  His home propranolol dose was increased to 80mg 
per day (from 60mg).  Would recommend continuing at this dose 
and titrating pending rate control.

#Chronic UT colonization
Mr ___ urine cultures are negative and looks similar to 
priors, in particular from this past ___ when his urine culture 
was negative, which suggests chronic inflammation without 
bacterial colonization. No antibiotic treatment is necessary 
beyond current management with Neosporin irrigation and 20 ml 
post-cath dwell.

# Hypothyroidism:  His TSH was 7.2.  Would recommend increasing 
dose in outpatient setting.  Was not done while inpatient in 
setting of acute tachyarrythmia with associated hypotension.

# Anticoagulation: patient's INR was supra therapeutic on 
admission.  Warfarin restarted once INR came down to 1.9.  
Anticoagulation is managed by his nephrologist at outpatient 
dialysis.

that patient's tachycardia was worsened by dialysis ___ leading 
to hypotension. Tachycardia ultimately improved with propranolol 
20mg ___ in ED accompanied by home propranolol in AM of ___. 
Patient without signs or symptoms of infection causing 
tachycardia and hypotension at dialysis. Given ongoing 
difficulty with controlling patient's tachyarrhythmia, patient 
provided with prn propranolol ___ 20mg to take when developing 
tachycardia to prevent unstable tachycardia. Patient to 
follow-up with Dr. ___ as previously scheduled to continue to 
discuss next steps related to tachyarrhythmia. At this time, 
given patient's multiple comorbidities, patient was not felt to 
be good candidate for EP. 
 
# Hyperkalemia: Mild elevation to 5.5 on admission likely 
related to incomplete dialysis session without EKG changes. 
Improved to 5 prior to dialysis. 
 
# ESRD on HD: Patient on ___ schedule but only received 
partial session on day of admission and was thus dialyzed on 
___ with good effect and no further episodes of tachycardia or 
hypotension. Patient will complete regular dialysis session on 
___ as scheduled. 
  
# Systolic HF: Known systolic CHF at baseline with trace edema 
and ongoing chronic right pleural effusion seen on CXR with 
normal O2 sat throughout the day ___ though requiring oxygen 
overnight on admission. Patient's wife would like evaluation for 
home O2 for patient which Dr. ___ is actively working on at 
this time. Continued on home lasix while inpatient.

IMPRESSION:
Large right-sided pleural effusion with adjacent atelectasis.  
Left basilar
opacity likely represents atelectasis, although infection is not 
excluded. 
Mild increase in vascular congestion.
 
L Hip Xray ___
IMPRESSION:  Osteopenia without visualized fracture.

Chest XRay ___
FINDINGS:  Following right thoracentesis, a right pleural 
effusion has
substantially decreased in size with residual moderate pleural 
effusion
remaining, and no visible pneumothorax.  Associated improved 
aeration of the right lung with residual partial right middle 
and lower lobe atelectasis. 
Additionally, pulmonary vascular congestion has improved, and a 
small left
pleural effusion has decreased in size.
 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ y/o man with PMHx ESRD on HD, Atrial Fibrillation on 
coumadin, sCHF (LVEF 35%) and PVD presenting with obtundation 
occurring after initiation of home oxygen and concerning for 
hypoventilation and hypercarbia.

# Shortness of breath: Patient has been noted in OMR notes to 
have recently increased oxygen requirement. There are multiple 
etiologies. He has both systolic heart failure and renal 
failuire which caused volume overload and lead to his pleural 
effusions.  Patient unlikely to have superimposed pneumonia 
given his lack of systemic symptoms. But he is at risk for 
aspiration. He has been evaluated by speech and swallow with 
video swallow from ___ recommending have ground solids. 
There were no noted aspiration events by the patient. His first 
night he did become hypoxic, hypercarbic and lethargic and so he 
was started on BIPAP with improvement in his blood gas and 
importantly his mental status returned to baseline. He underwent 
thoracentesis which drained 1300cc transudative fluid consistent 
with known heart and kidney failure. He was continued on BiPAP 
but intermittently refused it likely because his respiratory 
status had greatly improved. He was discharged with home O2, 
physical therapy, and plan for close follow up with Dr. ___. 
He also received a new script for a NIPPV device.

# ESRD (multifactorial ___ HTN and obstructive nephropathy). He 
has been on dialysis since ___. He has a LUE AVF that was noted 
to have minor ulcers. Transplant surgery evaluated his ulcer and 
determine that they needed to be bandage and that the fistula 
could be accessed around the ulcers. He had no interruptions in 
his dialysis and no further intervention was needed. 

# Afib, on Coumadin - Patient has been anticoagulated for afib 
with CHAADS2 score of four. Per outpatient OMR notes, he is 
difficult to rate control, but has achieved good rate control 
with propanolol instead of metoprolol. Discussion with Dr. ___ 
___ him being on propanolol every six hours in the 
hospital. He was continued on this dose and monitored on tele 
and had good rate control in the hospital.

# Systolic CHF - He had known impaired systolic function with EF 
~40% from previous echo, and he had pitting edema, this was 
likely the etiology of his pleural effusions. The patient had 
shown signs of decompensation at home with new oxygen 
requirements. Patient has continued on his home lasix dose. Dry 
weight is according to patient 230lbs. He underwent dialysis in 
house and was continued on his lasix on nondialysis days.

# HTN - Patient was normotensive to slightly low blood 
pressures, but he remained asymptomatic and he was continue on 
his betablocker and lasix.
# Gout - He was continued on his home allopurinol
# Hypothyrodism - Patient appeare euthyroid and was continued on 
home synthroid

Mr. ___,

It was our pleasure caring for you at ___ 
___. You were admitted for shortness of breath. The 
fluid around your lung, which is not new, was slightly larger 
than previously. You had some difficulty breathing so you were 
started on a breathing machine at night, with good results in 
your breathing but had difficutly tolerating this over time and 
so will try another type of machine at home. You had your 
pleural effusion drained and your breathing improved. 

You were recommended to go to rehab by physical therapy but you 
declined and arrangements were made to make your home care 
safer.

and afib with RVR. Per report, he had a fever and purulent urine 
at rehab and received 2L NSS yesterday. He was transferred from 
___ ED because all of his care is at ___. At ___, his ECG 
showed a fib with HR 160s. His labs were significant for BNP 
>31000, WBC 10.8, and lactate 2.0. He reportedly received PO 
dilt 30mg, 30mg IV dilt, imipenem, and some fluids at ___ prior 
to transfer. 

In the ___ ED, his VS were T 96.6 HR 100 BP 105/82 RR 20 O2 
sat 100% 2L NC. The patient reported cough x5d and pus in 
straight cath today (chronic straight cath for neurogenic 
bladder). All other ROS neg. Has been at ___ after 
discharge from ___ (admission x10d for ESBL UTI per 
report). His primary cardiologist told the ED that dialysis 
paramaters and cardiac meds have been adjusted while at rehab 
with difficulty controlling volume status surrounding HD. He 
felt patient was being pulled of HD because of hypotension 
leading to a decrease of UOP and the rehab center no longer 
straight cathing for urine. His beta blockers were also 
reportedly stopped because of hypotension.  

The ED noted bibasilar crackles, dry MM, and cool extremities on 
exam. He was straight cathed with 30cc yellow pus returned. He 
was treated empirically with vancomycin. His course included a 
CXR showing hypoinflated lungs with no consolidation but 
bilateral pleural effusions. While in the ED, he became more 
hypotension to 85/55 with HR 133. He was somnolent but 
arousable. He was given PO metop 25mg and a total of 400cc IVFs 
here. His HRs remained in the 110-120s (occasionally 140s-150s) 
with SBPs 110 but was asymptomatic and mentating appropriately. 
His labs were significant for lactate of 1.7, WBC 12.1, Cr 8.5, 
BUN 65, and U/A with many bacteria, >182 WBCs, lg leuks, lg bld, 
>300 protein

IMAGING:
___   Imaging RENAL U.S.
No hydronephrosis.  Marked cortical thinning seen bilaterally 
consistent with chronic renal disease.  Numerous simple 
bilateral renal cysts.  Bilateral nonobstructing stones.

___   Imaging CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
There is interval development of substantial pulmonary edema.  
There are also bilateral pleural effusions, right substantially 
more than left.  Right pneumonia can be obscured by the 
combination pleural effusion or pulmonary edema and the 
assessment of the patient after diuresis is required.

___   Imaging CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
FINDINGS: Since the prior exam, there is an increased right 
pleural effusion with associated right basilar opacity. 
Additionally, obscuration of the left costophrenic angle is 
likely due to a small effusion and atelectasis. There is no 
overt pulmonary edema. The apices of the lungs are clear. There 
is no pneumothorax. The mediastinal contour is normal.  The 
heart size is moderately enlarged, and unchanged from prior 
exams. 
IMPRESSION: 
1. Small bilateral pleural effusions, greater on the right than 
the left. 
2. Bibasilar opacities, likely atelectasis. In the proper 
clinical setting, an infection would be difficult to completely 
exclude. 
3. Stable cardiomegaly.

recurrent UTIs with MDR organisms. He was initiated on 
vancomycin and meropenem in the MICU (started on given his 
history of ESBL). He was felt to be stable for the floor and was 
transfered off. He was transitioned to ceftazidime after 
cultures from ___ ED showed ceftaz sensitivity. He is to 
finish a 14 day course on ___. 

He was also continued on q48 hour bladder irrigation with NS 
until clear. Polymyxin solution was then instilled and allowed 
to dwell for 48 hours. He is to continue prophylactic bladder 
irrigation as an outpatient.
  
# A fib w/RVR: Chronic on coumadin and well controlled with PO 
medications at home. However, worsened in setting of sepsis and 
not receiving home meds at rehab due to his above hypotension.  
He was placed on metoprolol 25 mg PO BID and titrated up to 
100mg of metoprolol succinate daily. On ___, he again developed 
RVR with stable blood pressures. He was uptitrated to 150mg 
metoprolol succinate daily with good effect. Heart rate on 
discharge was in the 80's at rest.

# Cough: Some concern for PNA on admission, however, PNA not 
thought to be clinically likely. Cough improved during his 
hospitalization and her intermittently received benztropine and 
guafinesin. He also was started on ipratropium inhaler for 
anticholinergic effect.

# Hypotension: Labile BPs ranging from ___ and appeared 
volume down on admission He recieved several 250cc bolus and was 
encouraged to take PO fluids. He blood pressures responded and 
by time of transfer from the MICU to the floor his blood 
pressures were in the 110s-120s. He was noted to have 
intermittent episodes of asyptomatic hypotension into the 80's 
and 90's following dialysis that resolved without intervention 
and remitted with adjustment of end-dialysis volume repletion to 
goal BP > 110/. On discharge, his blood pressures were 
consistently in the 110's.

#Hyperkalemia: Patient with hyperkalemia to 6.3 on ___. Unclear 
etiology. Patient received additional HD session that day with 
good effect.
# ESRD w/fistula on HD: Makes minimal urine but on HD with 
___ schedule. Unclear how frequently he has been receiving 
prior to admission given his persistent hypotension. His 
creatinine is elevated on admission but he did not receive 
scheduled HD ___ illness and hypotension. He recieved HD while 
in house, last session was ___.

# Neurogenic bladder: Makes minimal UOP in setting of ESRD but 
does require straight cath when making urine. He was restarted 
on his home neosporin bladder irrigation Q48 hours and Q48H 
straight cath. He will require continued bladder irrigation q48 
hours,as an outpatient (arranged.)

# sCHF: Per his PCP, his last measured LVEF was 48%.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
- Please straight cath q48 hours and flush till clear with NS or 
neosporin, with 25 cccc of neosporin in bladder dwell between 
flushes.
- Please ensure SBPs remain >110 at the end of dialysis sessions 
to prevent hypotension and RVR.
- Cont ceftaz dosed with HD through ___

EGD REPORT (___):
Impression: Moderate esophagitis in mid-esophagus. No stricture 
identified in the esophagus 
Mild to moderate antral gastritis was seen
Otherwise normal EGD to third part of the duodenum
 
Recommendations: Return to the floor
Okay to start on clears. If does fine overnight, advance to 
pureed diet in AM PPI 40 mg PO BID. Repeat EGD in ___ to evaluate for healing of esophagitis 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
ACTIVE ISSUES:
# Esophagitis - Mr. ___ presented with regurgitation of 
liquid and solid foods without cough which is an acute change 
from his baseline cricopharyngeal dysphagia. We considered 
mechanical (stricture, web, ring) vs. functional (impaired 
motility) vs. inflammatory causes (esophagitis). The onset of 
dysphagia with solids, ie: diced chicken, that progressed to 
liquids increases likelihood of mechanical obstruction. His 
history of T2DM does increase his risk of motility dysfunction 
such as gastroparesis. However, gastroparesis is less likely to 
have such an acute onset. EGD ultimatley showed moderate 
esophagitis with mild-moderate antral gastritis. There was no 
evidence of mechanical obstruction. Esophagitis was treated with 
pantoprazole 40mg PO BID and diet advanced as tolerated. Plan to 
repeat EGD in 8wks with Dr ___ to evaluate for healing of 
esophagitis.  

# Aspiration Pneumonia - Mr. ___ dysphagia and 
regurgitation of food without coughing, which was concerning for 
silent aspiration. He was afebrile an denied chills. Laboratory 
tests demonstrated leukocytosis and CXR demonstrated a increased 
heterogeneous opacity along the medial right lung base, 
compatible with aspiration or infection. We also considered 
aspiration pneumonitis given +UA findings represent alternative 
etiology for leukocytosis. Cardiac cause unlikely given no 
evidence of volume overload on physical exam. Blood cultures 
were sent. Treatment was initiated with Vancomycin 1gm IV per HD 
protocol, Levofloxacin 750mg IV x1 and metronidazole 500mg IV x1 
on admission. Treatment was later revised to cefpodoxime 200mg 
PO post-HD and metronidazole 500mg PO Q8h. Plan to discharge the 
patient on moxifloxacin 400mg Q24h for a total of 7days of 
therapy (end on ___.

# UTI - UA on admission (+) for 90 WBC without epithelial cells. 
Urine cultures were sent and are pending. Urinary pathogens are 
being covered by antibiotics on board for pneumonia. 

# Atrial fibrillation  - One episode of Afib w/ RVR while in the 
ED in the setting of inability to tolerate PO metoprolol, which 
resolved with IV metoprolol mg x1. No recurrence while on the 
floor, therefore telemetry was discontinued. Once patient 
tolerated POs, home metoprolol was reinitiated. Of note, INR was 
3.3 during hospital course, therefore warfarin held for 1 day. 
Will instruct patient to restart warfarin at home dose and f/u 
with outpatient ___ clinic on ___.

# Anemia of chronic disease c/b macrocytic anemia  - New MCV 
elevation to 105 on admission. Hct initially hemoconcentrated to 
36, then returned to baseline of ___.  Recommend follow-up 
with outpatient PCP. Continue Epo and Venofer at HD as 
outpatient. Consider checking B12 and folate as an outpatient. 

CHRONIC ISSUES:

# Non-Ischemic Dilated CM  - Last Cardiology note in ___ 
system did not document EF and no recent ECHO was found in ___ 
system, however prior discharge summary document EF ___. No 
signs of volume overload at this time. We continued home 
metoprolol. Lasix utilized at home on non-HD days, though of 
unclear effect as patient is anuric.  Lasix held given patient 
received HD here on ___.

# ESRD on HD: Schedule TThSat.  Patient received HD at ___ on 
___. 

# HTN: BP monitored. Continued home metoprolol. 

# Gout: Continued home allopurinol.

# Hypothyroidism: Continued home levothyroxine. 

# Autonomic dysfunction: No evidence of autonomic instability.

# Sleep apnea: Patient declined CPAP  

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
- F/u blood cultures x2
- F/u urine cultures
- INR elevated to 3.3 while inpatient, therefore need f/u with 
___ clinic on ___
- GI Clinic will call to schedule appointment for f/u endoscopy 
as outpatient, however if they do not call, gave pt phone 
___
- Advance diet as tolerated from purees to soft foods over 
several days. 
- F/u macrocytic anemia with outpatient PCP.

amongst other entities.  Given the soft tissue thickening and 
defect along the posterior heel, osteomyelitis is suspected. 

 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ male w/ h/o ESRD on HD, Afib on coumadin, HTN, CHF w/ EF 
48% p/w labile BPs & tachycardia. 

ACTIVE ISSUES: 
# ? Osteomyelitis
Per wound care, ulcer has increased in size, depth, and 
severity. MRI showed concern for osteomyelitis. Debrided by 
podiatry and sent bone fragment for culture. ID consulted and 
recommended 6 weeks of vancomycin and ceftazidime dosed at HD 3x 
per week.  If culture of bones identifies an organisms, coverage 
may be narrow per ID recommendations.

#Hyperkalemia: 
HD dependent patient presented with hyperkalemia to 7.3 with 
peaked T-waves on EKG. Pt had a pint of Borscht night prior to 
admission and skipped AM HD, both of which could have 
contributed to the hyperK. Renal team consulted, patient 
underwent HD. K post-dialysis 5.2. 

#Hypotension: 
Pt has hx persistent with volume-sensitive BP regulation 
possibly secondary to hx autonomic dysfunction (no longer on 
midodrine & fludrocort). Supposedly hypotensive prior to 
admission, but normotensive in ED and during hospital stay. 
Hypotension could be ___ infection, most likely urinary, 
pneumonia highly unlikely.  Lactate was 1.8.   Bladder empty on 
scan so unable to obtain urine for UA.  Straight cath w/ 
Neomycin-Polymyxin wash Q48H and send UA, UCx when able. 
Received vanc/ cefepime in ED. Received 2g cefepime in ED, HD 
dosing 250mg qday.  Hold cefepime for now.

#ESRD: HD since ___. LUE AVF s/p operative repair for AVF 
aneurysm ___. Patient recently admitted with UTI (UCx no 
growth)for which completed course of ceftaz on ___ and he 
continues to get neomycin bladder flush and dwell q2 days. 
Hospitalized with E. coli UTI in ___. Continued home 
Finasteride 5 mg PO DAILY for urinary retention

#Afib w/ RVR: INR 1.9 on admission, continued home coumadin. 
Continued home Metoprolol Succinate XL 150 mg PO DAILY. 

#Respiratory distress: 95% on 2L NC.  No tachypnea or dyspnea.  
CXR unchanged from ___, no overwhelming signs of infection or 
volume overload. Continue home Furosemide 80 mg PO 4X/WEEK 
(___).  

CHRONIC ISSUES: 
#HTN: currently normotensive. Continued home metoprolol, hold if 
SBP<100

#CHF: Echo in ___ showed EF 48%.  No evidence of volume 
overload.  Denies SOB.  continued home Furosemide 80 mg PO 
4X/WEEK (___) 
  
#T2DM: A1c<5% in ___, not on treatment

#anemia: most likely anemia of chronic disease secondary to 
renal dysfunction.  Currently ___ increased from baseline, most 
likely due to hemoconcentration.  

#gout:continued Allopurinol ___ mg PO DAILY 

#hypothyroidism: most recent TSH 6.0 on ___. continued 
Levothyroxine Sodium 100 mcg PO DAILY

IMAGING: 
___ CXR:  
PORTABLE FRONTAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  The lung volumes are 
exceedingly low.  
Opacity at the right lung base is improved from prior and is 
likely a 
combination of atelectasis and pleural effusion.  Pneumonia 
cannot be entirely excluded.  There is improved aeration of the 
right upper lobe compared to prior.  Retrocardiac opacity may 
also reflect atelectasis but infection cannot be excluded, and 
there is likely a trace left pleural effusion.  There is no 
pneumothorax. Heart is moderately enlarged.  A tortuous and 
calcified aorta is again noted. There is mild distention of the 
stomach. 
.
___ CXR:   
There is a new right IJ line with tip in the SVC.  There is no 
pneumothorax.  There continues to be volume loss in both lower 
lungs and a large right and small left pleural effusion. 

CXR ___: IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___: Large right pleural effusion is unchanged, still obscures 
most of the right lung.  Only the left upper lung is visibly 
clear.  Left lower lobe is also partially obscured and could be 
atelectatic or even consolidative.  Moderate
enlargement of the cardiac silhouette is longstanding.  No 
pneumothorax.  Left jugular line ends in the mid SVC.

disease, HTN, CHF, afib on warfarin who was admitted from 
dialysis for Afib with RVR, hypotension, hyperkalemic acidosis 
and leukocytosis. 
 
# Hypotension: Resolved following fluid resuscitation and 
correction of tachycardia and electrolyte dyscrasia.  Was likely 
secondary to his rapid ventricular rate with inadequate filling 
times with a component of relative hypovolemia. Ddx also 
included infection given leukocytosis on admission, lactate, and 
possible infiltrate on initial CXR as well as line exposure, 
however cultures were negative as of discharge and leukocytosis 
resolved.  Patient was treated with empirically with 
vanc/cefepime, however this was discontinued after ~ 48 hours 
due to lack of fevers and negative culture date and no clear 
source of infection.  Patient was continued on his home 
anti-hypertensive regimen, BPs remained stable. 

# Anemia: chronic, likely related to ESRD.  MCV was slightly 
elevated.  Previous iron studies in ___ c/w anemia of 
chronic disease, vit b12 normal at that time, folate normal in 
___.  Patient was asymptomatic - not tachy, no 
light-headedness/dizziness.  H/H was noted to have dropped since 
admission 12.3/40.3---->8.6/26.7, as had all cell lines. Was 
thouht likely related to marrow suppression from acute illness 
vs med effect (vancomycin).  Dilution also a possibility from 
ESRD and anuria.  Vitamin B12 and folate were noted to be within 
normal limits.  Smear was without schistocytes.  Recommend 
outpatient monitoring of CBC.

# Thrombocytopenia: Unclear etiology, 4T score = 3 making HIT 
unlikely.  All cell lines were noted to have decreased as above. 
 There was concern for marrow suppression, med effect, vs 
dilutional effect d/t fluid retention from ESRD, anuria.  There 
were no active signs of bleeding.  CBCs were monitored daily.  
Would recommend outpatient monitoring of CBC.
  
# ESRD: On date of admission, patient did not recieve dialysis 
___ hypotension; his potassium was > 7 with peaked T waves on 
EKG and he was anuric. nephrology and transplant, were unable to 
access the port, placed temp HD line and patient was dialyzed on 
___.  ___ performed fistulogram and thrombectomy on ___: per 
report achieved excellent angiographic result and patent fistula 
with palpable thrill at end of procedure.  Underwent HD via AV 
fistula on ___ without complications.
 
#Afib with RVR: Patient presented in RVR with low blood pressure 
related to poor filling times. Dilt gtt was started in MICU, 
returned to normal rate, then was continued on home metoprolol 
succinate 100mg daily.  Warfarin was held initially due to 
needed thrombectomy for thrombosed LUE AV fistula.  INR 
subsequently became subtherapeutic, he was restarted on warfarin 
on ___.  Per patient's outpatient PCP, was not to be bridged 
d/t bleeding risk.  He is anticoagulation is monitored at his 
dialysis unit and his outpatient nephrologist, Dr. ___.

# New O2 requirement - Resolved.  Patient required 2L O2 while 
inpatient, no O2 requirement at home.  Was likely related to 
pleural effusions and atalectasis.  Infection considered 
unlikely etiology given negative workup to date, lack of fevers 
and resolution of leukocytosis.  Patient was weaned off of O2 on 
___ after fluid removal at dialysis.  Patient's caretakers were 
advised to perform chest ___ ___ per day.
 
Chronic Issues:  
#Hyptohyroidism: continued on home Levothyroxine  

#Gout - continued on home allopurinol

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
# afib w/RVR - patient presented with afib w/RVR and associated 
hypotension, rate was controlled with dilt gtt and patient was 
then transitioned to his home metoprolol dose. rate remained 
well-controlled thereafter. 
# anticoagulation - patient's INR dropped in setting of holding 
coumadin - was held given need for ___ procedure (fistula 
thrombectomy). Patient was restarted on warfarin without 
bridging per PCP's (Dr. ___ recommendations given concern 
for bleeding. His INRs are monitored at his dialysis sessions by 
outpatient nephrologist Dr. ___. He should receive 3 mg 
warfarin on ___. Next dose to be determined by Dr. ___. 
Recommend next INR check on ___ at dialysis.
# Left heel wound - patient with left heel wound, does not 
appear infected, no purulent drainage. Patient will be seen by 
Dr. ___ follow-up this ___ (patient's 
family set up appt themselves, are aware of time and location).
# Right-sided pleural effusion - patient with right sided 
pleural effusion, chronic, required supplemental O2 (2L by nasal 
cannula), was weaned off on day of discharge. sats remained in 
the ___ on RA. Recommend follow-up to monitor oxygen/respiratory 
status and to ensure effusion is resolving/stable. Patient's 
family instructed by Dr. ___ to perform chest ___ ___ daily to 
assist with keeping airways patent.
# ESRD: patient with ESRD on HD. left AV fistula was thrombosed 
on admission, ___ performed thrombectomy. AV fistula was able to 
be used for dialysis on ___. He receives dialysis on 
___ at ___ and is followed by Dr. ___ 
as an outpatient. Per patient's PCP, ___ should resume

Acute Issues
========
#DYSPNEA: Pt was reporting resolution of dyspnea on encounter 
mid-dialysis.  He was initially maintained on low levels of 
supplemental oxygen via nasal cannula, though this was rapidly 
weaned after dialysis.  He maintained excellent oxygen 
saturations on room air and denied dyspnea through the remainer 
of his admission.

#CHF: Patient presented with elevated BNP on admission though 
baseline unknown. He received 1 session of hemodialysis prior to 
arrival on the floor with good effect on his dyspnea as above.  
He appeared euvolemic for the remainder of his admission.
 
#HEARING LOSS: Patient incidentally noted hearing loss during 
this admission and found to have significant cerumen impaction 
in both ears.  He was discharged with a prescription for 
carbamide peroxide drops to instill for 1 wk prior to next PCP 
visit, at which point cerumen should be manually removed.

Chronic Issues
=========
#ESRD: Patient received scheduled ___ dialysis session 
in-house.  He was continued on his pre-admission renal regimen.

#AFIB: Patient was continued on his pre-admission coumadin, with 
recommendation to titrate following discharge for mildly 
subtherapeutic INR.  He was continued on his pre-admission 
metoprolol.  His heart rate was monitored on telemetry, which 
showed no significant changes in his rhythm.

#PRESUMED OSTEOMYELITIS: Patient received his scheduled 
vancomycin dose during dialysis and his ceftazidime on the 
floor.

#ANEMIA: Patient's hematocrit was at baseline with so clinical 
signs of active bleeding.  No further intervention.

#HTN: Patient was continued on his pre-admission metoprolol and 
lasix regimen.

#GOUT: Patient was continued on pre-admission allopurinol.

was not reproducible in the MICU and may represent a false 
reading as it was taken on his radial. The patient never 
expressed chest pain, lightheadedness or feeling presyncopal. 
Due to a lack of beds, the patient was emergently dialysed in 
the ED and then admitted to the MICU. His electrolytes were 
rechecked and his potassium had normalized to 3.9. He remained 
hemodynamically stable throughout his stay in the ICU without 
any further hypotensive events.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___, 

It was a pleasure caring for you at the ___. 

You were admitted with high potassium levels. This is likely 
related to eating high potassium foods. Further, your dialysis 
center can likely decrease the dose of potassium you get during 
your dialysis sessions. Our nephrologists have reached out to 
them to discuss this. 

While you were here, you underwent dialysis and your potassium 
returned to normal. Remember, high potassium levels can kill you 
so eat low potassium foods and go to dialysis.

Weigh yourself every morning, call MD if weight goes up more 
than 3 lbs.

We wish you all the best, 

Your ___ Team

IMAGING
=======
___: CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
FINDINGS: 
AP portable upright view of the chest.   Patient's chin obscures 
the superior mediastinum and portions of the lung apices.  The 
lung volumes are low also limiting evaluation.  The heart is 
moderately enlarged though this appears unchanged.  Retrocardiac 
space is poorly assessed.  Otherwise, there is no evidence of 
pneumonia.  No large effusion or pneumothorax.  Mediastinal 
contour stable.  Bony structures are intact.
 
IMPRESSION: 
No convincing evidence for pneumonia though left lung base 
poorly visualized. Cardiomegaly unchanged.
 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ man with complex medical history including atrial 
fibrillation on Coumadin, end-stage renal disease 
(multifactorial secondary to hypertension and obstructive 
nephropathy) on HD ___ since ___, 
hypertension, CHF, Gout, PVD, cricopharyngeal dysphagia ___ neck 
fracture with quadriparesis, history of autonomic dysfunction, 
persistent volume-sensitive BP dysregulation who presented with 
weakness, chills, and diaphoresis at a dental appointment. 

BRIEF HOSPITAL COURSE: 
# Fevers/Chills/Hypotension/Tooth Pain: Patient presented to his 
dentist with right mandibular molar pain. He saw dentist day of 
admission where dentists performed a manipulation of the tooth, 
at which point patient developed symptoms suggestive of possible 
transient bacteremia (hypotension, weakness, chills). He was 
transferred to ___ and was noted to have purulent drainage on 
exam. He initially received piperacillin-tazobactam in the ED. 
Unasyn was subsequently added on for further coverage. After 
treatment with antibiotics, patient's blood pressure improved. 
Patient's mental status remained at baseline. For completeness a 
CXR performed which was unrevealing for a source of infection. 
UA/urine culture also performed which was negative. Etiology of 
the presentation is thought to be secondary to dental infection 
with transient bacteremia in the setting of dental manipulation. 
He was discharged on metronidazole 500 mg PO Q8H with end date 
___ to cover for anaerobes (note: he has already been on 
vancomycin and ceftazidime for osteomyelitis of the heel and was 
continued on that during hospitalization). He is set to 
follow-up with his dentist, Dr. ___ to assess likely dental 
infection, and with his oral surgeon.  

His INR was noted to be low at 1.4 however his coumadin was not 
changed as flagyl will likely elevated his INR.

Transitional Issues:
======================
-Continue flagyl for 7 day course (___)
-Please have patient follow-up with Dr. ___ dentist, 
for further evaluation of his tooth infection and possible xrays 
to rule out deeper infection
-Consider transition to oral suppressive therapy for 
osteomyelitis in the future (could consider moxifloxacin and 
doxycycline)
-Please check INR on ___ at HD and fax results to Dr. ___ HD ___
-Please obtain repeat urinalysis as outpatient as urinalysis 
during hospitalization showed 3 RBC.
-Follow-up Blood cultures from ___, urine culture from ___

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,

You were admitted to the hospital with weakness, low blood 
pressure and chills after being seen for a possible tooth 
infection at the dentist. You were given additional antibiotics 
and your symptoms resolved. We think that your symptoms were 
caused by a brief episode of bacteria in your blood. You were 
started on one additional antibiotic called Flagyl (or 
metronidazole) to treat a possible tooth infection. You should 
take this for one week. 

Dr. ___ is working on setting up a follow-up appointment for 
you with your dentist to evaluate for further treatment of your 
dental infection. 

You were noted to have a low INR while you were in house. You 
should continue to take your home coumadin dose and have your 
INR checked again on ___ at hemodialysis. 

It was a pleasure taking care of you!

with trace left pleural effusion.
2. Bibasilar airspace opacities could reflect compressive 
atelectasis but
infection is not excluded.
3. Interval improvement in mild pulmonary edema.
 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ yo M with PMH ESRD on HD, afib on coumadin, HTN, CHF with EF 
48% p/w generalized weakness.

ACTIVE ISSUES
# Weakness
Unclear etiology at presentation. One possibility included a UTI 
so initially started on antibioitics, however U/A was not 
convincing and no leukocytosis so antibiotics were discontinued. 
 No cardiac symptoms suggesting ACS or focal symptoms to suggest 
infection.  No neuro findings to suggest CVA or neuropathic.  He 
had signs of volume depletion so he was given IVF with some 
improvement in weakness.  Also the possibility that neomycin 
bladder dwells could have been causing the weakness so the 
volume of neomycin was decreased.  At discharge patient felt 
back to his baseline strength and was safe for discharge.
  
# Hyperkalemia 
Patient presented with K of 7.1 and EKG showed peaked T waves.  
He was given one dose of kayexelate and had two rounds of HD.  
On discharge his K normalized and his EKG was at baseline.

# ESRD: 
On HD ___, Th, Sa. Missed Th HD so got HD ___ and had a repeat 
HD on ___ for ___ schedule.  Continued cinacalcet, nephrocaps, 
and sevelemer.    

CHRONIC ISSUES
# Anemia 
This is a chronic, but at presentation he is above baseline and 
most likely hemoconcentrated. There was no concern for active 
bleeding at this time.  His hematocrit was stable throughout the 
hospitalization.
 
# Atrial fibrillation 
Continued his home dose of coumadin and metoprolol XL.  No 
issues during hospitalization and he was discharged 
hemodynamically stable.  

# Hypertension
Continued home dose of metoprolol.

# CHF  
Continued lasix and metoprolol per home regimen. 
 
# Gout
Continue home dose allopurinol. 
 
# Hypothyroidism: 
Contine home dose Levothyroxine.
