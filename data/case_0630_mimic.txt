Brief Hospital Course:
___ is a ___ year old woman who found down with 
aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage. CTA revealed aneurysm at the 
left vertebrobasilar junction. Urine was positive for cocaine on 
admission. Her course was complicated by respiratory failure, 
infection, severe vasospasm and stroke. The patient's code 
status was ultimately changed to comfort measures only on 
___ and she was terminally extubated. Time of death 1700 on 
___.

#aSAH
She was admitted to ICU for close monitoring. ___ placed for 
strict SBP <140. She was started on Nimodipine 60q4 for 
vasospasm prophylaxis and started on IVF @100cc/hr. EVD was 
placed at OSH and was kept open at 15. Post-EVD placement, small 
tract hematoma noted at EVD site. CSF was sent for culture upon 
admission to ___ and was negative. On ___ she was taken to 
angio suite and underwent cerebral angiogram for balloon 
assisted coiling of aneurysm. Her groin was perclosed and the 
patient remained flat x2 hours. Post-procedure, the EVD was 
dropped to 10 above the tragus. On ___, the patient was not 
following commands; she was simultaneously febrile to 103 and 
EEG was placed to rule out seizures. EEG was negative for 
epileptiform seizures on ___ with generalized slowing 
consistent with encephalopathy. NCHCT obtained on ___ was 
stable. CTA head was completed on ___ which showed patient 
in severe vasospasm, patient was started on pressors to maintain 
SBP >140.  EEG was discontinued on ___ given no seizure 
activity. EVD was raised to 15 on ___. Nimodipine was held due 
to worsening hypotension. TCDs ___ showed diffuse vasospasm. 
Head CT showed large territory left hemispheric infarct. She was 
taken to angio with unsuccessful attempted balloon angioplasty, 
and received verapamil and nitro for vasorelaxation. Please see 
report in OMR for full details. She continued to receive triple 
vasopressors to maintain SBP 180-200. She was also started on 
milrinone. CT head on ___ showed stable infarcts. She was taken 
back to angio suite on ___ for balloon angioplasty for 
treatment of her vasospasm. MRI was obtained on ___ which 
confirmed acute infarcts in the L MCA and L PCA territories. She 
continued on vasopressors and milrinone through ___. Dr. ___ 
met with the patient's son ___ on ___ and discussed prognosis

again on ___. C diff PCR was positive and she was started on 
vanco and flagyl. Antibiotics were discontinued on ___ with the 
change in her code status to CMO.

#Acute respiratory failure
The patient was intubated for airway protection. The patient was 
tachypneic on ___ and remained ventilated, requiring 
increased sedation for vent synchrony. Worsening respiratory 
status on ___ requiring increased sedation. She remained on the 
ventilator-dependent throughout her hospitalization. She was 
terminally extubated on ___.

on ___ for agitation. She is s/p phenobarb taper. 

#Pulmonary nodules
The patient was incidentally found to have pulmonary nodules 
bilaterally measuring up to 3-4 mm on her CTA. For incidentally 
detected multiple solid pulmonary nodules 
smaller than 6mm, no CT follow-up is recommended in a low-risk 
patient, and an optional CT follow-up in 12 months is 
recommended in a high-risk patient. Follow-up does not pertain 
to this case given patient now CMO.
