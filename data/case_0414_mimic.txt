History of Present Illness:
The patient is a ___ history of stage III ovarian cancer s/p 
TAH-BSO, small bowel resection, heated intraperitoneal 
chemotherapy in ___ (BRCA2
mutation, history of pancreatic cysts for which we have been 
following) and multiple small bowel obstructions previously.  
She recalls about 6 discrete episodes of SBO, often will allow 
similar episodes of pain to pass without presenting to hospital, 
and has been inpatient twice managed non-operatively.  Her last 
obstruction was in ___ and she was admitted to our service,
given IV hydration, made NPO, and no NG tube was placed.  A CT 
scan at that time showed a transition point in the deep pelvis 
distally.  She was discharged the following day after resolution 
of her symptoms.
    Today she says she awoke around 5 am with a "stomach ache 
like none other," similar to her prior episodes of obstruction.  
The pain was diffuse, waxing and waning / crampy.  After the 
onset of pain she had a small bowel movement - she cannot recall 
the last time she passed flatus.  The pain also seems to be 
worsened with certain positions.  She endorses some nausea, and 
she stopped
eating and began to focus on drinking liquids thinking that she 
would not tolerate food further at this time.  No fever, chills.
