Given his persistent altered mental status, he was intubated by
EMS with succinylcholine and etomidate, and also required
additional Versed for sedation. Per ED nursing report, he was
following commands with nodding yes and shaking head no. 

In the ED,  
Initial Vitals: ___, 18, 95% intubated 

Exam notable for: Abrasion to left parietal area. Intubated, 27
at the teeth. Neuro exam: intubated, not responding to painful
stimuli

Labs: 
- WBC 6.9, HGB 13.5, 186

Utox positive for benzos 
UA overall unremarkable 

Imaging:  
CT spine: No acute cervical fractures identified.
NCHCT: No acute intracranial process 

CXR: Endotracheal tube terminates approximately 4.6 cm above the
carina.  Low lung volumes, which accentuate the bronchovascular 
markings.  Given this, prominence of the central pulmonary
vasculature may be due to vascular engorgement/component of
edema, underlying aspiration not excluded.  Difficult to
accurately assess the cardiomediastinal silhouette due to 
patient
position. 
  
CTA C/A/P: 1. Bibasilar pulmonary consolidations consistent with

Patient oblique in position.  Endotracheal tube terminates 
approximately 4.6 cm above the carina.  Low lung volumes, which 
accentuate the bronchovascular markings.  Given this, prominence 
of the central pulmonary vasculature may be due to vascular 
engorgement/component of edema, underlying aspiration not 
excluded.  Difficult to accurately assess the cardiomediastinal

CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST Study Date of ___ 
No acute intracranial process.

CT C-SPINE W/O CONTRAST Study Date of ___  
No acute cervical fractures identified.

CTA CHEST  Study Date of ___

aspiration. 
2. No acute intra-abdominal findings.

breathing s/p intubation. 

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: 
=====================
[] If hypoglycemia recurs, consider sending at time of 
hypoglycemia: insulin, c peptide, proinsulin, BHB, sulfonylurea 
and meglitinide screen 
[] Consider need for cardiac monitor to evaluate for underlying 
arrhythmias 
[] Please make sure to follow up with the Nutritionist from the 
Bariatric Surgery group to help you manage your food choices.
[] Please see your PCP ___ ___ days. 
[] Patient was provided with educational materials on 
appropriate diet choices.

ACUTE ISSUES: 
===============
# Syncope
Witnessed collapse while at ___ and received bystander 
CPR but unclear whether he ever lost a pulse. Details of event 
not available. DDX includes potentially hypoglycemia triggered 
syncope, seizure, less likely cardiac arrest. Of note, patient 
reports history of dizzy episodes, so prior undocumented 
hypoglycemia or cardiac arrhythmia is possible. This admission, 
he had no no events on tele, trops neg x2, TTE showed no 
abnormalities. He was normoglycemic. EEG was unremarkable. 
Infectious workup negative aside from CT chest showing bibasilar 
consolidations c/w aspiration. 

# Hypoglycemia 
Hypoglycemic to 40 upon EMS arrival. No history of DM, not on 
insulin. History of bariatric surgery. He endorses a history of 
these episodes since his surgery, explaining that these episodes 
have been occurring a few times a week since the surgery. He 
also endorses poor dietary choices. This admission he was 
normoglycemic. If hypoglycemia recurs, consider sending at time 
of hypoglycemia: insulin, c peptide, proinsulin, BHB, 
sulfonylurea and meglitinide screen. He was given a lot of 
education regarding checking his FSBS with a glucometer as well 
as acarbose should he experience hypoglycemia unresponsive to po 
sugar.

# Respiratory failure 
Intubated in the field in the setting of altered mental status 
and irregular breathing after collapsing. He was rapidly 
extubated after ICU admission with improvement of mental status 
with weaning of sedation. He was stable on RA. 

CHRONIC ISSUES: 
=================
#HTN: initially held losartan but restarted by discharge 

#Psoriasis 
#Psoriatic arthritis: on outpatient infusions q6 weeks of 
biologic Ixekizumab (Taltz)
