Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the transplant surgery service. 
Serial exams were performed. She was maintained on a heparin 
drip and this was titrated to a therapeutic PTT range. She was 
kept on bowel rest in preparation for intervention. On HD #2 she 
went to interventional radiology where a fistulagram was 
performed of the right upper extremity fistula. This 
demonstrated multiple areas of stenosis within the fistula as 
well as stensois centrally that were balloon dilated. In 
addition, there was fair amount of clot burden that was 
thrombectomized as well. There was no obstruction distally by 
arteriogram. The patient was transferred back to the floor 
without incidence. Post-procedure check demonstrated positive 
thrill and bruit with palpable radial pulse. The fingertips were 
pink and warm though the patient did note persistent numbness in 
the fingertips likely from distal emboli. Hand surgery was 
consulted and recommended no further anticoagulation needs. The 
heparin drip was discontinued and her diet was advanced to 
regular which she tolerated. 
Hemodialysis was attempted on HD 3. Initially when needles were 
placed, there was high venous pressure with minimal bloodflow. A 
new needle placement was attempted and clots were present in the 
fistula needle, so the dialysis treatment attempt was 
terminated. The hand remained well perfused with good distal 
pulses although there was mottling in the hand.
She was taken back to ___ on HD 4, and venogram demonstrated 
reoccurence of the distal stenosis near the venous anastomsis, 
this was again angioplastied, however the radiologist felt this 
was not a satisfactory place to place a stent due to 
interference with dialysis needle placement in the future. Clot 
was removed as well. The hand pain and numbness resolved. 
On HD 5 she returned for HD. Initially access was obtained 
through the distal buttonhole, however, there was high 
resistance to venous outflow. A new needle was placed distally 
and the high venous pressures resolved and the patient was able 
to complete dialysis without complication. She remained afebrile 
with stable vital signs. She was discharged to home. She was 
given information for follow up in the ___ or she 
will follow up with her prior access ___ further cares.

worsening hand pain, numbness/tingling, cold or blue 
hand/fingers, sores developing on the fingers, or any other
