History of Present Illness:
Ms. ___ is a ___ year old woman, with past history of Child's 
Class C-ETOH Cirrhosis c/b ascites, HE, SBP, and HRS, Roux-en-Y 
Gastric Bypass c/b recurrent anastamotic stricutres requiring 
multiple endoscopic dilations, prior history of GJ anastamotic 
performation in setting of endoscopic GJ stricture dilation 
requiring ex-lap, GJ take down, G-G anastaomosis. Patient was 
previously discharged 3 days ago, for acute encephalopathy, 
nausea/vomiting s/p venting G-tube placement, fevers, 
hyponatremia, and now being re-admitted for inability to 
tolerate PO intake.  
 Patient was recently hospitalized from ___ to ___. 
Patient was initially admitted for worsening encephalopathy and 
nausea/vomiting. Patient was initially found to have repetitive 
movements of non-responsiveness and thought to be ___ to 
seizures and encephalopathy. EEG done did not show frank seizure 
activity, and patient restarted on levitraectam and home 
lactulose and rifaxamin. Patient also was educated on venting 
her G-tube, with inability to drainage at home. Patient has 
intermittent nausea/vomiting despite G-tube drainage. Patient 
had scheduled G-tube flushes, and was given dronabinol. Patient 
did have a fever thought to be ___ to aspiration pneumonitis, 
and was given ceftazidime/fagyl for 48 hours. Patient also found 
to have acute anemia, and was given 1 unit PRBC, and maintained 
on pantoprazole BID. Also found to have hyponatremia, which 
improved with 50 gram albumin. and worsened with Lasix. Patient 
was continued on spirionolactone, furosemide, and Bactrim daily 
for SBP prophylaxis, and midodrine 5 mg TID, and thiamine, 
folate, multivitamin.  
 She then went home, and patient reports that she continued to 
have intermittent nausea/vomiting. She then re-presented to the 
ED on ___ after presenting to an OSH on ___ with CT scan, and 
found to have a clogged J-tube and ? SBO/ileus. Patient then 
underwent replacement of the tube with a new ___. Patient was 
then found to have some surrounding erythema round the site. 
Patient states that her last bowel movement was on ___, and is 
passing flatus. She states that the J-tube has been working, and

Brief Hospital Course:
Key Information for Outpatient ___ yo female w/ PMHx 
significant for EtOH cirrhosis c/b ascites, HE, and SBP, and 
obesity s/p Roux-n-Y gastric bypass (___) c/b stricture of 
gastrojejunal anastomosis & internal hernia resulting in SBO s/p 
multiple endoscopic dilations. Course has been further c/b 
perforation requiring takedown of old gastrojejunostomy and 
gastrogastric anastomosis, s/p feeding jejunostomy (___) c/b 
N/V ___ ileus, s/p venting G-tube on ___. J-tube feeding was 
c/b multiple instances of intolerance despite short term bowel 
rest with slow re-initiation of feeds. Abdominal imaging c/w 
ileus on ___. Given suboptimal provision of enteral nutrition 
and PO intolerance, TPN started ___ for 100% energy and protein 
needs. TFs restarted on ___ at a very low rate (5cc/hr), which 
the patient appeared to be tolerating well. Plan to continue 
current nutritional plan to provide 100% nutrition via TPN and 
see outpatient provider for chronic dysmotility issues.

ACUTE ISSUES:
=============
# Nausea/Vomiting/Abdominal pain
The patient was admitted to the hospital unable to tolerate TFs 
due to severe nausea and vomiting, with copious output from 
venting G-tube. There was a concern for obstruction vs. slow 
motility. The patient had repeated studies during this 
hospitalization looking for a cause of her inability to tolerate 
PO. Multiple KUBs showed no obstruction but the patient 
continued to have a functional ileus. A percutaneous G/J tube 
check on ___ with contrast hand injection via the pre-existing 
gastrostomy and jejunostomy tubes demonstrated both tubes to be 
in appropriate positioning without evidence of obstruction. 
After discussion with motility specialists in GI, an MRI with 
small bowel follow through was ordered but could not be 
accomplished due to concerns that she would not be able to 
tolerate the PO contrast bolus. Also, per radiology 
recommendations, that was not a good study to assess motility of 
the bowels. A CT scan with contrast of her abdomen on ___ showed 
uniformly dilated small bowel loops without evidence of a 
transition point and no evidence of a mechanical obstruction. 
These findings are most compatible with an ileus. Given that the 
patient could not tolerate tube feeds, in order to offer 
nutrition the last resort was to place a PICC line on ___ and 
TPN was started ___. Trickle tube feeds at a rate of 5 cc/hr 
were restarted. Patient was continued on standing reglan to 10 
Q6.

# Nutrition - Patient was discharged on TPN and trickle tube 
feeds. 100% nutrition via TPN, tube feeds Osmolite 1.5 @ 5 
ml/hr. She will have folic acid, copper, zinc and thiamine 
supplements in TPN.

# Cellulitis - Patient developed purulence and erythema around 
the G-tube. NO fever or elevation in white count was noted. 
Doxycycline 100 mg twice a day was started on ___ and she will 
need to complete a course of 7 days until ___.

# EtOH CIRRHOSIS:
Childs C c/b ascites, HE, SBP, and HRS. MELD-Na score 22. 
Patient at this point has minimal ascites on examination. Not 
transplant candidate largely due to nutrition and complicated 
post-surgical problems. The patient was continued on lactulose 
and rifaximin. The diuretics were held in the setting of her ___ 
(which later on resolved), home furosemide 20mg qd was restarted 
by time of discharge. Midodrone 5 mg TID was continued, as well 
as TMP-SMX for SBP prophylaxis

# Anemia - Likely multifactorial given liver disease, poor 
nutrition, and chronic illness in general. The patient has been 
transfused prn with appropriate bump in H&H (5 total units 
PRBCs). There was no active concern for bleeding. Hemolysis labs 
were negative.

# ___ - Cr went from .8 as high as 1.7 during this 
hospitalization. There is likely some effect of prerenal state 
given increased output from venting G-tube, worsened iso chronic 
liver disease. After decreasing to baseline, Cr has been stable.

CHRONIC ISSUES:
===============
# H/o ROUX-EN-Y: Patient receiving zinc and copper 
supplementation through TPN with weekly monitoring of Cu levels.

# History of seizure: Continued levetiracetam 100 mg BID

# Depression: Continued escitalopram 20 mg daily

# History of alcohol abuse: Continued thiamine, folate, 
multivitamin

====================
- Weight at discharge: 97.16kg. Patient needs to continue to 
trend weights
- Cr at discharge: 0.4
- Diuretics at discharge: Furosemide 20mg PO daily
- H/H at discharge: 7.3/22.9. Patient required 5 units of blood 
transfusion during her admission. The anemia will need to be 
monitored on an outpatient basis, transfusions ordered prn. Last 
transfusion was ___.
- Patient currently has a J-tube for feeds/meds along with a 
venting G-tube, interventional radiology evaluated patient 
during this admission as above.
- Patient needs to continue with nutrition recommendations of 
100% nutrition via TPN, tube feeds Osmolite 1.5 @ 5 ml/hr. She 
will have folic acid, copper, zinc and thiamine supplements in 
TPN, has currently had weekly copper levels checked.
- Patient should have evaluation by outpatient GI motility (have 
called to set-up appointment with either Dr. ___, Dr. 
___ Dr. ___.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms ___, 

You were hospitalized for a small bowel obstruction in the 
setting of eating solid food at home. You were monitored and 
tube feeds were slowly restarted or stopped as needed based on 
what you were able to tolerate. 

Initially you continued to receive tube feeds through your 
J-tube, and you had your G-tube upsized with some improvement in 
your symptoms. However, you required G-tube venting and suction 
intermittently because of recurrent vomiting and ileus (poor 
movement in the bowels). We went down on how fast the tube feeds 
were going into your J-tube but you still did not tolerate them 
and that caused you more nausea and vomiting, as well a copious 
output from venting G-tube. So we need to stop them completely 
to prevent your symptoms. In order to give you nutrition we 
started TPN, which is nutrition that goes directly into your 
blood. That made you feel better and improved your nausea and 
vomiting. 

Moving forward you will need to continue to receive TPN, and 
trickle tube feeds (tube feeds at a very slow rate in order to 
keep your bowels working). You need to be able to take care of 
the G-tube alone at home since periodically you will need to 
vent it. You were taught by our nurses how to do that. You will 
also need to learn how to manage your TPN at home and follow the 
lessons your were taught in the hospital by our staff.

While you were hospitalized multiple teams of doctors saw ___, 
including our surgery and motility colleagues, who recommended 
special studies. These studies did not show any obstruction in 
your bowels. We believe that your intolerance to oral food is 
due to abnormal motility of your bowels. We has contacted one of 
our motility specialists for you to see as an outpatient.  If 
you are not called over the next several days please call 
___ to schedule an appointment with either 
Dr. ___, Dr. ___ Dr. ___.

Moving forward, you will continue to receive TPN nutrition, 
trickle tube feeds and you will need to take care of you G-tube 
and TPN nutrition at home. Also, you should not eat anything by 
mouth because that will make you sick and you will most probably 
come back to the hospital.  All of your medications should be 
administered through your feeding tube.

You developed some pus and redness around the G-tube. 
Doxycycline 100mg twice a day was started on ___ to prevent any 
skin infection, and you will need to complete a course of 7 days 
until ___.

Please try to wean down tramadol in the future. Also, you can go 
up on the tube feeds rate, but if you do this, you need to go up 
very slowly and in consultation with your motility doctor since 
you are very sensitive to this change and it may cause nausea 
and vomiting otherwise.

Please follow up with your doctors as listed below.  If you do 
note hear from Dr. ___ over the next several days, 
please call ___ to schedule an appointment.  

It was a pleasure taking care of you and we wish you the best! 

Sincerely,
Your ___ care team

Brief Hospital Course:
___ with EtOH cirrhosis c/b ascites/SBP/HE/HRS (Child C, MELD 
___), RYGB c/b anastomotic stricture s/p multiple EGD dilations, 
recently discharged after uncomplicated stricture dilation and 
therapeutic paracentesis, who was readmitted for abdominal pain 
and report of fever and leukocytosis. There was a low suspicion 
for infection given that she remained afebrile and HDS off abx. 
Cultures did not reveal any source of infection. Of note, she 
had a positive UTI on the previous admission with cultures 
growing VRE and therefore Linezolid had been started on ___. 
For her abdominal pain and nausea/vomiting, she underwent 
another EGD with dilation on ___. After the procedure, she 
returned to the hepatology floor and developed worsening 
abdominal pain and distension. A CXR revealed a large amount of 
free air in the peritoneum concerning for a perforation. 
Transplant surgery was consulted for further management.

On ___, the patient was taken to the operating room for 
management of the perforated gastrojejunostomy. An exploratory 
laparotomy, takedown old gastrojejunostomy, and creation of a 
gastrogastrostomy was performed (___). A feeding jejunostomy 
was additionally placed. After the abdomen was closed and the 
patient was extubated, it was recalled that a remaining hole in 
the stomach was not closed. She was therefore re-intubated, the 
abdomen was reopened and the previous gastrostomy site from the 
gastrojejunostomy was repaired. The abdomen was then closed 
without difficulty and the patient was extubated and transferred 
to the PACU in stable condition. Patient's postoperative course 
was complicated by persistent nausea/vomiting, inability to 
tolerate POs, and readmissions to the ICU. Please see below for 
a summary of her hospital course by systems.

#ICU admissions
___

#Neuro
Postoperatively, the patient returned to her baseline mental 
status shortly after extubation. Escitalopram was continued for 
depression/anxiety. Throughout her initial hospital course, she 
had intermittent episodes of severe anxiety requiring PRN 
Ativan. On ___, patient was transferred to the SICU after an 
acute change in her mental status and decreased responsiveness. 
Ammonia levels were normal at 53. She had continued bowel 
movement throughout hospital course with lactulose so hepatic 
encephalopathy not likely. Regardless, lactulose was titrated to 
maintain frequent bowel movements while in the ICU. CT 
noncontrast head showed no acute intracranial process. EEG 
revealed encephalopathy with spikes and frequent epileptiform 
discharges. Neruology was consulted and felt that her frequent 
epileptiform discharges on EEG placed her at significant risk 
for seizure at this time and Keppra 1000 BID was started with 
improvement in epileptiform discharges. Plan to continue Keppra 
until outpatient follow-up with neurology. Cipro (ppx) was 
switched to Bactrim given concern for lowering seizure 
threshold. Over the 3 days in the ICU, her mental status 
improved and she returned to her baseline. Upon transfer to the 
floor and on discharge, she was fully alert, interactive, and 
AOx3.

#Cardiovascular
Midodrine was started on ___ at 2.5mg TID for soft blood 
pressures following the operation. On ___, her hypotension 
persisted despite increase of Midodrine from 2.5 q4->q6. She 
became hypotensive to SBP ___ and was transferred to the SICU 
for further care. She was placed on levophed for blood pressure 
support. Blood pressure improved a few days later and she was 
restarted on Midodrine 5TID and transferred to the floor on ___. 


#Pulmonary
Patient was extubated after her index operation. Patient 
developed a worsening left pleural effusion and shortness of 
breath during her admission. On ___, a CT chest was obtained 
which showed a large left pleural effusion with overlying 
compressive atelectasis. Interventional pulmonology was 
consulted and a thoracentesis was performed on ___ with a 
pigtail left in place. The pigtail was discontinued on ___. 
Fluid cultures were negative although drainage was exudative 
based on Light's criteria.

#Breast
Patient was found to have a right breast mass during this 
hospitalization. A mammogram was performed on ___ which 
revealed two indeterminate masses in the right breast, BIRADS 
4B. An ultrasound guided core biopsy was performed on ___. 
Pathology report showed fibroadipose tissue with blood, fibrin, 
predominantly acute inflammatory cell infiltrate, karyorrhectic 
debris, and scattered calcifications. Breast surgery was 
consulted and it was deemed that not no need further work up in 
hospital and patient will f/u with Dr. ___ in breast 
clinic. 

#FENGI: 
Given acute abdomen secondary to perforated gastrojejunostomy, 
the patient underwent an exploratory laparotomy, takedown old 
gastrojejunostomy, gastrogastrostomy, and J-tube placement. Her 
hospital course was complicated by refractory nausea/vomiting 
and PO intolerance. Trickle TFs via NGT were started on POD2 but 
where shortly dc'ed after worsening abdominal distention and 
abdominal pain. An abdominal/pelvic CT was performed on ___ for 
her continued GI symptoms, however no significant fluid 
collections were identified. Surgical JP drain was removed on 
___ and the incision was stitched to prevent drainage of 
ascites. Trickle tube feeds were started on ___ and she was 
transferred back to the surgical floor. TPN was also started 
until tube feeds were advanced further on in her hospital course 
to goal of 60cc/hr. An upper GI with SBF was performed on ___ 
which showed severely delayed small bowel transit, with oral 
contrast not reaching the ileum after 3.5 hours. Unfortunately, 
the contrast in her abdomen was suctioned out before a delayed 
follow-through evaluation could be performed. Over the next few 
weeks, she continued to have high NGT output with multiple 
failed NGT clamp trials secondary to nausea/vomiting. A CT 
abd/pel was performed on ___ which showed mildly dilated loops 
of jejunum proximal to the J-J anastomosis without evidence of 
complete obstruction. However, contrast was found passing into 
more distal loops from the anastomosis. The surgical J-tube was 
slightly dislodaged and replaced successfully by ___ with a ___ 
MIC jejunal tube on ___. EGD was attempted on ___, however she 
had emesis during the procedure when the upper third of the 
esophagus was reached, so the procedure was aborted. EGD was 
small bowel push enteroscopy was later performed on ___ which 
showed erythema and congestion of the stomach and normal small 
bowel enteroscopy to the jejunum to 100cm. CT abd/pel was 
repeated on ___ showing prominent loops of fluid-filled small 
bowel measuring up to 4.8cm. She continued to tolerate TFs but 
had nausea/vomiting with PO trial on ___. An NGT was replaced 
on ___ with >800cc emesis. UGI with SBFT was repeated on ___ 
showing slow transit of fluid through the intestinal system, 
with contrast seen in the cecum after 7 hours and 45 minutes. 
Octreotide was started without much benefit, later discontinued. 
Additionally, she was trialed on erythromycin to improve 
motility, however this resulted in worsened nausea. She was 
transferred to the ICU on ___ for AMS. A repeat CT Abd/Pelvis 
was obtained which showed multiple dilated small bowel loops 
measuring up to 5.4 cm are mildly more distended since CT 
abdomen and pelvis ___, without a discrete transition 
point likely representing an ileus. Contrast from the prior UGI 
was noted to reach the colon and rectum. On arrival to the ICU, 
she was made NPO with NGT to LWS and J-tube to gravity. An 
abdominal ultrasound was performed on ___ which revealed no 
drainable fluid collection. Once her mental status improved, she 
was restarted back on TFs on ___ and tolerated advancement ot 
goal. Her diet was slowly advanced from ___ and by 
discharge, she was tolerating a regular diet. 

#Cirrhosis/Liver Transplant Work-up
Transplant w/u ensued during her hospitalization. On ___, TTE 
revealed LVEF 60-65%, PASP unable to calc. TTE was repeated on 
___ TTE PASP was 27 mmHg. A papsmear was done as her last 
was in ___ with finding of atypical squamous cells. Transplant 
workup was stopped given her delayed recovery from surgery and 
gastrointestinal motility issues.

#Renal
Patient developed hepatorenal syndrome during her hospital 
course with peak Cr level 6.3 on ___. Throughout her course, she 
was taken off lasix and spironolactone. On discharge, the lasix 
was titrated to 20mg daily and the spironolactone remained held.

#HEME:
Post-operatively, she required multiple blood and FFP 
transfusions for resuscitation. Throughout her hospital course 
she received 18 uPRBC, ___ FFP, 1 Plts. 

#ID: Linezolid was continued 24 hours after her operation. Fluid 
from the JP was sent for cell count which was consistent with 
peritonitis. Zosyn was started. On ___, yeast was isolated for 
JP fluid culture ___. Fluc was started on ___. Linezolid was 
discontinued on ___. JP drain output continued to be high 
with worsening renal function. On ___, JP fluid was sent for 
cell count that was consistent with SBP (wbc 2376/poly 62=1473). 
Zosyn was switched to Ceftriaxone. A PICC line was placed for 
antibiotics on ___ with tip at cavoatrial junction. ID was 
consulted on ___ with Vanco and Flagyl added. Antibiotics were 
further changed to Dapto/Zosyn (___). Rare growth of ___ 
___ was isolated. Fluconazole was started. Serum WBC on 
___ increased from 14.7 to 15.4 ua/ucx/bc sent (UA+), Zosyn was 
switched back to ceftriaxone and flagyl. Urine culture was 
negative as were blood cultures from ___ and ___. 
Ceftriaxone/Flagyl was switched to Zosyn on ___. 
Dapto/Zosyn/Flu were discontinued on ___ and patient was started 
on prophylactic SBP prophylaxis with ciprofloxacin. On ___ 
patient was switched from ciprofloxacin to Bactrim for SBP 
prophylaxis given risk of decreasing seizure threshold with 
cipro. PICC line was removed and tip culture was negative. On 
___, she was febrile to 102.3. Blood culture results revealed 
GPCs (___), eventually growing Pediococcus species. She was 
started on Linezolid and treated from ___ per ID 
recommendations.

IMAGING/STUDIES
CXR (___)- 1. Mild pulmonary vascular congestion.
2. Left retrocardiac opacity is likely due to atelectasis and a 
small
effusion, although superimposed infection may be considered in 
the appropriate
clinical setting.

RUQ U/S (___)- Liver cirrhosis with sequelae of portal 
hypertension, including ascites and
splenomegaly. Small right pleural effusion.

CXR (___)- Compared to chest radiographs ___ through 
___.
Moderate pulmonary edema which improved between ___ and 
___
has worsened again.  Concurrent pneumonia would be difficult to 
recognize. 
Mild cardiomegaly is chronic.  Pleural effusions small if any.
 
Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ is a ___ year-old woman with a history of EtOH 
cirrhosis (MELD 21 on admission) c/b ascites, SBP on ppx, HE, 
?HRS on midodrine, s/p roux-en-Y gastric bypass c/b recurrent 
anastomotic strictures requiring multiple endoscopic dilations, 
and multiple abdominal surgeries for bowel anastomosis 
complications (including bowel perforation), now on TPN for 
nutrition, who presented with volume overload. Also found to 
have possible pneumonia. Now with improvement in volume overload 
and improving PO nutrition.

ACUTE ISSUES
# Dyspnea
# Anasarca: Progressive weakness and dyspnea i/s/o significant 
weight gain. Volume overload appears to have been 
slow/progressive per patient despite med compliance, and was 
likely related to low oncotic pressure secondary to poor 
nutrition and underlying cirrhosis. She had no chest pain or EKG 
changes to suggest current or interval cardiac ischemia. TTE 
recently done with preserved biventricular systolic function, 
and no significant valvular disease. The patient was started on 
high dose IV diuresis (up to 120mg Lasix BID) with good effect 
and improvement in shortness of breath and anasarca. She was 
then switched to increased doses of PO torsemide and 
spironolactone prior to discharge.

# Pneumonia: The patient was noted to have an infiltrate on CXR 
after having a new oxygen requirement and leukocytosis to 11 at 
that time. Concern was for CAP. Patient remained otherwise 
stable. She was started on ceftriaxone and azithromycin and 
completed a course of each antibiotic (7 and 5 days, 
respectively) with improvement in symptoms.

# Malnutrition: Hx of Roux-en-Y gastric bypass c/b recurrent 
anastomotic strictures requiring multiple endoscopic dilations, 
and multiple abdominal surgeries for bowel anastomosis 
complications (including bowel perforation). Currently has 
G-tube, which has been functioning through which she receives 
her PO meds. G-tube was noted to be cracked and was exchanged on 
___ by ___ without complications. The patient was noted to be 
able to increase her PO intake, and as a result, had her TPN 
volume decreased to 1600cc at the time of discharge. The patient 
also has a fistulous tract, which has been putting out a small 
amount of greenish output from J-tube site. This is stable.

CHRONIC ISSUES
# EtOH cirrhosis: Childs B, MELD 21 on admission. EtOH cirrhosis 
c/b ascites, HE, SBP, and HRS. No varices on last EGD in ___. 
Last drink ___, not a transplant candidate per recent 
documentation due to co-morbidities. At this time no evidence of 
acute decompensation, some ascites on ultrasound, no 
encephalopathy, labs at baseline.

# Anemia: Anemic in the 7s on admission, downtrended to 6.8. 
Likely related to underlying chronic disease. Transfused 1U 
pRBCs on ___. Now stable in low-mid-7s.

# Chronic pain: In the past has seen palliative care for ongoing 
abdominal pain. Remained at baseline.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES
[] diuretic regimen on discharge: torsemide 80mg, spironolactone 
100mg
[] if patient gaining weight, should attempt to titrate 
diuretics as outpatient before being admitted - patient 
counseled extensively on calling ___ clinic if any weight 
gain.

___ - ___ given. Going home with services and home ___.
[] Follow up CT scan in ___ weeks of pulmonary nodules 
(___).
[] Reassess metoclopramide dose as needed 
[] continue to uptitrate PO intake as tolerated; can 
subsequently consider weaning down TPN

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ is a lovely ___ year old woman with EtOH cirrhosis 
complicated by ascites, SBP, HE, and HRS,s/p ___ gastric 
bypass with multiple complications including recurrent 
anastomotic strictures, bowel perforation, s/p Klebsiella 
bacteremia, who presented with abdominal pain, confusion, ___ 
and hypercalcemia of unknown etiology. Hypercalcemia and ___ 
were treated with fluids and calcitonin with improvement in 
mental status. Course was complicated by hypoxemia in setting of 
fluid administration for ___. Chest CT was done out of concern 
for malignancy which revealed small nodules and hilar 
lymphadenopathy on Chest CT. Pulmonary was consulted and 
recommended repeat CT scan in ___ weeks, and felt that nodules 
were likely infectious.

ACTIVE ISSUES:
==============
#Confusion: RESOLVED
The etiology of her confusion was felt to be hypercalcemia in 
the setting of malabsorption and renal dysfunction from ___. 
Hepatic encephalopathy was less likely given regular bowel 
movements, though she continues to be at risk of hyperammonemia 
given decompensated liver failure with gastric motility issues. 
Her neuro exam was without focal deficits and her head CT was 
negative. She was treated for hypercalcemia with calcitonin. She 
received delirium precautions and frequent reorientation, as 
well as Lactulose QID goal ___ BM per day. 

# ___: RESOLVED
Patient was believed to be in a ___ azotemima in the 
setting of poor PO intake due to confusion. Her creatinine on 
admission was 1.1 from her baseline of 0.5. It improved to 0.9 
with fluids and treatment of hypercalcemia. She then became 
fluid overloaded and was subsequently diuresed with Lasix as 
above. Her creatinine continued to downtrend back to her 
baseline, and was 0.6 at discharge. 

#s/p Hypercalcemia
#Hyperreflexia
#Concern for malignancy
Her hypercalcemia continued to be of undetermined etiology: most 
likely malignancy vs poor PO intake and immobility. Her calcium 
level was elevated to 13.2 (corrected for hypoalbuminemia) on 
admission, new from prior discharge (highest level appears to be 
around 10). iCal was also elevated at 1.46. She had elevated 
lambda and kappa chains, but with a normal ratio, which is less 
consistent with a plasma cell dyscrasia. Additionally, her blood 
smear was without any evidence of malignancy. Her 1,25 vit D was 
normal, and normal SPEP. Calcium downtrended to normal with 
initiation of calcitonin treatment per Endocrine (Calcitonin 
4u/kg for 400u BID). Her CT chest showed small nodules as above, 
concerning for malignancy vs infection, which will be followed 
up on CT by pulmonology in ___ weeks. She was given Vitamin D 
supplementation 2000u daily in the setting of Vit D deficiency. 
Her home dose of metoclopramide was decreased from 10 mg to 5mg, 
as metoclopramide could cause hyperreflexia.

#Hypoxia and pulmonary edema: RESOLVED
Patient developed orthopnea and hypoxia in the setting of 
receiving albumin infusion for ___ and hypercalcemia. Her CXR 
showed pulmonary edema. She was briefly placed on supplemental 
O2, then weaned back to RA. Tachypnea improved with IV diuresis. 
Discharged on Torsemide 60mg daily.

#EtOH cirrhosis 
#Coagulopathy 
#Volume Overload
Childs C, ___ 22 on admission. EtOH cirrhosis c/b ascites, 
HE, SBP, and HRS. No varices on last EGD in ___. No signs of 
HE. Patient reports adherence to lactulose at home. At her last 
hospitalization, patient was seen by palliative care and chose 
to continue aggressive medical management at this time. Patient 
is not a transplant candidate at this time due to complex 
medical conditions. This hospitalization, she was given TPN via 
PICC for nutrition. Her Midodrine 10 mg PO TID was continued. 
Also continued Lactulose 30 mL PO QOD, Rifaximin 550 mg PO BID 
with goal ___ BMs/day, Ciprofloxacin 500mg daily for SBP ppx, 
Folic Acid 1 mg, MVM 1 TAB, Thiamine 100 mg, Vit D. She was 
diuresed with IV Lasix this admission, and transitioned back to 
Torsemide for maintenance. Her discharge regimen was Torsemide 
60mg today and Spironolactone 50mg daily.

#Pancytopenia 
#Coagulopathy
Patient is pancytopenic, likely secondary to liver disease, 
alcohol marrow suppression, poor nutrition, and chronic illness. 
She has no evidence of active bleed at this time. WBC was 
elevated on admission relative to baseline, but her infectious 
work up was negative. She received IV Vit ___ ___. She was 
transfused blood on ___.

# Abdominal pain, chronic
Patient presented with acute worsening of chronic abdominal 
pain, now stable. CT abd/pelv showed no evidence of acute 
obstruction, showed ___ appropriately positioned, and 
evidence for ileus. No evidence infection. ___ site appeared 
clean and ___. She had no significant ascites for 
diagnostic paracentesis. C. diff negative, UCx contaminated. BCx 
NGTD. ___ remained in place, patient continued having bowel 
movements. Continued methylnaltrexone 12 mg Subcut DAILY, 
Metoclopramide 10 mg PO Q6H, Simethicone ___ mg PO QID:PRN for 
gas pain, TraMADol 100 mg PO BID, Dilaudid 2 mg PO q6h prn, 
given AMS. Her bowel regimen was continued as well: Bisacodyl 10 
mg, Polyethylene Glycol, Lactulose 30 mL Q6H

# ___
# ___ site cellulitis
# Malnutrition
She is TPN dependent given inability to tolerate full PO or full 
tube feed goals. She is s/p replacement and upsizing of her 
___ by ___ on her last admission. ___ was removed after 
discussion with consulting services on last admission, now with 
minimal drainage into a gauze bandage over the site. She has a 
PICC and she continued TPN with the hope of using her ___ in 
the future if tolerated. Nutrition followed her during this 
admission. She was discharged home with ___ for TPN.

#Hyponatremia: RESOLVED
She had hyponatremia on admission, likely secondary to liver 
disease, poor PO intake, and ___. Resolved s/p fluid 
resuscitation. 

#Chronic illness
#Chronic pain
Patient with severe and chronic pain, poor quality of life, and 
recurrent hospitalizations. Palliative Care saw patient and 
discussed goals with her. She wants aggressive medical 
management of her conditions to give her the best chance to 
live.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,

It was a pleasure taking part in your care here at ___!

Why was I admitted to the hospital?
- You were admitted for confusion, for acute injury to your 
kidneys, and for high levels of calcium.

What was done for me in the hospital?
- You were given a medicine called albumin to help your kidneys 
recover. 
- Your confusion was felt to be due to the high level of calcium 
in your body. We're not quite sure why it got so high. You were 
given a medicine to lower the amount of calcium in your body, 
and your confusion improved.
- You underwent testing to rule out reasons why you could be 
confused. 
- You developed some fluid in your lungs because of the extra 
water we gave you to help your kidneys. To help correct this, 
you were given oxygen and diuretics through the veins (to help 
you urinate out extra water). 
- You had a CT scan of your lungs to check for a cause of high 
Calcium, and were found to have several nodules. Pulmonary 
doctors have recommended that you have a repeat CT scan in ___ 
weeks to check in on these nodules and see if you need a biopsy 
or any further treatment. 

What should I do when I leave the hospital?
- Please attend all appointments as listed below.
- Please take all of your medicines as prescribed.
- Please try to limit the liquids you drink each day to 1.5L (50 
oz). This will help keep your legs from swelling up. 

When should I return to the hospital?
- Please return if your confusion comes back, if you have 
difficulty breathing, if your body becomes swollen with fluids, 
if you develop a fever or have chills, if you have severe 
abdominal pain, or any other symptom that concerns you. 

We wish you the best of luck in your health!

Sincerely,
Your ___ Treatment Team

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ is a ___ y/o woman with a PMH of alcoholic 
cirrhosis (c/b SBP, ascites, HE), non-variceal UGIB, s/p RNYGB, 
current G-tube for enteral feedings, recent admissions for
abdominal wall abscess with EC fistula and recurrent ileus/SBO 
c/b ATN, encephalopathy, and recurrent clogging of G-tube, who 
now presents with diffuse abdominal pain and nausea.

#Acute on chronic abdominal pain
#Opioid induced constipation 
#Concern for ileus
Recently admitted with abdominal pain, nausea, and emesis 
thought secondary to recurrent ileus or intermittent small bowel 
obstruction and now presents with similar symptoms; main 
presenting symptom right now is abdominal pain. CT abdomen and 
pelvis negative for acute obstruction but did demonstrate 
extensive fecalization and findings consistent with slow 
transit. Her symptoms are likely worsened by chronic opioid use, 
and on her prior admission, she was placed on simethicone and 
advised to limit her opioid use. Has not taken tramadol in 1 
week due to her pharmacy not having it. Unlikely SBP, on ppx. 
Unlikely to represent complication of prior abdominal wall 
abscess given the reassuring CT findings. Med rx refill history 
shows that she was started on methylnaltrexone and Linzess, 
however patient is unsure if she has been getting these. These 
meds were not on her pre-admission or discharge medication lists 
on her last admission. After speaking with patient's boyfriend 
who manages her medications, it was determined that she does 
have a Linzess as well as methylnaltrexone at home, however was 
not being given these medications because he was following the 
last discharge paperwork medication list. Spoke with transplant 
surgery regarding her JP drain, they will not see her on this 
admission as her drain is functioning well and there is no 
purulent drainage or complications currently.
The following was done on this admission:
-Continued home tramadol 50 mg PO BID and hydropmorphone 2 mg 
daily--minimize opioid use where possible
-Continued home lactulose/rifaximin to ensure regular bowel 
movements
-We are reinitiating Linzess and methylnaltrexone on discharge.
-Recommended to ___ that she should be having ___ bowel 
movements per day with lactulose, and uptitration of dosage if 
she is not stooling this frequently. 
-Continued ondansetron ___ mg IV q8h PRN: nausea, vomiting
-Continued metoclopramide 5 mg PO q6h 
-Continued home Simethicone 40-80 mg PO QID:PRN bloating 

___
Likely in the setting of tube feeds being held overnight ___. 
Tube feeds were restarted on ___ evening. On ___ prior to 
discharge we gave her 25 g of 5% albumin. Labs were not 
rechecked as this was felt to be well explained by her tube 
feeds being held and will expect it to quickly resolve.

#Alcoholic cirrhosis
Previously complicated by hepatic encephalopathy, SBP, and 
ascites. Followed by Dr. ___ cirrhosis, MELD-Na 
20 on admission. Checked daily MELD labs.
-HE: lactulose and rifaximin through PEG
-SBP: continued home ciprofloxacin
-Ascites: continued torsemide
-Varices: EGD ___ with diffuse friability of stomach seen 
with oozing, no intervenable lesions, no varices. 
-Coagulopathy: secondary to cirrhosis, received a trial of 
vitamin K during recent hospitalizations with only limited 
improvement in INR
-Transplant w/u: per previous documentation, not a candidate due 
to comorbidities
-Continued home midodrine 10 mg PO TID

#Poor appetite
#Tube feeds
#S/P RNYGB abdominal wall abscess and enterocutaneous fistula
Chronic tube feeding dependence via G-tube, replaced on her last 
hospitalization. Was having nausea at home which has now 
resolved. Home TF regimen: Osmolite 1.5 @ 80 mL/hr x 12
hours flush 50 mL q6h. reports that she still eats along with 
her tube feeds, proximately 2 meals per day approximately 2 
small meals a day such as cereal or a sandwich. Initially on 
admission she was cautiously placed on a liquid diet, however 
her diet was advanced to a regular diet on the morning of ___ 
as she was feeling better and had an appetite. Tube feeds were 
restarted on ___ night, which the patient tolerated well. 
Nutrition service assisted with tube feed recommendations.

_______________
CHRONIC ISSUES
#Epileptiform seizures
Continued home Keppra 1000 mg PO BID

#GERD
Continued home omeprazole 40 mg daily

#Anemia
Stable during admission, will continue to monitor.

History of Present Illness:
___ y.o. woman with active ETOH use disorder c/b cirrhosis with 
ascites, HE, SBP, obesity s/p RYGB ___ years ago) c/b 
anastamotic stricture w/ chronic daily emesis and recent SBO s/p 
surgical repair ___ at ___) and multiple 
hospitalizations at ___ for ascites, fatigue, hyponatremia, 
w/ recent admission for esophageal stricture s/p dilation w/ NJ 
tube placement(discharged ___ re-presenting for abdominal 
pain and dry heaving.

Patient with several years of daily emesis since RYGB ___ years 
ago which was complicated by esophageal stricture. Also subacute 
abdominal pain generally improved after receiving paracentesis. 
On recent admission, the patient had EGD with balloon dilation 
of NJ tube and was tolerating full liquids on day of discharge. 
She continued to have daily emesis, and it was determined that 
she would follow up as an outpatient for repeat EGD with 
stenting. Regarding her abdominal pain, the patient felt 
improvement after paracentesis (4.5 L removed, no e/o SBP). She 
was continued on SBP PPX. Of note the patient also had HRS with 
normalization of Cr on day of discharge. She was discharged on 
midodrine. 

On this admission, the patient comes in with recurrent abdominal 
pain and dry heaving and emesis 40x in last 24 hours. Most 
recently w/ specs of blood. Desribed as diffuse abdominal pain, 
radiating to the back like "knives in her stomach", similar to 
pain in the past when she was young and had a ruptures cyst. 
Exacerbated by episodes of emesis and dry heaving. Because of 
the stricture, patient says she is unable to tolerate liquids, 
medications, or even her saliva. Was discharged w/ oxycodone but 
It didn't help (though may have not been able to keep it down). 
Feels like this abdominal pain is different than abdominal pain 
she was experiencing on recent admission. No diarrhea, no melena 
no BRBPR. NO fevers/chills/nightsweats.

Of note, patient tells me she had a "weird" sensation that came 
on at the end of urination. Not very similar to UTIs she had in 
the past but maybe beginning of one. no hematuria.

(w/ multiple complications, prior J-tube, current G-tube for 
enteral feedings) recently discharged on ___ (LOS 4 weeks) for 
abdominal wall abscess s/p I&D x3 (ECF at prior J-tube site s/p 
CTX/flagyl) s/p drain placement, admitted with c/f volume 
overload, found to have pSBO, severe constipation with course 
c/b ___ ___ CIN, hyponatremia, now resolved.

ACUTE ISSUES:
=============
# Abdominal pain
# Constipation 
# Partial SBO, resolved: 
Patient presented with worsening abdominal pain to the ED, and 
CT A/P revealed large stool burden, likely in the setting of 
opioid medication use. Patient was started on aggressive bowel 
regimen but developed worsening nausea. KUB showed air-fluid 
levels concerning for partial bowel obstruction. NGT was placed 
for decompression and G tube was set to gravity; patient was 
NPO. Patient continued to stool and her symptoms resolved. She 
was able to tolerate po and NGT was removed. Tube feeds were 
restarted ___ pm without any complications. 

Of note, there was no evidence of infection around drain site or 
G tube, and only minimal ascites thus could not rule out SBP but 
had low suspicion for infectious etiology. Cipro was continued 
for SBP ppx.Pain medications were decreased this hospitalization 
with plan for discharge on lower chronic doses, as tolerated. 

# ___ ___ CIN
# Oliguria
Patient presented with mild ___ and was thought to be 
intravascularly depleted, for which her diuretics were held and 
she was given albumin for fluid resuscitation. Cr continued to 
rise, however, to peak of 4.8, and patient developed oliguria 
and a new oxygen requirement. Given timing of deterioration (~2 
days post-CT with contrast), symptoms were attributed to CIN. 
Nephrology followed the patient in-house. She made an excellent 
recovery with normalization of urine output and Cr back to 1.0. 
Diuretics were held until day of discharge and restarted at a 
lower dose of torsemide 20 mg daily. 

# Abdominal abscess s/p I&D, drain placement:
drain fell out during the course of hospitalization and was 
replaced by ___. No increased drainage, purulence or other signs 
of infection noted. Wound care recs provided by Transplant 
surgery team, which was following in house. 

# Alcoholic cirrhosis:
Followed by Dr. ___. Last drink ___. MELD 22, CP B-C. 
- HE: not active, but with positive history. Continued on 
rifaximin and
lactulose. 
- SBP: Trace ascites this hospitalization, but has had ascites 
and SBP before. She was continued on ciprofloxacin for SBP 
prophylaxis. 
- Ascites: Held diuretics in house in setting of intravascular 
depletion and ___. Restarted torsemide 20 mg daily at discharge. 

- Varices: EGD ___ with diffuse friability of stomach seen
with oozing, no intervenable lesions, no varices. Given CP B, 
she could benefit from primary prophylaxis with beta blocker; 
however, need for midodrine due to orthostatic hypotension 
prevents BB initiation. 
- Coagulopathy: elevated INR, received a trial of vitamin K with 
limited improvement in INR.
-Ca screening: cross sectional imaging with no concerning 
lesions
-Transplant w/u: per previous documentation, not a candidate due 
to comorbidities

# Anemia
# H/o UGIB

help decompress your bowels, with good effect
- Your JP drain fell out, and was replaced by ___
- Your kidneys suffered an injury, likely from the contrast used 
in your CT scan, so you were unable to urinate for a couple of 
days. Your kidney function improved, however, and is back to 
normal at discharge.

What should you do after you go home?
- Follow up with Dr. ___ on ___.
- Follow up with your PCP as scheduled.

IMAGING:
=======
CT CHEST W/O CONTRAST ___:
FINDINGS:  
  
No incidental thyroid findings.  No supraclavicular, 
infraclavicular or 
axillary lymphadenopathy.  There is a moderate interval decrease 
in size of the pre-existing mediastinal lymphadenopathy.  This 
is most obvious in 
para-aortic location (2, 15) As well as in right perihilar 
location (2, 18). There is stable enlargement of the main 
pulmonary artery, likely reflecting pulmonary hypertension.  
Stable appearance of the calcified coronary arteries. Stable 
appearance of the heart.  Moderate degenerative vertebral 
disease.  No vertebral compression fractures.  No osteolytic 
lesions at the level of the ribs, the sternum, or the vertebral 
bodies.  The pleural effusion on the right has almost completely 
resolved.  The small effusion on the left persists but the 
previous consolidation in the left lower lobe is improved as 
compared to the previous examination.  However, both the number 
and the size of pulmonary nodules, predominantly in the upper 
and middle zones of the lung, has substantially increased.  The 
relatively diffuse appearance of these changes as well as the 
upper lobe and middle lobe predominance favors infectious 
disease or inflammatory disease over malignancy.  The large 
airways are patent. 
  
IMPRESSION:  
  
The increase in number and size of pre-existing pulmonary 
nodules, 
predominating in the upper and middle lung zones.  The 
distribution and 
morphology of the nodules favors infection or inflammation over 
metastatic or malignant disease.  Interval decrease in size of 
the pre-existing mediastinal lymphadenopathy.  Near complete 
resolution of the previous right pleural effusion.  Mild 
decrease of the left lower lobe consolidation.

Brief Hospital Course:
___ is a ___ woman with PMHx EtOH cirrhosis (most 
recent MELDNa 20, ___ Class C) c/b ascites, SBP on ppx, 
HE, HRS on midodrine, s/p roux-en-Y gastric bypass c/b recurrent 
anastomotic c/b strictures requiring multiple endoscopic 
dilations, and multiple abdominal surgeries for bowel 
anastomosis complications (including bowel perforation) now on 
TPN for nutrition who presents as direct admission for 
initiation of G tube feeds. 

ACTIVE ISSUES:
============
#Initiation of Enteral Nutrition: 
The patient has a long history of difficulties tolerating 
enteral feeding and has been on TPN since ___. She was admitted 
from clinic to begin G-tube feedings. Encouragingly, prior to 
this admission, she had been tolerating small amounts of daily 
PO intake at home. The patient tolerated uptritration of tube 
feeds to goal rate of 80cc/hr without nausea or worsening 
abdominal pain. She was transitioned to cycled tube feeds prior 
to discharge. Since she was tolerating the tube feeds well, 
accompanied by small amounts of PO intake, TPN was discontinued 
prior to discharge, and her PICC line for TPN was removed. She 
will be discharged to have home tube feeds arranged and will be 
meeting with a ___ at her home to do this on the afternoon of 
discharge.

#Hyponatremia
The patient developed hyponatremia to 127 after initiation of 
G-tube feeds. Suspected hypovolemia in the setting of cessation 
of TPN. Her diuretics (torsemide/spironolactone) were held, and 
her sodium slowly improved. It was 129 on the afternoon of 
discharge. She will be discharged still holding her PO diuretics 
for the time being as she is still somewhat on the dry side, but 
she was encouraged to weigh herself daily and restart her 
diuretic if she notices her weight going up by more than ___ 
pounds. She should follow up next week to have labs drawn which 
can be faxed to Dr. ___ at ___ ___.

#Persistent LUQ fistula at J-tube site: 
J tube removed during an admission in ___. Per notes 
during each of her prior admissions, this had been an ongoing 
issue complicated by infections at the site which were 
potentially responsible for an episode of bacteremia w/in the 
last few months. The J tube site did not appear actively 
infected on this admission, but as it was still draining, wound 
care was consulted. They chemically cauterized the site with 
silver nitrate. No further issues during this admission. 

#EtOH Cirrhosis: MELD-Na on last labs
 1)Ascites: Holding diuretics due to above issues with 
hyponatremia. Instructed the patient to restart her diuretics at 
a lower dose when her weight goes up by ___ pounds.
- Start torsemide 80 mg daily when up ___ pounds
- Start spironolactone 100 mg daily when up ___ pounds 
 2)SBP: Hx of prior episodes but little concern for currently
-Continued cipro ppx
 3)Nutrition: As above
 4)Varices: Last EGD ___ w/o evidence of varices.
 5)HE: Episodes in the past but currently w/o confusion or 
asterixis. Continued on lactulose/rifaximin

CHRONIC ISSUES:
==============
#Chronic abdominal pain: In the past has seen palliative care 
for ongoing abdominal pain. Her pain was at baseline on this 
admission. She was continued on her home tramadol and Dilaudid.

#Depression/anxiety: She continued her home escitalopram 20 mg 
daily.

#H/o seizures: She continued her home Levetiracetam 1000mg PO 
BID.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,

It was a pleasure to participate in your care.

WHY WAS I ADMITTED TO THE HOSPITAL?
You were admitted directly from clinic in order to start tube 
feeds.

WHAT HAPPENED WHILE I WAS HERE?
You were started on tube feeds, and you tolerated them well - 
without worsening nausea or stomach pain.
Your sodium was a little low. We think this is probably because 
you were dehydrated from changing around your TPN and tube feeds 
and being on a high dose of diuretics.

WHAT SHOULD I DO WHEN I GET HOME?
Please continue to take your medications as instructed.
Please stick to a low salt diet.
Please go to all of your scheduled doctor's appointments.
You should weigh yourself every day. If you notice your weight 
going up by ___ pounds over the course of a couple of days, you 
should start taking your diuretics (torsemide 80 mg daily and 
spironolactone 100 mg daily). You should also follow up with 
your PCP and with Dr. ___ in ___ ___.

We wish you the best!
Sincerely,
Your ___ Liver Team

History of Present Illness:
Ms. ___ is a ___ y/o woman with PMH notable for ETOH cirrhosis 
c/b ascites/SBP/HE/?HRS (Child C), RXYGB c/b anastomotic 
stricture s/p multiple endoscopic dilations, recent discharged 
after complicated hospitalization for gastro-jejunal anastamotic 
perforation in setting of endoscopic GJ stricture dilation 
requiring urgent ex-lap, GJ take-down, and G-G anastomosis, 
presenting to ED with worsening jaundice and confusion.

Please refer to prior discharge summaries for detailed hospital 
course, but in brief, Ms. ___ was hospitalized between ___ 
and ___ during which time she underwent EGD with balloon 
dilation of known prior EJ anastamotic strictures c/b visceral 
perforation. She was urgently taken to the OR, where she had 
ex-lap, GJ takedown, and creation of new G-G. Her hospital 
course was further complicated by severe ileus requiring 
extensive decompression via NG tube while she was fed via 
percutaneous J-tube. She had multiple ICU stays, 
post-operatively as well as in the setting of possible infection 
vs. seizure. She was treated for secondary bacterial peritonitis 
as well as for lactobacillus bacteremia during this 
hospitalization as well. She was finally discharged after being 
advanced to combination of regular diet and tubefeeds.

She again presented to ___ between ___ and ___ for 
acute on chronic anemia. She underwent EGD showing friable 
gastric mucosa without any evidence of bleed. She was transfused 
supportively and her anemia was felt to be due to blunted marrow 
response in setting of malnutrition. Her course was complicated 
by severe nausea and vomiting ___ ileus (seen again on cross 
sectional imaging). She was initially decompressed with NG tube 
with good effect. After discussion between primary hepatology 
and transplant surgery team, she went for ___ venting 
G-tube placement on ___ in order to allow for decompression 
of her small G-G anastamotic pouch at home. Her nutrition was 
also optimized with assistance from transplant dietician and she 
was discharged home with instructions to follow-up closely as an 
outpatient.

Regarding this admission, according to the ED notes, her partner 
who accompanied her stated that she had worsening confusion and 
somnolence over the past 24 hours. She was reportedly having 
nonspecific pain all over but denying focal pain. One episode of 
emesis on the day of admission, normal BMs. No fevers. No falls 
or trauma.

In the ED, initial vitals were:
- 99.3 118 118/68 22 100% RA

PERTINENT IMAGING:
PORTABLE ABDOMEN XR (___):
No abnormally dilated loops of small or large bowel. Portable 
supine 
radiographs are limited for evaluation of free air, if there is 
ongoing clinical concern, consider left lateral decubitus, or 
upright radiographs or cross-sectional imaging. 

J-TUBE STUDY (___):
Appropriately positioned jejunostomy tube.  No signs of leak or 
obstruction.

EEG (___):
This is an abnormal continuous ICU monitoring study because of
(1) frequent generalized epileptiform discharges, which rarely 
occur in very
brief periodic runs at up to 3 Hz and lasts for 1 second at a 
time, indicative
of diffusely increased cortical irritability. These discharges 
become
significantly less frequent after midnight, likely corresponding 
to
administration of levetiracetam; (2) a slow and disorganized 
background with
abundant generalized broad-based sharp waves with triphasic 
morphology and A-P
phase lag, indicative of a moderate encephalopathy, which is 
nonspecific as to
etiology, but most likely toxic-metabolic in nature. The 
background also
gradually improves over the course of the recording. There are 
no pushbutton
activations. There are no electrographic seizures.

PA and LATERAL CXR (___):
Moderate left pleural effusion has increased, including a 
fissural component. 
  
Consolidation superior to the right major fissure that developed 
on ___, probably upper lobe pneumonia, particularly due to 
aspiration.  Heart size is normal.  There is no pulmonary edema, 
right pleural effusion, or evidence of pneumothorax. 

ABDOMEN SUPINE AND ERECT (___):
Nonspecific, nonobstructive bowel gas pattern however there are 
a few 
scattered air-fluid levels noted within the left upper abdomen.

encephalopathy, ascites, SBP, and HRS), complex surgical anatomy 
(RxYGB c/b recurrent anastamotic strictures requiring multiple 
endoscopic dilations, recently complicated by anastamotic 
perforation requiring ex-lap, GJ take-down, and creation of new 
G-G), and recent placement of venting G-tube due to persistent 
nausea and vomiting who was brought to the Emergency Department 
due to altered mental status. 

Found to not be draining G-tube properly and had not taken some 
of her home doses of lactulose; in addition her home 
levetiracetam had been held after her last discharge to promote 
improved gastric motility. Pt was started back on her 
levetiracetam, had her G tube properly drained, and was 
administered lactulose - to improvement of her mental status. 
She was educated on how to vent her G-tube continuously to 
promote gastric decompression and improve her nausea/vomiting. 
She had a mild aspiration pneumonitis after an episode of 
vomiting, with one fever, covered with 48hrs of ceftazidime and 
metronidazole. Pt had a mild acute-on-chronic episode of anemia 
(thought to be combination of nutritional on top of friable 
gastric/anastomotic mucosa in setting of complex surgical 
anatomy), requiring 1uPRBC; she did not have other evidence of 
active blood loss. 

She was discharged on a pureed diet with instructions to take 
small meals. Dronabinol was added for symptomatic management of 
her nausea, to some improvement of her nausea/vomiting. 

For volume management, her furosemide was increased and 
spironolactone was started. 

DETAILED HOSPITAL COURSE
ACTIVE ISSUES:
# ENCEPHALOPATHY: 
With a combination of repetitive movements and 
nonresponsiveness, concerning for hepatic encephalopathy vs. 
seizures. EEG demonstrated similar epileptiform discharges at 
high risk for seizure, but no frank seizure activity. 
Encephalopathy thought to be d/t these waveforms in the setting 
of discontinuing levetiracetam at previous hospital stay and not 
being able to drain her G-tube independently at home, as well as 
forgetting to take doses of lactulose causing confusion. Pt's 
mental status cleared with HE treatment (lactulose, rifaximin), 
resumption of levetiracetam, and draining of G-tube. Pt A&O x3 
at discharge.

# S/P VENTING G-TUBE PLACEMENT
# NAUSEA AND VOMITING:
Pt and boyfriend educated on her G-tube drainage, given that she 
had come in with inability to drain her tube at home. Still has 
intermittent N/V regardless of G-tube drainage. Pt's 
nausea/vomiting was improved with a combination of scheduled 
G-tube flushes to avoid clogging, giving small pureed meals, and 
keeping the G-tube venting continuously. Dronabinol also added 
to medication regimen to improve nausea. Lactulose was decreased 
d/t persistent nausea and cramping.

# FEVER: 
Likely due to an episode of aspiration pneumonitis in the 
setting of frequent vomiting. Pt afebrile after 48hrs on 
ceftazidime/metronidazole, and without a white count or 
respiratory symptoms; antibiotics discontinued after this time.

# ACUTE-ON-CHRONIC ANEMIA: 
Previous EGD in ___ without any sources of active bleed, 
though Pt noted to have friable mucosa at anastomotic sites. 
Likely due to some amount of oozing from her gastropathy on top 
of poor nutritional baseline. She was given 1uPRBC during this 
hospital stay. Maintained on pantoprazole in-house, transitioned 
to esomeprazole liquid at discharge.

# HYPONATREMIA with
# HYPERVOLEMIA: 
Likely due to poor PO intake + hypervolemia given significant 
lower extremity edema. Symptomatically improved leg swelling 
after active diuresis with IV furosemide, but with downtrending 
sodium. Sodium was improved after 50g albumin and improved PO 
intake.

CHRONIC/STABLE ISSUES:
# ETOH cirrhosis: 
Child C with MELD on admission 25 from 21 at recent discharge, 
now sober since ___ with complications of cirrhosis 
including ascites, HE, SBP, and possible signs of portal 
gastropathy. Her encephalopathy presently improved, with no 
asterixis. Had minimal ascites with overall fluid overload on 
now-increased diuretic regimen.
- spironolactone 25mg PO daily, furosemide 40mg PO daily
- Bactrim daily for SBP PPx.
- Midodrine 5mg TID, can consider downtitrating as outpatient

# H/O perforated anastamotic stricture I/s/o RxY requiring 
recent ex-lap with GG re-anastomatosis: With recent extensive 
hospital course with significant ileus, treated supportively. 
She is ___ months removed from surgery and overall doing well from 
an operative standpoint. She also had venting G-tube placed 4 
days prior to the current admission, which has been source of 
intermittent problems w/r/t venting.
- Regular diet as tolerated, encouraged Pt to start with small 
amounts of pureed food.
- Continued tube feeds through J tube
- Zofran PRN nausea, dronabinol added to regimen
- Lactulose as above
- management of G-tube as above

# H/O ETOH Abuse: Serum EtOH negative on admission
- continued MVI, thiamine, folate

# Depression/Anxiety: continued home escitalopram

# H/O epileptiform discharges: 
- continued home levetiracetam

# Insomnia: 
- hold mirtazepine in the setting of AMS

Brief Hospital Course:
PATIENT SUMMARY:
================
This a ___ year-old woman with a PMH of decompensated alcoholic 
cirrhosis (SBP, ascites, HE), non-variceal UGIB, s/p RNYGB, 
prior J-tube, current G-tube for enteral feedings, abdominal 
wall abscess and EC fistula at prior J-tube insertion site, 
recurrent ileus/SBO, and recent admission (___) for 
abdominal pain
who presented with weight gain and weakness, found to have acute 
on chronic anemia. Diuresed with IV Lasix gtt to dry weight.

ACUTE ISSUES:
=============
# Volume Overload
# Weight Gain
Patient with reported 10 pound weight gain prior to admission. 
She had been inconsistent diuretic dose, with torsemide 
increased to 60 mg daily immediately prior to her admission. CT 
abdomen performed in the ED on this admission revealed chronic 
partial small bowel obstruction with improved small bowel 
distention compared to prior CT. Minimal ascites on CT and none 
on ultrasound. TTE from ___ showed borderline mild LV cavity 
dilation with normal LV function, borderline hyperdynamic. 
Etiology of fluid overload likely multifactorial in the setting 
of hypoalbuminemia and known cirrhosis. Patient was diuresed 
with IV Lasix drip at 15 mg/hour then transitioned to oral 
regimen of torsemide 60 mg daily. Discharge weight: 224.2 pounds 
down from 238.91 on admission. 

# Acute on Chronic Macrocytic Anemia
# Weakness
Hgb nadir 6.5 on admission. Anemia is chronic and baseline is in 
the mid 7s typically. Macrocytic, likely related to prior 
history of RNYGB. Vitamin B12 and folate both WNL this 
admission. She received 1 U pRBC transfusion and required no 
further blood transfusions. Weakness improved with diuresis. Hgb 
7.9 on day of discharge. 

# Nutrition
# Tube Feeds
Chronic tube feeding dependence via G-tube. Continued home TF 
regimen of Osmolite 1.5 @ 80 mL/hr x 12 hours, flush 50 mL q6h.

# EtOH Cirrhosis
# Coagulopathy
# Thrombocytopenia 
Previously complicated by hepatic encephalopathy, SBP, and 
ascites. Followed by Dr. ___ B cirrhosis. MELD 17 
on admission. No evidence of ascites on imaging. Patient was 
continued on lactulose, rifaximin, ciprofloxacin, and midodrine. 
Platelets stable at 85 on discharge. INR 1.6 on discharge, which 
is her baseline. 

CHRONIC ISSUES:
===============
# Abdominal Pain/Distention
Continued home tramadol 50 mg PO BID and hydropmorphone 2 mg 
daily though monitored mental status closely. No HE this 
admission though patient was somnolent at times. Continues 
metoclopramide and simethicone as well. 

# Epileptiform seizures
Continued home Keppra 1000 mg PO BID.

# GERD
Continued home omeprazole 40 mg daily.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
====================
# Patient noted to have some purulence at G tube insertion site. 
Evaluated by transplant surgery who felt that everything looked 
stable and some purulence is to be expected. Please continue to 
monitor in outpatient setting.

# Patient transitioned to oral torsemide 60 mg daily upon 
discharge. Patient may require further uptitration of oral 
torsemide in the outpatient setting. 

# TTE this admission: Compared with the prior TTE of (images 
reviewed) of ___, there is now biventricular cavity 
enlargement. 

NEW MEDICATIONS:
- Multivitamins W/minerals 1 TAB PO/NG DAILY 

CHANGED MEDICATIONS:

IMAGING/REPORTS
============================================
CXR ___
IMPRESSION:    
Although no definite focal consolidation is seen, elevation of 
the left 
hemidiaphragm posteriorly obscures the left lung base on the 
lateral view. 
  

TTE ___
The left atrial volume index is moderately increased. No atrial 
septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. The estimated 
right atrial pressure is ___ mmHg. Left ventricular wall 
thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity is mildly 
dilated. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal 
(LVEF>55%). Quantitative (3D) LVEF = 71%. The estimated cardiac 
index is high (>4.0L/min/m2). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests a 
normal left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg). Doppler 
parameters are most consistent with normal left ventricular 
diastolic function. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear 
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic 
stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve 
leaflets are structurally normal. Trivial mitral regurgitation 
is seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic 
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion. 

IMPRESSION: Borderline mild LV cavity dilation with normal LV 
function, borderline hyperdynamic. High cardiac index. Trivial 
mitral regurgitation. Moderate pulmonary hypertension. 
Borderline elevated Aortic and pulmonic velocities most likely 
due to high cardiac output. 

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of ___ LV 
function appears slightly more vigorous. Severity of TR is 
decreased and RV does not appear dilated on today's study. RAP 
lower on today's study. Cardiac output higher on today's study.  


LIVER US ___
IMPRESSION:  
Cirrhotic morphology of the liver, with sequelae of portal 
hypertension, 
including ascites and splenomegaly. 

SOFT TISSUE ULTRASOUND ___
IMPRESSION:  
A fluid filled tract is seen between the site of the prior 
J-tube and the 
abdominal wall abscess, however, recommend fistulogram to 
further evaluate the tract and evaluate for any intraperitoneal 
communication. 
RECOMMENDATION(S):  Recommend fistulogram for further 
evaluation. 

CT ABD & PELVIS W/O CONTRAST ___:
IMPRESSION: 
1. Skin thickening at the site of prior jejunostomy.  No 
liquified fluid 
collection identified in this location. 
2. Increased soft tissue deep to the previous jejunostomy site 
located in the vicinity of matted loops of small bowel, without 
oral contrast reaching this location, it is unclear if there is 
an enterocutaneous fistula or if soft tissue findings just 
represent inflammatory tissue or hematoma.  Consider repeat 
delayed imaging once oral contrast has traversed this location 
to evaluate for underlying fistula. 
3. Dilated small bowel loops increased in severity compared to 
recent prior CT scans without transition point, findings favor 
ileus. 
4. Diffuse anasarca. 
5. Cirrhosis with sequela of portal hypertension. 

UNILAT LOWER EXT VEINS LEFT ___
IMPRESSION:

Brief Hospital Course:
BRIEF SUMMARY
=============
___ w/ EtOH cirrhosis (h/o SBP, ascites, HE), s/p RNYGB (w/ 
multiple complications, prior J-tube, current G-tube for enteral 
feedings) transferred w/ abdominal pain and drainage from 
J-tube, found to have an abdominal wall abscess, for which she 
underwent I&D x3, s/p CTX/Flagyl), with hospital course 
complicated by ___ and hyponatremia (which both improved with 
colloid challenge), severe diuretic-resistant anasarca, and 
intermittent hepatic encephalopathy.

# Abdominal wall abscess
# Enterocutaneous fistula
Patient presented with abdominal wall pain and erythema and 
drainage from former J-tube site.  Imaging notable for small 
3x1x1cm superficial abscess the left lateral anterior abdominal 
wall lateral to the old J-tube site.  Underwent I&D on 
presentation and initially started on doxycycline and augmentin, 
and then transitioned to ceftriaxone and doxycycline.  She 
developed worsening pain at the site several days later and 
underwent repeat I&D. Cultures of draining fluid from ___ with 
mixed flora. She was transitioned from CTX/doxy to 
CTX/metronidazole. Fistulogram demonstrated enterocutaneous 
fistula involving abscess cavity, former J-tube site, and a loop 
of bowel. Given that the fistula would likely heal itself over 
time and that the wound would continue to drain allowing source 
control, antibiotics were stopped when the abscess no longer 
looked cellulitic/infected (about 10 days after last I&D). The 
wound would not heal, became more erythematous, and had 
persistent yellow drainage so the patient was taken to the OR on 
___ for drainage of intraperitoneal abscess and JP drain 
placement into the prior J tube site with the plan to send her 
home with her drain in place to be emptied daily along with 
twice daily wound care via ___ and follow up with Dr. ___ in 
his transplant surgery office.

#Acute kidney injury
On admission, the patient was found to have acute kidney injury 
on presentation with creatinine peak of 3 (from baseline Cr 1).  
Thought to be secondary to recent diuretic use in the setting of 
infection leading to pre-renal azotemia, and possibly also 
contrast injury.  She continued home midodrine. She improved 
back to baseline with colloid challenge and volume 
resuscitation. Her kidney function began to decline again when 
diuretics started to treat her anasarca, but improved again with 
colloid. After kidney function returned again to baseline, we 
were able to give 120 mg BID torsemide without albumin with no 
decline in kidney function. Throughout hospitalization, 
intermittently had hyperkalemia with EKG changes. Her creatinine 
was at baseline and stable at discharge.

#Cirrhosis c/b hepatic encephalopathy, ascites, spontaneous 
bacterial peritonitis
The patient has a history of cirrhosis complicated by 
diuretic-resistant anasarca and hepatic encephalopathy. During 
admission, oral ciprofloxacin was held while on high dose 
ceftriaxone and restarted when ceftriaxone was discontinued. She 
continued on home lactulose and rifaximin.  We held home 
diuretics given her hyponatremia and ___ but restarted torsemide 
prior to discharge. We were unable to restart spironolactone as 
re-starting could cause hyperkalemia. Continued on multivitamin, 
thiamine, folic acid. Continued on home midodrine. The plan at 
discharge was to continue BID diuretics at home given volume 
overload during admission. She will have follow up with Dr. ___ 
___ Dr. ___.

#Acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding
The patient also had acute on chronic anemia and Initially 
received 2U PRBCs to help with colloid resuscitation. HGB later 
downtrended, requiring 1U PRBCs. EGD demonstrated slow upper GI 
bleed due to friability of stomach/slow oozing. She was given 
vitamin K and high dose PPI with subsequent stabilization of 
H&H.

Transitional Issues:
[] For wound care- 
Twice daily
AM- Remove and gently replace packing in wound, wet-to-dry 
gently into cavity and fresh drain sponge
___- wet-to-dry gently into cavity and fresh drain sponge
Abdominal drain-
-Drain Upkeep:
 Drain and record the JP drain output twice daily and as needed 
so that the drain is never more than ½ full. Ensure that the 
bulb is compressed so that the vacuum is maintained. Call the 
office if the drain output increases by more than 100 
milliliters from the previous day, turns greenish in color, 
becomes bloody or develops a foul odor.
 Change the drain dressing once daily or after your shower. Do 
not allow the drain to hang freely at any time. Inspect the site 
for redness, drainage or bleeding. Make sure there is a stitch 
at the drain site.
[]Patient's spironolactone was held given hyperkalemia, and will 
need to be resumed in the outpatient setting
[]The patient will need weekly laboratory draw as below:
Chemistry 10 panel 
Please fax results to- ATTN Dr. ___: ___
[] The patient is being discharged on 120mg of torsemide twice 
daily so that she can continue diuresis at home. Her labs were 
stable in the hospital for over 7 days on this regimen without 
change in her creatinine or sodium
[] Patient should continue cycled home tube feeds present on 
admission

History of Present Illness:
Ms. ___ is a ___ y/o woman with PMH notable for ETOH cirrhosis 
c/b ascites/SBP/HE/?HRS (Child C), RXYGB c/b anastomotic 
stricture s/p multiple endoscopic dilations, recent discharged 
after complicated hospitalization for gastro-jejunal anastamotic 
perforation in setting of endoscopic GJ stricture dilation 
requiring urgent ex-lap, GJ take-down, and G-G anastomosis, 
presenting from clinic with worsening asymptomatic anemia.

Regarding the patient's recent admission between ___ - 
___, she initially presented with recurrent N/V and fevers 
reportedly up to 101.4F. She was felt to be symptomatic from a 
recurrent GJ anastomotic stricture and underwent EGD on ___ 
with successful balloon dilation of this stricture. Following 
the procedure, she developed acute onset worsening abdominal 
pain and distension and was diagnosed with perforated 
gastrojejunostomy. For this, she was taken to the OR and 
underwent exploratory laparotomy, takedown old 
gastrojejunostomy, and creation of a gastrogastrostomy (on 
___. Unfortunately, following this first operation, it was 
remembered that a remaining hole in the patient's stomach was 
not closed and she was re-intubated and underwent repeat 
laparotomy with closure of the gastrostomy site. Given 
post-operative N/V and inability to take PO's, she was taken to 
the first of 2 ICU for further management.

With regards to her GI system, she suffered from severely 
refractory N/V and PO intolerance post-operatively. She was 
initially started on TF via NG with minimal success. She had UGI 
series showing severely slowed transit through the small bowel 
and multiple serial CT scans of the abdomen showing no signs of 
complete obstruction but dilated loops of small bowel on 
multiple occasions. During this diagnostic process, she was 
found to have malpositioned surgical J-tube (successfully 
replaced on ___. She also had work-up with EGD with small 
bowel push enteroscopy showing erythema and congestion of 
stomach and normal small bowel enteroscopy to jejunum to 100cm 
(___). For pro-motility, she was tried on octreotide (with 
little effect) and erythromycin (with good effect on motility 
but severe adverse effect of worsening N/V). Her ileus worsened 
upon second transfer to the ICU, with worsening mental status 
(as detailed below), but with supportive care, she ultimately 
improved to the point where she was tolerating TF at goal. She 
was subsequently advanced to a regular diet, which she was 
tolerating on discharge in addition to TF through a percutaneous 
GJ.

During this course, the patient also had an extensive infectious 
course. She was treated broadly with a combination of Zosyn 
(intermittently switched to Ceftriaxone/Flagyl) as well as 
Daptomycin for what was felt to be polymicrobial peritonitis 
given her visceral perforation. she was also treated with 
Fluconazole for sparse growth of ___ albicans from her 
peritoneal fluid. Following treatment with this broad regimen of 
antibiotics/antifungals, she was transitioned to cipro for SBP 
ppx on ___ (subsequently changed to Bactrim given seizure 
risk with fluoroquinolones). She was again febrile to 102.3F, 
however, with positive growth of pediococcus (lactobacillus 
species) on ___. This was of unclear significant, but given 
her underlying cirrhosis and risk for GI translocation, she was 
started on short course of linezolid (completed ___ prior to 
discharge) with no more sx.

Her other problems during the hospitalization included 
hypotension, amidst sedating/pain medications and fluid shifts. 
For this, she intermittently required levophed in the ICU for 
blood pressure support and was eventually initiated on midodrine 
therapy with improvements in her hemodynamics on discharge dose 
of 5mg PO TID.

The midodrine also doubled as treatment for ?HRS, which she 
developed during this hospitalization. Her Cr peaked at 6.3 on 
___, and her diuretics were held briefly before being restarted 
gently prior to discharge (lasix 20mg PO daily with 
spironolactone continued to be held I/s/o hyponatremia). 
Discharge Cr was 0.6. 

She also had a pleural effusion treated with throcentesis and 
indwelling pigtail drainage catheter (placed ___ - removed 
___ with significant improvements in her respiratory systems. 
___, she was also intubated multiple times and had 
some compressive atelectasis treated with supportive care.

She also had epileptiform discharges and alterations in mental 
status during this admission (on ___ requiring ICU transfer, 
felt to be due to a combination of hepatic encephalopathy 
treated with lactulose effectively, as well as possible 
seizure-like activity. She was diagnosed with epileptiform 
discharged on EEG, which were infrequent but concerning enough 
to warrant initiation of Keppra therapy per neurology 
consultation.

Lastly, she was found to have a breast mass on exam, for which 
GYN was consulted. They recommended mammography on ___, which 
revealed 2 indeterminate masses in the right breast, BIRADS 4B. 
She underwent U/S guided core biopsy on ___, with subsequent 
pathology showing fibroadipose tissue with blood, fibrin, and 
predominantly acute inflammatory cell infiltrate, karyorrhectic 
debris, and scattered calcifications. Per ___ (breast surgery 
service), there was no indication for further surgery and she 
was discharged with follow-up with Breast clinic.

With regards to her cirrhosis, she did begin some of her 
transplant work-up with TTE performed (EF 60-65%) and slightly 
elevated PASP of 27mmHg. Work-up was otherwise deferred in the 
setting of acute illness.

Since discharge, she has actually been doing ok. She was not 
eating very well but has not been nauseated or vomited since 2 
days post-discharge. She is tolerating mostly liquid diet and 
cold water. She presented for routine follow-up in transplant 
clinic on ___, where routine labs were notable for Hgb of 
6.2 (compared to discharge hgb of 7.6). She did not have any sx 
of LH, fatigue (beyond baseline), chest pain/pressure (beyond 
baseline chest tightness which has been unchanged since before 
her surgeries), or SOB. She denies any black stool, bloody 
stool, N/V/hematemesis, epistaxis, or hematuria. She has not 
been sleeping very well at home, but is starting to get better 
and was just prescribed something for this by her doctor today 
___ per ___.

Otherwise, ROS unremarkable for no fevers, chills, or worsening 
jaundice. Her lower extremities are more edematous than before, 
but her abdomen feels less distended. She is only taking Tylenol 
for pain control at home.

encephalopathy, SBP, and HRS), as well as complicated gastric 
surgical anatomy (Roux-en-Y gastric bypass complicated by 
recurrent anastamotic strictures requiring multiple endoscopic 
dilations, recently complicated by anastamotic perforation 
requiring ex-lap, GJ take-down, and creation of new G-G) who was 
discharged from the hospital on ___. She presented due to 
acute-on-chronic anemia found in the outpatient setting (Hb 6.2 
on ___, down from 7.6 at prior discharge on ___, concerning 
for possible postoperative/marginal ulcer bleed. Pt had no 
symptoms from her anemia. She was given 1uPRBC, to stability of 
her Hb. Course complicated by nausea/vomiting, requiring NGT 
decompression; small-bowel ileus was identified on CT A/P on 
arrival. Pt previously had noted delayed GI tract motility; she 
had tried erythromycin adn octreotide, to no promotility 
improvement. Transplant Surgery followed this patient. They 
recommended placement of a venting G-tube placement so that Pt 
could decompress her stomach at home to relieve her N/V. Pt 
underwent venting G-tube placement on ___ with ___. She was able 
to manage her tube and tolerate PO at discharge.

ACTIVE ISSUES:
# ACUTE-ON-CHRONIC ANEMIA: Reticulocyte count 0.01 on arrival, 
concerning for hypoproliferative etiology on top of some 
acute-on-chronic loss. With stable Hb after 1uPRBC transfusion. 
EGD on ___ did not demonstrate any bleeding marginal ulcers; 
it was notable for portal gastropathy, as well as mild 
friability of mucosa around her surgical anastomosis sites. Her 
anemia likely due to a combination of oozing from anastomotic 
sites/portal gastropathy vs. moderate malnutrition. Stools were 
guaiac negative. She was discharged home with nutrition 
supplementation as below.

# NAUSEA/VOMITING: Pt with an episode of feculent emesis on 
___, and CT A/P demonstrating small bowel ileus. Pt endorsed 
significant relief with placement of NGT. As Pt has had previous 
dysmotility noted (tried erythromycin and octreotide, to little 
promotile improvement), she underwent placement of a venting 
G-tube per discussion with Transplant Surgery. The purpose of 
this tube will be to allow Pt to self-decompress her stomach 
when she feels nauseous at home, so she does not require 
recurrent NGT placement or present with recurrent 
nausea/vomiting. She underwent placement of venting G-tube on 
___, and was able to manage her tube at discharge. Her 
nausea and vomiting as improved with this tube, as well as 
recommendation to take small meals frequently ___ small meals 
per day). 

# MALNUTRITION, MODERATE with
# HYPONATREMIA and
# COAGULOPATHY: 
With hyponatremia on arrival (nadir 125), as well as low 
zinc/copper levels and low albumin (to nadir 2.2) concerning for 
moderate malnutrition. Hyponatremia likely due to poor PO intake 
at home in setting of chronic illness as well as decreased 
gastric motility and ileus. Coagulopathy (INR > 2) likely due to 
poor nutrition as well. Pt was able to use her regular tube 
feeds and manage nausea with venting G-tube as above. 

CHRONIC/STABLE ISSUES:
# ETOH CIRRHOSIS: Child's class C, sober since ___. 
Complicated by ascites, HE, SBP. 
- Continued home lactulose, SBP PPx with Bactrim, and midodrine.
- Held home diuretics I/s/o concern for GI bleed, resumed at 
discharge

# H/O PERFORATED ANASTOMIC STRICTURE I/S/O ROUX-EN-Y: 
With complicated anatomic history, and recent hospitalization 
requiring exploratory laparotomy with creation of new G-G 
re-anastomosis. Surgical history likely contributes to her 
delayed gastrointestinal motility. Venting G-tube placement as 
above, with tube feeds as previously prescribed.

# H/O ETOH ABUSE: As above
- MVI, thiamine, folate

# DEPRESSION/ANXIETY: 
- Home escitalopram

# H/O EPILEPTIFORM DISCHARGES:
Previously noted during her most recent hospital stay, without 
any frank epileptiform activity. Levetiracetam discontinued on 
___ to promote improved GI motility. Pt without any altered 
mental status or confusion concerning for seizures during the 
current stay. 

# INSOMNIA: 
- Continued mirtazapine

Discharge Instructions:
Dear ___,

___ was a pleasure to care for you at the ___ 
___.  You were seen in our hospital because you had 
lab work which showed a low blood count.  We gave you a blood 
transfusion to help with this.  While in the hospital, you also 
had nausea and vomiting.  We believe this is due to your stomach 
and intestines moving food more slowly than usual.  For this 
reason, our Interventional Radiology team placed a special tube 
(a "venting G-tube") to help relieve some of the pressure from 
your stomach.  This should help improve your nausea and 
vomiting.  

We wish you the best,
Your ___ Care Team

Brief Hospital Course:
___ w/ EtOH cirrhosis (c/b SBP, ascites, HE), non-variceal UGIB, 
s/p RNYGB, current G-tube for enteral feedings, recently 
hospitalized with an abdominal wall abscess and EC fistula at 
her prior J-tube insertion site with a current drain tube who is 
presented with abdominal pain, nausea and emesis likely due to 
recurrent ileus or SBO, complicated by ATN and encephalopathy. 
Discharge delayed by recurrent clogging of G tube, replaced by 
___ on ___. 

#) Intermittent SBO
Pain and nausea have been intermittent throughout 
hospitalization. Ileus may be contributing given imaging notable 
for multiple dilated fluid-filled small bowel loops; no 
transition point or decompressed loops identified to suggest 
partial bowel obstruction although it may be spontaneously 
resolving and returning. Low suspicion for SBP on presentation 
given already on ciprofloxacin prophylaxis, lack of 
leukocytosis, and afebrile. No tapable pocket on admission. 
Transplant surgery felt unlikely related to enterocutaneous 
fistulas. Most likely diagnosis at is intermittent SBO. Severe 
pain initially managed with dilaudid, zofran but developed 
encephalopathy and NG tube was placed to suction with 
improvement in pain, N/V and encephalopathy. Pain managed well 
on tylenol once BMs returned, and NG was discontinued. Educated 
patient on reducing dilaudid use at home to prevent 
constipation. Added simethicone to reduce bloating. 

# G tube malfunction
Patient had intermittent G-tube clogging throughout 
hospitalization, which was associated with abdominal pain, 
nausea, and vomiting. On ___, she had her G-tube replaced by 
___, with improvement in her abdominal symptoms. Prior to 
discharge, she was tolerating tube feeds through the G-tube 
without significant abdominal symptoms.

#) ATN
Patient recently had kidney injury during prior hospitalization 
in the setting of contrast-induced nephropathy and hypovolemia. 
She presented with Cr 1.4 (from ___ ~0.8), up to 4.8 with 
associated hyperkalemia, hyperphosphatemia, hyponatremia. Renal 
was consulted, felt the etiology was likely ATN due to contrast 
induced nephropathy. He received insulin/dextrose/calcium for 
hyperkalemia x 2, before kidney function improved. Discharge Cr 
was 1.0.

#) Encephalopathy
Encephalopathy during this hospitalization likely due to 
decreased bowel movements i/s/o probable partial vs full SBO, 
with contribution of acute renal failure as well (now resolved). 
Much improved with regular BMs (lactulose NG and enemas) and 
improvement in renal function.

#) Thrombocytopenia
Downtrending from admission ~100 to a low of 52, on discharge up 
to 70. Chronic, due to cirrhosis.

# Anemia # H/o UGIB
Chronic anemia and hemoglobin between ___. Hgb dipped and 
received 2u pRBC ___, stable since.

#) Asymptomatic bacteriuria: 
Urine culture grew enterococcus, likely contamination due to 
bowel regiment. Patient asymptomatic and was not treated. 

#) ETOH CIRRHOSIS
Followed by Dr. ___. Last drink ___. CP B-C. MELD-Na 23 on 
admission. 
- HE: lactulose and rifaximin through PEG
- SBP: cont home ciprofloxacin
- Ascites: torsemide (held during bp dips) 
- Varices: EGD ___ with diffuse friability of stomach seen 
with oozing, no intervenable lesions, no varices. 
- Coagulopathy: secondary to cirrhosis, received a trial of 
vitamin K during recent hospitalization with only limited 
improvement in INR
- Transplant w/u: per previous documentation, not a candidate 
due to comorbidities

STUDIES:
=====================================
EGD ___:
Findings: 
Esophagus:  
Mucosa: Distal esophageal erosions consistent with esophagitis 
were seen at the gastroesophageal junction. This was classified 
at Grade A by ___.  
Stomach:  
Lumen: A stricture was seen at the site of Gastro-Jejunal 
anastomosis. The scope could not be advanced. A 10-12mm CRE 
balloon was used to dilate the stricture up to 12mm. After 
balloon dilation the decision was made to place a NJT to help 
with feeding. A NJT was successfully placed across the 
anastomotic stricture.   
Contents: Small amount of digested food was found in the stomach 
pouch.  
Duodenum: Normal duodenum. 

Impression:
•Distal esophageal erosions consistent with esophagitis were 
seen at the gastroesophageal junction. This was classified at 
Grade A by ___.
•A stricture was seen at the site of Gastro-Jejunal anastomosis. 
The scope could not be advanced. A 10-12mm CRE balloon was used 
to dilate the stricture up to 12mm.
•After balloon dilation the decision was made to place a NJT to 
help with feeding. A NJT was successfully placed across the 
anastomotic stricture.

Recommendations: 
•Start enteral nutrition using NJT.
•Follow-up with referring physicians as previously scheduled.
•If any chest or abdominal pain, fevers, bleeding, difficulty 
swallowing, nausea, vomiting or any other concerning post 
procedure symptom, please call the advanced endoscopy fellow on 
call ___ ___.
•Repeat EGD in ___.
 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ w/ EtOH cirrhosis (c/b HE, ascites, SBP), s/p gastric bypass 
who was initially admitted to ___ with 
nausea/vomiting/abdominal pain where she was treated for SBP 
with CTX, developed HRS started on midodrine/octreotide and 
treated for multifocal pneumonia. She was transferred to ___ 
for management of dysphagia ___ esophageal stricture given 
technically difficult dilation and patient coagulopathic.

At ___, the patient reported a chronic stricture developed 
after RYGB ___ years ago) w/ daily emesis and difficulty with 
solids>liquids. The patient underwent EGD on ___ w/ balloon 
dilation and NG tube placement (FFP administered prior to 
dilation). Tube feeds were initiated and well tolerated by 
patient. Patient was discharged on TF, and is to follow up as 
outpatient for further dilation/stent placement.

Hospital course was complicated by decompensated cirrhosis 
(ascites). Patient underwent diagnostic/therapeutic paracentesis 
on ___ by ___ and had 4L removed. No e/o SBP but she was started 
on ciprofloxacin prophylaxis given report of SBP at ___. The 
patient's HRS at ___ had improved by the time of admission to 
___, with admission Cr of 1.1. Her midodrine was uptitrated to 
15mg TID given persistently low blood pressures, octreotide was 
stopped. MELD on discharge: 20

Of note, patient inquired about transplant work up. Social work 
was consulted and initiated discussion regarding transplant work 
up and requirement of abstinence. Patient's reported last drink: 
___. Our liver transplant team will contact the patient 
for further evaluation.

Transitional Issues:
==============================

possible HRS. If her Cr is stable on follow up with her 
gastroenterologist, they can be resumed with close monitoring.
-Patient must abstain from ETOH to be considered for liver 
transplant in the future.
-Patient w/ concern for HRS, started on midodrine 15mg TID with 
normalization of Cr. She should follow up with outpatient 
gastroenterologist for further titration/discontinuation. Cr on 
discharge 0.9.
-Outpatient follow up to be arranged with ___ GI (Dr. ___ 
___ for potential repeat scoping with stent placement.
-___ Liver ___ to follow up with the patient for 
further evaluation.
-Patient was set up with tube feeds via NGT. She will need 
repeat nutrition evaluation as an outpatient, which will likely 
occur BEFORE she establishes care with a ___ Hepatologist. Her

TRANSTIONAL ISSUES 
====================
# DISCHARGE WEIGHT: 102.33 kg (225.6 lb)  
# DISCHARGE Cr: 0.8
# CODE STATUS: Full (presumed) 
# CONTACT INFO: 
-Name of health care proxy: ___ 
-Relationship: Mother, Father 
-Phone number: ___ 
-Cell phone: ___ 

# Partial small bowel obstruction
# Chronic constipation 
[] If patient has symptoms of SBO, please do not initiate 
surgical intervention unless absolutely indicated! Patient is 
high risk given her complicated surgical history (frozen 
abdomen) and liver cirrhosis. 
[] CONSIDER RESTARTING LINACLOTIDE for IBS w/ constipation
[] If develops similar symptoms - 1) advise lactulose enema to 
decompress bowel and 2) monitor via serial KUBs with 
gastrografin

# Right Hydronephrosis, mild:
[] Repeat renal U/S by end of ___ to evaluate for 
persistent/progressive hydronpehrosis
[] Consider urology follow up pending above study

# Chronic enterocutaneous fistula
[] Recommend U/S if swollen/painful to r/o abscess; may require 
prophylactic antibiotics if recurrent infection 
[] If uncontrolled bleeding consider referral to interventional 
radiology for embolization.

# Chronic abdominal pain:
[] Continue to wean off Hydromorphone (2mg q12h:PRN) and 
Tramadol (50mg BID:PRN) as these medications are likely 
contributing to slow gut motility and recurrent partial 
obstructions. 
 
# Alcoholic Cirrhosis 
[] Encourage relapse prevention, therapy
[] Due for an EGD later this month
[] Q6 month AFP (normal ___ 
[] Received Hep B and A vaccine first dose on ___
   [] Second dose of Hep B is due on ___
   [] Third dose of Hep B is due on ___
   [] Second dose of Hep A is due on ___   
[] Should receive pneumovax

# Gynecology:
[] Please remove Mirena, as it has been present for ___ years

ACTIVE ISSUES:
# Enterococcus Bacteremia (resolved):
Patient presented with acute on chronic abdominal pain. Blood 
cultures from ___ were positive for Enterococcus that is 
sensitive to ampicillin ___
bottles). TTE was without evidence of endocarditis. Patient was 
treated with Ampicillin for 14 days. Likely source of infection 
is enterocutaneous fistula. Blood cultures from the ___ did 
not show growth. 

# Enterocutaneous (EC) fistula on left side of the abdomen:
Due to prior G tube. Usually expresses green-yellow discharge. 
Patient had an episode of bleeding from EC fistula. The fistula 
is trying to close-up but that causes painful collection 
collection then it opens up and drains and the cycle repeats. 
Surgical intervention is not indicated.  

# Intermittent, partial small bowel obstruction (resolved):
# Chronic constipation:
Acute on chronic abdominal pain associated with PO intake and 
lack of BM x48-72 hours. Endorses similar episodes in the past. 
KUB showed multiple air-fluid levels. Surgery were consulted and 
recommended to watch the patient as she is high risk for 
surgical interventions given her complicated past surgical 
history and "frozen abdomen". Gastrografin follow-through (3 
KUBs over 48 hours) showed delayed but eventual passage of 
contrast material consistent with resolving partial bowel 
obstruction. Improved with lactulose enemas and restarting home 
Metoclopramide for delayed gastric emptying. On discharge, 
patient was able to tolerate regular diet. She was sent home on 
lactulose 30ml TID, miralax QD and bisacodyl suppository PRN. 
Additionally, she was counseled extensively on minimizing 
opiates given that these medications are likely exacerbating her 
slow gastric emptying and constipation. 

# Acute on chronic abdominal pain: etiology unclear, though 
reportedly has a "frozen abdomen" per surgery. DDX includes 
chronic constipation, biliary colic, intermittent SBOs, 
inflammation around the EC fistula. Discharged with 1 week 
supply of home Tramadol and Hydromorphone. 

# Right hydronephrosis, new:
Incidental finding on U/S and MRCP iso acute on chronic 
abdominal pain. Urology consulted and recommended CT 
non-contrast that was negative for obstructing stone. Pelvic U/S 
performed to evaluate mirena ___ years overdue) and was normal. 

# Biliary colic: 
Post-prandial abdominal pain, possibly secondary to biliary 
colic given gallstones on RUQUS. Started on ursodiol. Would 
defer surgery given above.

CHRONIC ISSUES:
# Alcoholic cirrhosis
Complicated by HE, SBP, ascites. ___ B, MELD 12 on 
discharge ___. Followed by Dr. ___.

Studies
===============
CT A/P ___: 1. Interval removal of the jejunostomy without focal 
fluid collections to suggest abscess formation. Evaluation for a 
fistula is limited without IV contrast. Adjacent fat stranding 
and subcutaneous emphysema are expected. 2. Diffuse distension 
of small bowel loops with air-fluid levels, unchanged compared 
to prior, likely representing ileus. 3. Cirrhotic appearing 
liver with sequela of portal hypertension including splenomegaly 
and diffuse anasarca. 4. Consolidation at the left lung base, 
likely atelectasis, however underlying infection cannot entirely 
be excluded. 5. Unchanged mild right hydronephrosis. 6. 
Cholelithiasis. J tube 

ABDOMINAL US ___: Transverse and sagittal images were obtained 
of the superficial tissues of the left lateral hemiabdomen.  In 
the region of patient's J tube, there is bowel seen underlying 
the tube, with no abscess identified. 

CXR ___:  Scattered opacities throughout the left lung likely 
reflect atelectasis, similar to prior, however a superimposed 
infection would be hard to exclude.

Brief Hospital Course:
___ with EtOH cirrhosis complicated by ascites, SBP, HE, and 
HRS, s/p Roux-en-Y gastric bypass c/b recurrent anastomotic 
strictures requiring multiple endoscopic dilations, and multiple 
abdominal surgeries for bowel anastomosis complications who 
presented from home with acute on chronic abdominal pain. 
Hospital course was complicated by ___ tube cellulitis, 
Klebsiella bacteremia, and J-tube dislodgement and eventual 
removal. 

#Abdominal pain, acute on chronic
#Gastric dysmotility
#Ileus, chronic partial obstruction, strictures
#Multiple abdominal surgeries
Patient presented with acute worsening of chronic abdominal 
pain. Imaging (ultrasound and KUB) was notable for 
cholelithiasis and mildly dilated loops of bowel, consistent 
with known ileus vs obstruction, otherwise work-up unrevealing. 
Concern for intolerance of higher tube feeding rate. She was 
continued on an aggressive bowel regimen, including 
methylnaltrexone. She initially received breakthrough IV pain 
medications, transitioned to Dilaudid 2 mg PO q6h prn 
breakthrough pain before discharge. During her hospitalization, 
the patient's J-tube fell out twice and was eventually removed 
after extensive discussion between Hepatology, Interventional 
Radiology, and Transplant Surgery. She was sent home on TPN. The 
plan is to possibly try to use her g-tube in the future, but 
keep her NPO except drinks that she can tolerate for now.

#Cellulitis
#J-tube dislodgement
Initial exam was concerning for erythema and drainage around 
J-tube site, consistent with cellulitis. While in the hospital, 
her tube dislodged. She is s/p replacement by ___, requiring 
upsizing ___ large tract. It then fell out again, after 
discussing with ___ it was decided to place suture string around 
the bumper to keep it in place. She was started on treatment 
dose Bactrim to complete a x7 day course for cellulitis ___ 
- ___, but in the setting of persistent erythema and pus 
started on IV vancomycin (___). Her j-tube was removed 
on ___ after extensive discussion between Hepatology, 
Interventional Radiology, and Transplant Surgery. The future 
plans are to continue TPN for the short term and then to 
possibly try use her g-tube in the future. J-tube site with 
ostomy bag in place. Patient was educated on ostomy care while 
inpatient and will continue with changes. 

#Klebsiella bacteremia:
In the setting of worsened abdominal pain, infectious work-up 
was sent which was notable for Klebsiella bacteremia. Concern 
for intraabdominal translocation or cellulitis as source. Her 
PICC was removed, replaced on ___. She initially received 
broad spectrum antibiotics, and was narrowed to CTX following 
sensitivities with plan to complete a x14 day course (D1 ___ 
- ___.

#Malnutrition:
Patient is dependent on tube feeds and TPN for nutrition given 
inability to tolerate goal rate tube feeds due to nausea, 
abdominal pain. She was initially started on tube feeds at 
20cc/hr, tolerating without difficulty, but complicated by J 
tube dislodgment x2. She was continued on TPN, which she will be 
continued on as an outpatient. 

#Anemia
Multifactorial given liver disease, poor nutrition, and chronic 
illness. She had no evidence of active bleed. She received 
intermittent transfusions for goal Hgb >7.

#EtOH Cirrhosis
#Volume overload 
Childs C, MELD-Na 22. Previously complicated by ascites, HE, 
SBP, and HRS. Exam was concerning for mild hypervolemia. Her 
diuretics were initially held in setting of active infection, 
restarted at dose of torsemide 40mg and spironolactone 200mg 
prior to discharge. Her torsemide dose was increased to 80 mg 
due to volume overload in the setting of receiving large volumes 
of TPN. She was continued on lactulose/rifaximin for hepatic 
encephalopathy. Bactrim was switched to ciprofloxacin for SBP 
ppx in the setting of persistent blood stream infections likely 
stemming from an intraabdominal source. Midodrine increased to 
10mg TID for hypotension. Continued on MVI/thiamine/folate for 
malnutrition. She is not considered a transplant candidate at 
this time due to multiple medical conditions. Palliative Care 
was consulted for symptoms management and a goals of care 
discussion and the patient wished to pursue aggressive medical 
management at this time. 

#Coagulopathy
Patient noted to have elevated ___, so vitamin K was added to 
her TPN, but it did not lower her coags, so the vitamin K was 
stopped, as this was felt to be due to her liver disease. 

#Esophagitis: 
Noted on EGD ___, not noted on EGD from ___. She was 
continued on lansoprazole daily

#Hyponatremia
Patient intermittently hyponatremia, with Na as low as 130. This 
initially responded to albumin dosing as she was felt to be dry, 
but later, as she gained weight and was volume overloaded on 
exam, this was felt to be secondary to generalized volume 
overload. She had no neurologic symptoms. 

#Depression/anxiety: 
She was continued on her home escitalopram 20 mg daily.

#Seizures: 
She was continued on her home LevETIRAcetam 1000mg PO BID

PERTINENT IMAGING:
====================
___ CXR:
Left-sided PICC terminates in the low SVC without evidence of 
pneumothorax. 
Left lower lobe opacity corresponds to chronic loculated pleural 
fluid and 
atelectasis as seen on abdominal CT. Left mid lung 
atelectasis/scarring is 
seen. Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable. 
  
No overt pulmonary edema. 

___ CT Abd/pelvis:
1. Of note, this is a suboptimal study due to body habitus.  
Within these 
limitations, diffuse dilatation of multiple small bowel loops 
are again noted without definite transition point. 
2. Moderate hydronephrosis is again seen without definite source 
of 
obstruction, similar to the prior study on ___. 
3. Postsurgical changes are noted following Roux-en-Y gastric 
bypass.  
Incidental note is made of a G-tube and a J-tube. 
4. Consolidations are seen in the left lower lobe, which can be 
concerning for infection in the appropriate clinical setting. 
5. Small loculated left pleural effusions unchanged. 
6. Splenomegaly and cholelithiasis. 
7. Diffuse anasarca, unchanged. 

___ TTE:
IMPRESSION: Biatrial enlargement. Mildly dilated left ventricle 
with preserved biventricular systolic function. Mildly dilated 
right ventricle with preserved function. Mild pulmonary artery 
systolic hypertension. Ascites is present. 

___ Abdominal US:
Somewhat limited evaluation secondary to poor patient tenderness 
and poor 
acoustic windows.  No definite collection identified around the 
entry sites of the J-tube or G-tube. 

___ Gastrostomy tube exchange: 
1.  Appropriately positioned new 16 ___ MIC gastrostomy tube.

___ Abd xray:
Probable ileus, grossly unchanged.  No gross free air.

 
Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ is a ___ year old woman with history of alcoholic 
cirrhosis c/b ascites, HE, SBP, and HRS as well as Roux-en-Y 
gastric bypass c/b recurrent anastomotic strictures requiring 
multiple endoscopic dilations c/b perforation requiring multiple 
abdominal surgeries. She is now s/p multiple admissions, most 
recently from ___ for persistent obstructive symptoms and 
malnutrition, found to have an ileus and discharged on 
TPN/trickle feeds, readmitted with volume overload, found to 
have likely PICC-associated enterococcus bacteremia.

#Anasarca: Patient presented with anasarca and 50 pound weight 
gain in the last month. Likely due to cirrhosis and low protein 
from malnutrition. Pt diuresed with high doses of torsemide and 
spironolactone back to dry weight (92.53 kg/ 203.99 lb on 
discharge). Discharged on 100mg spironolactone and 40mg 
torsemide daily.

#Enterococcus Bacteremia: Blood cultures on admission grew 
vancomycin sensitive enterococcus from PICC line. PICC was 
discontinued and patient was switched from vanc -> daptomycin on 
___ (given history of VRE) and narrowed back to vancomycin 
(___) after return of cultures. She had a murmur on exam (old); 
TTE this admission without obvious vegetation. Otherwise, HD 
stable. PICC line replaced on ___. Repeat cultures were 
negative following the start of antibiotics. She ultimately 
completed 2 weeks of vancomycin on ___. Discharged off 
antibiotics. Attempted to increase tube feeds repeatedly during 
admission, with the hope of getting enough nutrition through 
tube feeds that TPN and PICC line could be discontinued, but 
unable to tolerate tube feeds at a high enough rate to be 
sufficient as singular source of nutrition, and thus PICC 
remained in place on discharge.

#Decompensated ETOH Cirrhosis: History of Childs C cirrhosis c/b 
ascites, HE, SBP, and HRS. MELD-Na 18 on admission, Childs C. 
Grossly overloaded. No varices on last EGD in ___. Hgb slowly 
trended down, s/p 1u pRBC on ___ with appropriate response. 
Stable upon discharge. No signs of active GI bleed. No signs of 
SBP or HE. Etiology of chronic decompensated state likely 
multifactorial, from large TPN volumes, malnutrition, and 
bacteremia this admission. Continued lactulose and rifaximin 
550mg BID, pantoprazole 40 mg daily, midodrine 5 mg TID, Bactrim 
ppx. As per above, pt discharged on 100mg spironolactone and 
40mg torsemide daily.

#Cellulitis: Noted to have erythema with purulent discharge 
around G/J tube. Previously treated for cellulitis during last 
hospitalization with doxycycline 100 mg BID x 7 days. Obtained 
culture and started vancomycin ___, briefly on daptomycin given 
history of VRE, but narrowed back to vancomycin as of ___. 
Completed 2 weeks of treatment on ___ (duration of therapy 
was for bacteremia, but more than adequate for cellulitis). 
Wound culture grew mixed flora. Ultrasound unremarkable. 
Erythema resolved and drainage improved following upsize of 
G-tube and antibiotic therapy.

#Abdominal pain: Acute on chronic abdominal pain. CT abdomen 
limited this admission, but showed diffuse dilation of small 
bowel, similar to previous studies, and no signs of infection. 
Surgery evaluated in ED and felt there was no acute change in 
abdominal pain. Remained HD stable and without leukocytosis. 
Likely worsened by volume overload and acutely worsened with 
tube feeds at rates > 45cc/hr. Discharged with tube feeds 
running at 45cc/hr. Seen by GI motility team who recommended a 
trial of methylnatrexone x 3 days, which appeared to help 
(slightly) with the patient's abdominal pain and motility. 
Methylnatrexone 12mg subQ daily was prescribed for the patient 
to continue taking as an outpatient, and she was able to 
successfully inject herself prior to discharge. Otherwise, 
discharged without changes to home regimen (tramadol 100 mg BID, 
hyoscyamine 0.125 mg QID prn, metoclopramide 10 mg q6h, 
simethicone prn). She will follow-up with the motility team as 
an outpatient.

#Malnutrition: PICC initially placed ___ and TPN started ___ 
in the setting an ileus and poor po intake. Had also been on 
trickle tube feeds Osmolite 1.5 @ 5 ml/hr at home, prior to 
admission. She reported minimal po intake and presented 
dependent on TPN. TPN stopped ___ after ___ pulled given 
bacteremia, restarted ___ after a new PICC was placed. Tube 
feeds were slowly titrated up. She did not tolerate feeds >60 
cc/hr and was ultimately discharged on TPN through PICC and tube 
feeds at 60 cc/hr.

#Anemia: Hgb 7.4 on admission, stable from baseline ___. Likely 
multifactorial given liver disease, poor nutrition, and chronic 
illness in general. Previous hemolysis labs negative. Iron 
studies showed elevated ferritin, low TIBC, low transferrin, low 
normal iron, overall consistent with anemia of 
inflammation/chronic disease. Received 1U pRBCs during admission 
with appropriate response.

CHRONIC/STABLE/RESOLVED ISSUES:
================================
#Loculated pleural effusion. Noted to have chronic loculated 
pleural effusion and atelectasis on CXR and CT abd. Patient 
reports mild SOB but without cough, fever, or chills. Low 
concern for PNA, antibiotics were not given for this issue. 

#Depression/anxiety: Continued home escitalopram 20 mg daily.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___, 

WHY WERE YOU ADMITTED TO THE HOSPITAL?
- You were retaining a lot of fluid. 

WHAT HAPPENED WHILE YOU WERE IN THE HOSPITAL?
- You were treated with water pills (diuretics - specifically, 
torsemide and spironolactone) to get extra fluid out of your 
system.
- You were found to have bacteria growing in your blood, we 
think this infection was caused by your PICC line. Your PICC 
line was taken out and a new one was put in. You were treated 
with antibiotics through your PICC line for 2 weeks.
- We tried to switch you from taking TPN through your PICC line 
for nutrition to tube feeds through your G-tube, but had a very 
difficult time managing your pain and nausea while you were on 
the tube feeds. We even exchanged your G-tube for a different 
G-tube to see if that would help, but it didn't.
- You were seen by our motility team, who specialize in issues 
of moving food through your GI tract, and we tried a medication 
called methylnatrexone to help your GI tract move and improve 
your pain. It seemed to help a little, so we will continue to 
have you take this medicine at home.

WHAT WILL HAPPEN WHEN YOU LEAVE THE HOSPITAL?
- Continue to have TPN through your PICC line and tube feeds 
through your G-tube.
- Continue to take all of your medicines as prescribed.
- You will see your primary care doctor and gastroenterologist 
in the office (see below for details).

It was a pleasure caring for you.

Sincerely,
Your ___ Care Team
