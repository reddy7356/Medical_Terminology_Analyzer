POSTBYPASS:
There is a bioprosthetic aortic valve in the aortic position.

There are no paravalvular leaks seen and no AI.

LV systolic function remains normal with estimated EF>55%. Other

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the hospital and brought to the 
operating room on ___ where the patient underwent re-do

used for surgical antibiotic prophylaxis.  POD 1 found the 
patient extubated, alert and oriented and breathing comfortably. 
 The patient was neurologically intact and hemodynamically 
stable on no inotropic or vasopressor support.  Beta blocker was 
initiated and the patient was gently diuresed toward the 
preoperative weight.  The patient was transferred to the 
telemetry floor for further recovery.  Chest tubes and pacing 
wires were discontinued without complication.  The patient was 
evaluated by the physical therapy service for assistance with 
strength and mobility.  By the time of discharge on POD #4 the 
patient was ambulating freely, the wound was healing and pain 
was controlled with oral analgesics.  The patient was discharged
