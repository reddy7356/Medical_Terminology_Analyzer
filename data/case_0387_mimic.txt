Brief Hospital Course:
Ms ___ was admitted to the GYN service for treatment of a 
pelvic abscess in the setting of recent surgery (TAH on ___. 
 She was started on IV zosyn and flagyl which she remained on 
for a total of 3 days before being switched to oral flagyl and 
levofloxacin.  On hospital day 2 she had a transvaginal pelvic 
drain placed.  Please see procedure note for full details.  On 
hospital day 3 she was transitioned to oral flagyl and 
levofloxacin.  On day 3 her initial abscess culture grew 
enterococcus bacteria.  Infectious disease was then consulted.  
They recommended treatment with vancomycin and continuing her 
oral flagyl and levofloxacin.  She had a PICC line placed to 
facilitate outpatient access.  On hospital day 4, follow-up 
pelvic u/s of her drain revealed that it was no longer in the 
fluid collection so her drain was removed.  At this point, 
interventional radiology attempted to drain the remaining 
pockets but the patient was unable to tolerate the procedure.  
After discussing the option of general anesthesia for drainage 
versus watching and waiting with follow-up ultrasound, because 
her condition had improved, the decision was made to follow her 
clinically and with U/S rather than drain the remaining pockets. 
 On hospital day 5 her vancomycin trough was low at 9.8 so her 
vancomycin dose was increased from 1000 mg BID to ___ mg BID.  
Her initial WBC count was 16.7 and it decreased to 5.2 with 
zosyn and flagyl.  She also was febrile to 101.4 on admission 
___ @0130) but then became afebrile for the rest of her 
admission.  Otherwise, she was reaching her milestones 
post-operatively.  She was able to tolerate a regular diet, 
ambulate, have BMs and flatus, and control her pain.  She was 
discharged on hospital day 5 on vancomycin, levofloxacin and 
flagyl.  She was also discharged with ___, infectious disease 
follow-up as well as follow-up with Dr. ___.
