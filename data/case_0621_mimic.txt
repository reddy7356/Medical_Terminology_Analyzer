a psychiatrist. Starting ___, these events started to 
become
more noticable to others and occurred twice between ___.

Ictal SPECT:  No abnormal activity to identify a seizure focus.
___ EEG: This is an abnormal continuous EMU monitoring study 
because of 
R>L bilateral independent temporal epileptiform discharges 
consistent with potential epileptogenic foci over these regions. 
Background generally captures an alpha rhythm which, at times, 
is high in amplitude and does contain some sharp features. 

There are four button pushes for clinical events where the 
patient 
appears to stare off but is unresponsive. No change from the 
background 
telemetry during any of the events. There is no clear change in 
the 
background at these times and there are no definite 
electrographic seizures. 
  

 
Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ is a ___ woman with migraines who presents for 
seizure characterization and medication withdrawal. Typical 
spells start with her feeling "out of it," and she has 
difficulty getting words out with some slurred speech. Body 
tends to shake, eyes open, lasts between ___ minutes. Home AED: 
1125mg keppra po BID. EEG showing some sharp wave discharges in 
bilateral temporal regions both awake and asleep but did not 
correlate with events. Tapered off keppra, still did not see 
correlation between discharges. Ictal SPECT done with one of her 
events did not indicate epileptogenic focus. Unable to obtain 
interictal SPECT during this hospitalization as she had an event 
prior to scheduled time. She will obtain this test in addition 
to a seizure protocol MRI as an outpatient. She was started on 
oxcarbazepine 600mg BID on ___ with instructions to titrate 
up to 900mg BID in one week. On discharge, she was stable, 
voiding, afebrile, and ambulating.
