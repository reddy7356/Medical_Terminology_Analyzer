Brief Hospital Course:
___ y/o M with history of BPH, back pain, and chronic venous 
stasis admitted after a fall.  
 
#Fall: Differential included orthostasis vs. cardiac etiologies 
(arrhythmia vs ACS, which is unlikely given no changes on EKG) 
vs seizure (which is unlikely given no postictal symptoms) vs 
infection (which is unlikely given no focal infectious symptoms 
and negative infectious studies including UA, blood cultures, 
ans CXR) vs mechanical. Unclear whether patient syncopized. 
Occurred in setting of standing up from bed, most likely 
orthostatic. It is possible that patient is somewhat volume 
depleted in setting of increased lasix dose recently (patient 
took 40 mg instead of 20 mg for 3 days recently). Elevated WBC 
was concerning for infection, but patient was without fevers or 
focal infectious symptoms and UA, blood cultures and CXR were 
negative for infection. Leukocytosis may also be suggestive of 
paraneoplastic syndrome given finding of 6mm spiculated nodule 
in left lower lobe.  This nodule needs to be followed up with 
imaging in the outpatient setting. Patient has chronic venous 
stasis with venous ulcers on his lower extremities but the 
ulcers did not appear infected. Patient was also on multiple 
medications which could predispose him to dizziness and falls 
including desmopressin (which he is on for unclear reasons, ? 
for BPH and nocturnal enuresis), cetirizine, oxycontin, 
pramipexole (which are all prescribed by various specialists).  
His cetirizine, amlodipine, pramipexole, desmopressin and 
vesicare were discontinued.  His lasix was held and will be 
restarted at a lower dose of 20 mg PO daily after discharge.  He 
was encouraged to eat and drink. He was monitored on telemetry 
without any events. He was evaluated by physical therapy who 
recommended rehab. 

#Leukocytosis: WBC was elevated to 20 on admission and 
downtrended to 14 during hospitalization.  Infectious workup was 
negative.  Leukocytosis may be related to paraneoplastic 
syndrome given the finding of a 6 mm spiculated mass on chest 
CT. This mass requires follow-up imaging in the outpatient 
setting.  

#Mass on chest CT: Patient was found to have 6 mm spiculated 
mass on chest CT on admission. This will need to be followed up 
in the outpatient setting with repeat imaging.

#Pain: Patient was complaining of neck pain, but imaging was 
negative, and he had no tenderness to palpation along spine. He 
does have baseline back pain (? secondary to previous falls). He 
received standing tylenol and was continued on his home 
oxycontin and lidocaine patch.

# ___: On admission Cr was ___ outpatient NP, patient's Cr 
was normal on recent labs. Patient's lasix was held and patient 
was encouraged to eat and drink.  Cr came down to normal during 
hospitalization.    

# Leg wounds: Patient was seen by vascular medicine clinic 
earlier this month; they found no evidence that peripheral 
arterial disease or venous insufficiency was contributing. 
Ulcers appear to be due to chronic venous stasis and there is no 
evidence of suprainfection.  Patient received wound care per 
previous wound care recs.  

# HTN:
Pt was mildly hypertensive (SBP 130-160 range) on discharge. 
Amlodipine was discontinued and metoprolol dose decreased. Lasix 
was also held. This was thought to be the etiology of HTN. Lasix 
was re-started at lower dose on discharge and we recommend 
continued trending of VS (please consider lisinopril for BP 
control in the future). 
 
# BPH : Patient was continued on home tamsulosin. Solifenacin 
was discontinued.  

# Code: Full    
# Emergency Contact: ___ (nephew) ___, 
___ ___ ___ (friend) cell 
___  
 
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
-Please ensure that patient has follow-up (3 months) imaging of 
6 mm spiculated mass found on chest CT
-Please follow-up final blood cultures from ___
-Please ensure patient eats and drinks to remain hydrated
-Please ensure patient's room does not get too hot
-Please minimize the amount of medications (particularly 
sedating medications that increase his risk to fall) patient is 
on to avoid polypharmacy. Please note that vesicare, 
desmopressin, cetirizine, amlodipine and pramipexole were 
discontinued during this hospitalization.
-If patient is on metoprolol for hypertension, please consider 
changing patient to an ACE-inhibitor for hypertension instead
-Please monitor BPs and continue to adjust anti-hypertensive 
regimen 
-Please ensure patient is fit for compression stockings and 
wears compression stockings. Please ensure lower extremity 
elevation.  
- Please continue to monitor and evaluate for etiology of 
leukocytosis (no evidence of infection during this 
hospitalization, differential dx includes paraneoplastic 
process).

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,

It was a pleasure taking care of you at ___. You were admitted 
after a fall at home. You were likely dehydrated.  You were 
encouraged to eat and drink here in the hospital and your 
condition continued to improve. You were also taking several 
medications that are sedating and put you at risk of falling 
prior to admission.  Some of these medications were discontinued 
in order to decrease your risk of falling.

You were also found to have a lung mass and an elevated white 
cell count. We recommend that you follow up closely with your 
primary care doctor to address these findings. 

Please keep your follow-up appointments as below.  Please return 
to the emergency room if you experience fevers, chills, 
confusion, weakness, pain urinating, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, 
or any other new or concerning symptoms.  

We wish you the best,
Your ___ team
