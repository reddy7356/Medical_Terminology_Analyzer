Studies:
CHEST (PA & LAT)Study Date of ___ 8:44 ___
FINDINGS: 
 
PA and lateral views of the chest provided.  Left chest wall 
AICD is again
seen with leads extending into the region the right atrium and 
right
ventricle.  The lungs are hyperinflated and remain clear.  There 
is no focal
consolidation, large effusion, pneumothorax.  No signs of 
congestion or edema.
Cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable and remains within normal 
limits. 
Stable blunting of the right CP angle is related to mild 
pleuroparenchymal
scarring.  Imaged bony structures are intact.  Clips are noted 
in the right
upper abdomen.
 
IMPRESSION: 
 
Emphysema without superimposed pneumonia.
 
Brief Hospital Course:
Information for Outpatient ___ w/ extensive PMHx 
including CAD w/ AICD, COPD (on no medications, by her choice), 
HFrEF (on Lasix M/W/S), lung cancer s/p resection, CAD, bicuspid 
aortic valve, presents with URI type symptoms, oxygen 
desaturation. Symptoms improved with prednisone and 
azithromycin, and O2 sats were > 95% with ambulation. Patient 
will be treated for COPD exacerbation iso URI. Of note, patient 
described vasoconstriction of the digits, and this may have 
contributed to her desaturations prior to admission.

ACUTE ISSUES: 
=============
#Exertional hypoxia
#COPD exacerbation
Patient noted to be hypoxic on ambulation in clinic, with recent 
URI type
symptoms without pneumonia on CXR. Pt noted increase in sputum 
production + hypoxia w/ ambulation. As above, pt has likely 
Raynaud's per history which can contribute to variation in 
ambulatory O2. No recent PFTs. Not currently being treated for 
COPD by patient's choice. Could represent URI w/ progression of 
underlying COPD or COPD exacerbation. Improved with steroids and 
azithromycin given in ED and continued to treat for COPD 
exacerbation.

#Lactic Acidosis: Uptrending lactate during admission, however 
no signs ___ or other hypoperfusion on exam. Possibly 
spurious, for example iso tourniquet. No other clinical 
indicators of hypoperfusion or renal impairment.

CHRONIC ISSUES:
================
#CAD s/p MI
Continued aspirin.

#CHF with decreased EF
Held Lasix, ___ iso elevated lactate, can resume after d/c given 
excellent clinical status.

#HLD
Continued statin

#Deconditioning
Pt may have some deconditioning contributing to SOB w/ exertion,
and patient's family concerned about strength. No acute need for 
___ at home or in rehab facility, but patient may benefit from ___ 
as outpatient.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
======================
[ ] F/u with PCP ___
[ ] complete 5D course of prednisone (___)
[ ] complete 5D course of azithromycin (___)
[ ] when assessing oxygen saturation levels in the future, 
monitor for vasoconstriction of the digits, at times O2 monitors 
had difficulty reading accurate O2 saturations while 
hospitalized
[ ] Patient may benefit from PFTs as outpatient as has not had 
recent set
[ ] Follow up volume status and blood pressure at PCP follow up 
___ and consider restarting Lasix and ___. 
[ ] Check lactate ___ to ensure resolution
