Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ is a pleasant ___ year old gentleman with a history 
of AFib s/p mini-MAZE ___ and AV nodal ablation ___, sick 
sinus syndrome s/p BiV PPM ___, CAD s/p PCI of RCA ___, 
multiple prior CVA/TIA who presents with a chief complaint of 
syncope that was found to be likely related to panic disorder 
versus a complex migraine.
.
ACTIVE ISSUES:
1.  SYNCOPE:  He had five previous episodes of syncope that had 
primarily occurred on exertion and were preceded by a severe 
frontal headache and diffuse weakness.  He had initially 
presented to an OSH on the morning of admission and underwent 
negative head CT prior to transfer.  He had experienced these 
symptoms frequently in the past, though noted improvement and 
eventual resolution following his mini-MAZE and ablation 
procedures.  For this reason, his syncope was thought to be 
secondary arrhythmia versus PPM malfunction.  EP interrogated 
his pacemaker on HD1 and found it to be functioning properly.  
On HD2, the patient experienced a severe frontal headache with 
diaphoresis, lightheadedness,  and severe left sided weakness of 
the arm and leg such that he could scarcely lift his extremities 
off the bed.  His vital signs were normal and he did not drop 
his BP.   Given his history of multiple TIA and CVA, the stroke 
team was consulted.  They felt that he was experiencing a 
complex migraine picture versus panic attack given his 
improvement with xanax.  A noncontrast CT was ordered and 
demonstrated no acute abnormality.  He improved within a few 
hours with normal neurologic exam, and was discharged with 
neurology followup.  He was started on propranolol for migraine 
prophylaxis.
.
2. ATRIAL FIBRILLATION:  He is status post mini-MAZE and AV 
nodal ablation with PPM placement.  He was AV paced on telemetry 
without abnormality.  He was continued on dofetilide and 
coumadin.
.
INACTIVE ISSUES
.
3.  Previous TIA/CVA:  he provides a history of multiple embolic 
and thrombotic strokes in the past though he bares no neurologic 
sequelae of these episodes on examination.  As he claims to have 
suffered strokes despite therapeutic INR, neurology recommended 
echo with bubble study, though per patient he already had one 
many years back with the finding of small PFO that was not 
closed.  He was therefore  continued on warfarin and aspirin.  
His INR was elevated on admission at 4.5, and so it was held for 
a day, and became quickly subtherapeutic at 1.8 on the day of 
discharge.  His INR had widely fluctuated over the past few 
months, and he was discharged on his home dose warfarin with 
instruction to undergo monitoring soon.
.
4. Weakness and Fatigue: He expresses long-standing history of 
progressive fatigue of unclear etiology. His TSH was normal.  
.
5.  Bipolar disease: continued home meds
.
6.  Anxiety:  continued clonazepam, with prn alprazolam for 
severe anxiety
.
7.  Restless legs syndrome:  continued mirapex at home dose
.
8.  Sleep-disordered breathing, will continue CPAP
.
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
.
Will require followup of INR and possible referral to headache 
clinic.

for which we activated the stroke team.  It appears that you had 
a complex migraine-like headache that caused you to fall.

The following  changes were made to your medications:
1. START PROPRANOLOL 40mg twice a day to help prevent headaches. 
 This medicine takes several weeks to take effect, and will 
likely need to be increased by your doctor as an outpatient.
2. DECREASE ASPIRIN to 81mg daily.  

Please continue taking all other medications as prescribed by 
your other doctors.

IMAGING / STUDIES:
# CHEST (PA & LAT) ___ at 2:49 AM):
COMPARISON: ___. 
FINDINGS: A pacer unit projects over the left upper chest with 
leads in the right atrium and right ventricle. The 
cardiomediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged from prior 
study. The lungs are clear. There is no pleural effusion or 
pneumothorax. The osseous structures are intact.
IMPRESSION: No acute cardiopulmonary process.
.
# ECG ___ at 8:35:24 ___:
A-V sequential pacing at 80 beats per minute. Compared to the 
previous tracing of ___ no diagnostic interim change..
.
# ECG ___ at 12:45:26 ___: 
Atrial and ventricular sequential pacing. Compared to the 
previous tracing
of ___ there is no significant change.
.
# Cardiac Cath (___):
1. Coronary angiography in this right-dominant system 
demonstrated no angiographically apparent disease in the LMCA, 
LAD, LCx or RCA. The prior RCA stent was widely patent.
2. Limited resting hemodynamics revealed normal left-sided 
filling pressures. The systemic arterial blood pressure was 
normal. There was no gradient upon pullback of the catheter from 
the left ventricle to the aorta.
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. No coronary artery disease.
2. RCA stent patent.
3. Normal left-sided filling pressures.
4. No aortic stenosis.
.

 
Brief Hospital Course:
The patient is a ___ year old male with extensive cardiac history 
including refractory AFib s/p multiple procedures and AV nodal 
ablation with PPM placement who presents with recurrence of 
syncopal episodes, chest heaviness, and SOB concerning for 
ischemia versus arrhythmia.
.
# Syncope: The patient has had multiple prior episodes but the 
etiology remains unclear.  He was recently admitted on ___ 
for similar symptoms.  He does not have symptoms suggestive of a 
seizure such as postictal state or incontinence. His syncopal 
episodes could possibly be related to an arrhythmia, although 
there is no concrete evidence of this. Alternatively, many of 
his symptoms in the past have also occurred with headache and 
per Neurology work up may be manifestation of complex migraines. 
 Panic attacks are another plausible etiology, particularly 
given the patient's anxiety over his recent stress test 
findings.  PPM interrogation on ___ by EP showed that the 
device was functioning properly.  No significant arrhythmia was 
seen on telemetry during his stay.
.
# Chest pain: Given his extensive cardiac history, a cardiac 
etiology for his symptoms must be considered.  His negative 
D-dimer makes PE very unlikely and clear CXR makes a pulmonary 
etiology less likely as well.  Cardiac enzymes were negative x4. 
He recently (___) underwent stress imaging, which revealed 
new inferior wall hypokinesis. Given that finding and recent 
exacerbation of symptoms, he was previously planned for 
outpatient cath on ___ to evaluate for any intervenable 
disease.  His cath was expedited on this admission to rule out 
significant CAD as a cause of his symptoms.  Cardiac cath on 
___ with a right radial approach showed no significant 
obstructive coronary disease and no interventions were 
performed.  He tolerated the procedure well without any 
immediate complications.  He was continued on his prior cardiac 
regimen.
.
# Pump: Echo ___ showed LVEF 55-60% with no focal wall 
motion abnormalities noted.  Stress imaging on ___ showed a 
new small fixed inferior wall perfusion defect with focal 
hypokinesis and LVEF 44%.  This represents a significant 
decrease in LVEF.  He did not have any current clinical signs or 
symptoms of CHF.  Repeat TTE could be considered as an 
outpatient.
.
# Atrial fibrillation: The patient is status post two prior 
pulmonary vein isolations (___) with subsequent 
recurrences followed by mini-maze with left atrial excision.  He 
is also s/p AV nodal ablation in ___.  He reports a history of 
multiple prior TIA/CVAs, without any apparent residual deficits. 
 His PPM settings were re-adjusted during his last admission.  
He is on Warfarin 5 mg PO daily at home.  In preparation for 
cath, his Warfarin was held on ___ and he was started on a 
lower dose of Warfarin 3 mg PO daily the next day with goal INR 
<1.8 for cath.  He was bridged with a Heparin drip while 
subtherapeutic.  His INR was 1.3 at the time of his cath.  He 
was restarted on his home Warfarin regimen after his cath, with 
an extra dose of Warfarin 5 mg PO given.  He was bridged with 
Lovenox 80 mg SC BID on discharge until he achieves a 
therapeutic INR.  He was continued on Dofetilide 500 mcg PO Q12H 
during his stay.
.
# Anxiety/bipolar disorder:  He was continued on his home 
regimen of Bupropion, Lithium, and Lexapro, with Alprazolam PRN 
anxiety and Clonazepam QHS.
.
# HTN:</I> He remained normotensive and was continued on his 
home Lisinopril 10 mg PO daily and Propranolol 40 mg PO/NG BID.
.
# Headaches: He has not had any recent headaches associated with 
his current episodes.  He has had episodic headaches in the past 
associated with nausea, visual obscuration and limb 
paresthesias.  He is followed by Neurology as an outpatient. Per 
most recent Neuro note, these symptoms are felt to be consistent 
with migrainous phenomenon.  He was continued on Propranolol 40 
mg PO/NG BID.
.
# Sleep disordered breathing: He is on home CPAP and followed by 
___ in sleep clinic.  He was continued on CPAP and 
slept well with it in place overnight.
.
# Code status: DNR/DNI
