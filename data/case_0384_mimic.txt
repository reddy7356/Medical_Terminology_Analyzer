Pertinent Results:
ECHO:
Pre CPB:
No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of 
the left atrium or left atrial appendage. 
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. 
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left 
ventricular cavity is mildly dilated. Overall left ventricular 
systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). 
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests a normal left ventricular 
filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg). 
There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. 
There are three aortic valve leaflets. There is no aortic valve 
stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. 
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. 
Dr. ___ was notified in person of the results. 

Post CPB:
The patient is being A-paced on a phenylephrine infusion.
The biventricular sytoic function is preserved.

___ visible contours of the thoracic aorta are intact.  
 
Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the hospital and brought to the 
operating room on ___ where the patient underwent coronary 
artery bypass graft x 4 (see operative note for details).  
Overall the patient tolerated the procedure well and 
post-operatively was transferred to the CVICU in stable 
condition for recovery and invasive monitoring.  POD 1 found the 
patient extubated, alert and oriented and breathing comfortably. 
 The patient was neurologically intact and hemodynamically 
stable on no inotropic or vasopressor support.  Beta blocker was 
initiated and the patient was gently diuresed toward the 
preoperative weight. Unable to initiate cardiazem for RIMA graft 
due to borderline low blood pressure while on low dose 
lopressor. The patient was transferred to the telemetry floor 
for further recovery.  Chest tubes and pacing wires were 
discontinued per protocol without complication.  The patient was 
evaluated by the physical therapy service for assistance with 
strength and mobility.  By the time of discharge on POD #4 the 
patient was ambulating freely, the wound was healing and pain 
was controlled with oral analgesics.  The patient was discharged 
home on POD# 4 in good condition with appropriate follow up 
instructions.
