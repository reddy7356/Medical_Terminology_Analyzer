IMPRESSION: 
1.  Echogenic liver, likely due to fatty infiltration. Other 
forms of more severe liver disease including hepatic 
fibrosis/cirrhosis cannot be excluded. 
2.  No evidence of cholelithiasis or biliary dilatation.
 
Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ is ___ with history of anxiety/depression, ADHD, 
ETOH abuse, h/o pancreatitis (most recently ___ who is 
presenting with epigastric pain and vomiting for the last day, 
notable for elevated lipase, concerning for pancreatitis. 

#  pancreatitis: The patient was found to have elevated lipase 
in the setting of epigastric pain. BISAP score on admission was 
0. It was thought that pancreatitis was due alcohol intake. RUQ 
did not show evidence of any cholelithiasis. The patient was 
initially made NPO, pain controlled with IV Dilaudid, and given 
aggressive volume rescucitation with LR.  He also had a Dobhoff 
placed with the intention to start post pylorically tube 
feeding, however, it was pulled out overnight accidentally. The 
patient never needed to start tube feeds, as his ability to take 
PO improved on HD2. The patient was started on low fat full 
liquid diet and on the day of discharge, he was taking good PO.  
In terms of his pain control, the patient was started on IV 
Dilaudid, and we were able to transition to PO Dilaudid. The 
patient was NOT discharged on any Dilaudid. He was instructed to 
follow up with PCP on ___.

# etoh and benzo abuse: The patient reports daily drinking, with 
his last drink about 12 hours prior to presentation. He also 
reports taking daily benzos. After talking with the patient's 
PCP and psychiatrist, it was discovered that the patient was 
getting alprazolam and lorazepam prescriptions from his PCP, and 
clonazepam prescriptions from his psychiatrist. Both the 
patient's PCP and psychiatrist were unaware that the patient was 
getting benzodiazepine prescriptions from other providers. Psych 
was consulted and the patient was started on standing 
clonazepam, as well as a CIWA. Social work was consulted and the 
patient spoke with our addiction specialist ___). 
The patient stated that he was not ready for alcohol abstinence. 


# transaminitis: The patient was noted to have mild 
transaminitis on admission. LFTs were trending down during this 
admission. Alcohol cessation, as discussed above, was discussed 
with the patient. 

# leukocytosis: The patient had white count of 13.4 on 
admission; likely due to underlying pancreatic inflammation 
versus stress response. White count trended down, and was normal 
on discharge. Blood cultures no growth to date.  

# anion gap acidosis: The patient had anion gap acidosis on 
admission of 16; it was thought that this was in the setting of 
alcoholic ketoacidosis. 

# thrombocytopenia: The patient was noted to be 
thrombocytopenic, with platelets trending down on the last two 
days of discharge. Platelets on day of discharge 135.   He will 
need to get his platelets checked on ___. 

Transitional Issues:
- The patient was noted to be taking multiple different types of 
benzodiazapines, being prescribed by different providers. He was 
discharged on only one benzo (clonazepam). The patient was not 
provided with any further prescriptions. The patient was advised 
to DISPOSE of his other benzodiazepines (alprazolam and 
lorazepam), and continue ONLY on clonazepam. He has follow up 
with his PCP on ___.
- The patient was not discharged on any narcotics; no 
prescriptions were provided. He was advised to take 
acetominophen for pain control, but cautioned to NOT exceed 2 
grams daily in the setting of his underlying liver issues.
- The patient should get his platelets checked on ___ when seen by his PCP. Platelets were trending down at the 
time of discharge.
- The patient would likely benefit from outpatient sleep study.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,

It was a pleasure taking care of you while you were admitted to

having abdominal pain. We think that you have pancreatitis 
(inflammation of your pancreas) because of the alcohol that you 
drink.  We treated your pain with medications, and we advanced

cause recurrent episodes of pancreatitis, as well as liver 
disease.

Please STOP taking alprazolam and lorazepam. You should continue 
only the clonazepam, and get this prescription from ONE doctor. 
DO NOT continue to take multiple benzodiazepines.
