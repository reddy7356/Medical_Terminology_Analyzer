MR HEAD W & W/O CONTRAST; MRA BRAIN W/O CONTRAST

Reason: WEAKNESS

UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
___ year old woman with left facial and arm numbness that's query 
stroke.
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
query stroke as per neurology.
CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.

INDICATION: ___ female patient, with left facial and arm 
numbness, question stroke, to evaluate for questionable stroke, 
per neurology.

PRIOR STUDIES: CT of the head done on ___. Additional 
history, from prior studies indicate history of DVT, on Coumadin 
in the past.

TECHNIQUE: Multiplanar T1- and ___ imaging of the brain 
was performed without IV contrast. 3D TOF MR angiogram of the 
head was also performed.

FINDINGS:

MRI OF THE BRAIN WITH AND WITHOUT IV CONTRAST WAS PERFORMED 
ALONG WITH 3D TOF MR ANGIOGRAM OF THE HEAD: The signal intensity 
of the marrow in the cranial vault and the visualized cervical 
vertebrae is slightly hypointense which may be appropriate for 
the patient's age.

There are a few, scattered small, slight hyperintense foci, 2 mm 
in size, in the right parietal lobe white matter, subcortical in 
location, (series 8, image 14) a few are seen in the frontal 
subcortical white matter (series 8, image 15). Increased signal 
noted in somewhat the cerebral sulci, may be related to 
inadequate fluid signal intensity suppression or ___ 
effect on the FLAIR sequence. The major vascular flow voids are 
noted.

On the ___ images, no enhancement is noted in the 
small FLAIR hyperintense lesions. No abnormal foci of 
enhancement are noted in the brain parenchyma or in the 
meninges. There are no areas of restricted diffusion or 
intracranial hemorrhage.

3D TOF MR ANGIOGRAM OF THE HEAD:

The distal vertebral, basilar, posterior cerebral arteries are 
patent. The intracranial internal carotid arteries, including 
the petrous, cavernous and the supraclinoid segments are patent. 
The anterior and middle cerebral arteries are patent. The A1 
segment of the right anterior cerebral artery is smaller in 
caliber, representing hypoplasia.

There is no focal ___ stenosis, occlusion or aneurysm 
more than 3 mm, within the resolution of MR angiogram.

The ventricles and ___ CSF spaces are unremarkable in 
size. A small outpouching, noted from the frontal horn of the 
left lateral ventricle (series 4, image 124), can be related to 
mild asymmetry in the shape of the frontal horn or a prominent 
perivascular space or small area of gliosis (series 8, image 
14).

The left vertebral artery is dominant. The right vertebral 
artery is small in caliber, and is not visualized after the 
origin of the posterior inferior cerebellar artery, which can be 
a normal variant.

IMPRESSION:
1. A few, small ___ mm), FLAIR hyperintense lesions, in the 
bifrontal and parietal subcortical white matter, with no 
enhancement , which are nonspecific and can be related to 
postinflammatory, ___, demyelinating, vasculitis 
causes. To correlate clinically and with lab values.

2. No definite abnormal foci of enhancement are noted in the 
brain parenchyma or in the meninges.

3. No focal ___ stenosis, occlusion, or aneurysm more 
than 3 mm, within the resolution of MR angiogram of the head.

___ PICC W/O PORT  ___ 11:43 AM

Reason: Patient needs MRI under anesthesia.

UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
___ year old woman with suspected CVA and needs IV access. Unable 
to get IV access at bedside.
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
Patient needs MRI under anesthesia.
PROCEDURE NAME: ___ line placement.

INDICATION: IV access

The procedure was explained to the patient. A timeout was 
performed.

RADIOLOGIST: Drs. ___ performed the procedure. Dr. 
___ Attending ___, was present and supervised 
the entire procedure.

TECHNIQUE: Using sterile technique and local anesthesia, the 
right brachial vein was punctured under direct ultrasound 
guidance using a micropuncture set. Hard copies of ultrasound 
images were obtained before and immediately after establishing 
intravenous access. A ___ sheath was then placed over a 
guidewire and a single lumen PICC line measuring 39.0 cm in 
length was then placed through the ___ sheath with its tip 
positioned in the SVC under fluoroscopic guidance. Position of 
the catheter was confirmed by a fluoroscopic spot film of the 
chest.

The ___ sheath and guidewire were then removed. The 
catheter was secured to the skin, flushed, and a sterile 
dressing applied.

The patient tolerated the procedure well. There were no 
immediate complications.

IMPRESSION: Uncomplicated ultrasound and fluoroscopically guided 
___ single lumen PICC line placement via the right brachial 
venous approach. Final internal length is 39.0 cm, with the tip 
positioned in SVC. The line is ready to use.

ECHO (with bubble study) Conclusions:
The left atrium is normal in size. No atrial septal defect or 
patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline 
contrast with maneuvers. The estimated right atrial pressure is 
___. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and 
regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF >55%) There 
is no ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size 
and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) 
appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no 
aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve appears structurally 
normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is no mitral 
valve prolapse. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure 
is normal. There is no pericardial effusion.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of ___, no 
significant change.

IMPRESSION: No intracardiac shunt identified.
 
Brief Hospital Course:
Due to the left face and UE tingling there was a concern for 
CVA. Neurology was consulted in ER and they recommended an MRI/A 
brain was done under GA (as patient is claustrophobic and would 
not aggree to get MRI without sedation). Results as above. These 
results were discussed with neurology attending Dr ___ 
who thought that these lesions in brain were ___ 
especially as ECHO with bubble study was negative for shunt. The 
MRI was negative for acute stroke and that the symptoms patient 
presented with did not correlate with MRI findings. 

Per radiology, MRI lesions could be postinfectious, 
postinflammatory, demyelinating or vasculitis cause. Defer 
further work up to PCP in clinic for ___, rheumatologic work up 
etc. Patient was informed of these abnormal findings. It was 
discussed that the findings were (per radiology and neurology) 
not likely to be acute stroke, but do require follow up for 
above reasons. The patient was concerned this was MS but it was 
discussed that - at this time it is unclear as to what the exact 
diagnosis is, but as recommended by Dr ___ was advised to 
follow up in neurology clinic. 

Dr ___ continuation of warfarin to target 
therapeutic INR between ___. Lovenox was continued while in 
hospital as well as on discharge. This will be continued till 
INR becomes therapeutic. Patient to follow up with her 
___ clinic at ___ who calls Dr ___ 
(___) with ___ for necessary changes. ASA was continued. The 
patient aslo is on anticoagulation for DVT, PE. 

Neurology team also recommended that the patient be worked up 
for hypercoagulable state as was planned by patient's PCP Dr 
___. Some studies like lupus anticoagulant and beta 2 
miccroglobulin antibody were sent while in hospital and are 
pending at discharge. Dr ___ of these and patient advised 
to follow up with Dr ___ results. 

Patient reported skipped beats in hospital but was maintained on 
telemetry and no signifcant arrythmia was noted. At times, 
telemetry was noted to be stating NSVT. Hwoever, on discussion 
with cardiologists (Dr ___ it was determined that the strip 
was an artifact. 

The patient also had a poor IV access and because peripheral IV 
could not be done by IV RN, ___ guided PICC was placed (power 
PICC). Upon discharge this was removed.

On day of discharge, patient mentioned to hospitalist that she 
may have noticed a lump in left breast. The patient was advised 
to discuss with PC to schedule a mammogram as soon as possible. 
Her last mammogram was ___ years back per pt.

chest pain and elevated d-dimer.  
.  
#Chest pain: Very likely somatic, but pt. has Hx of PE 
documented although this was provoked by EP study. HD stable, 
not hypoxic, briefly tachycardic. D-dimer was elevated but 
entirely unhelpful as + result does not nessesarily make PE more 
likely, possibly was elevated ___ multiple attempts at 
peripheral access. Very unlikely ACS, first set of Trp negative 
after having ~2days of chest pain, did not continue ___ w/ 
CE's. Unable to get CTA chest as she had no PIV access.  Pt. 
very well known to attending, and has had multiple negative 
workups and complications from those workups for the same 
presentation of chest pain. She stated that this is the same 
pain that she always has, and that she chronically takes 
ibuprofen for it which occasionally causes her to have stomach 
bleeding. She aknowledged that her anxiety and stress are 
correlated with the pain and on d/c she stated that she would 
perform stress reduction techniques such as playing the piano 
and listening to her meditation CD to try to decrease her level 
of anxiety. She reported to us that she had lost consciousness 
for 3 minutes at the gym and was found by a paramedic, then went 
home and called Dr. ___. Dr. ___ from yesterday 
regarding this episode mentions her feeling palpitations and 
lightheadedness but no syncope. She was walking without 
difficulty throughout admission. She had periods of tachycardia 
c/w her known SVT, but was not consistently tachycardic. 
Excluding tachycardia which was transient, her WELLS score would 
have been 1.5, which would be unlikely for PE. No further workup 
was indicated as pt. has been extensively worked up for the same 
complaint repeatedly without positive results and pt. was d/c'd 
in stable condition but still complaining of chest pain and 
advised to use ibuprofen and tylenol as needed for pain. She did 
ask for vicodin for her pain at time of d/c, but that she would 
settle for some ativan for her anxiety. Given that her pain has 
a strong somatic component, it was determined that providing her 
with narcotics and benzos would not treat the real source of her 
pain and would lead to a cycle of prescribing. She was advised 
to follow up with her PCP for treatment of her somatic 
complaints as she was not interested in referal to counseling or 
psychiatry at time of d/c. Given that her previous PE was 
provoked, she is not at increased risk to have another. She did 
have a chronic appearing popliteal DVT in ___ of this year 
after having a tendon rupture. This would also be a provoked 
clot and this was gone by the time she had a repeat in ___ of 
this year.  
.  
#H/o SVT: She had several short bursts of SVT <1min after 
skipping a dose of her metoprolol. She has never been evaluated 
by an EP studay at ___, though she has been seen by Dr. 
___. She continually fails to bring her ablation records from 
OSH. She may benefit from switching to QD metoprolol or adding 
diltiazem, but this was deferred to outpt. setting. 
.  
#Positive review of systems: Pt. had multiple complaints which 
were not consistent with any clinical syndrome and her exam/VS 
were not consistent with her complaints so no further workup was 
pursued given her presentation and multiple previous negative 
workups.

Discharge Instructions:
You came to the emergency room because of chest pain and rapid 
heart rate. It is very unlikely that you have a blood clot in 
your lungs. The tests that we have for blood clots in the lungs 
can have significant complications and so we did not do any 
tests further than a blood test. You had several episodes of 
rapid heart rate, but this may have been related to not taking 
your metoprolol. 

Please take your medications exactly as prescribed

We did not change any of your medications

If you have any new or worsening chest pain, shortness of 
breath, bleeding, confusion, fevers, chills or nightsweats 
please call your doctor immediately or go to the emergency 
department.

.  
# abdominal pain: This could be her GERD or PUD given her 
history. She reports taking protonix at home and peptobismal. 
Abdominal ultrasound was normal ruling out gallbladder disease. 
U/A was negative for blood making a kidney stone highly 
unlikely. Lipase was negative making pancreatitis unlikely. 
Could be endometriosis.  Also somatization could play a role 
especially given her history. In addition, at the end of her 
stay, she reported that she recently experienced a trauma at 
work and had a lot of anxiety associated with this. We spent 
significant time discussing that she should follow up with 
social work or psychiatry regarding these issues and the 
importance of the mind body connection.
.  
# chronic chest pain: extensive work up in the past with nothing 
found. ED did a VQ scan which was negative and CXR was clear. No 
events on telemetry and she ruled out for AMI with CE. Could be 
GERD related.  
.  
# normocytic anemia: at baseline with normal iron studies, B12 
and folate. Likely related to heavy menses.  
.  
# hypothyroidism: continued synthroid

for a Holter monitor that revealed sinus rhythm with atrial and 
ventricular premature beats. This am after breakfast, she felt 
very lightheaded and felt that she might pass out. She put her

Brief Hospital Course:
#) Chest Pain - Atypical chest pain not relieved with SL NTG, 
nearly constant except when recieves dilaudid. Not reproducible 
on exam. She was ruled out by 3 sets of negative cardiac 
enzymes. EKG with very slight ST depressions in setting of sinus 
tachycardia that resolved with control of heart rate. Atrial 
tachycardia that has been documented before was seen on 
telemetry, but no concerning rhythms were seen. Her outpatient 
electrophysiologist was contacted who agreed that no further 
cardiac workup needed to be done. Her beta bblocker was 
continued. Her chest pain was treated with Toradol, and she was 
advised to continue ibuprofen as an outpatient.

#) L arm numbness and weakness - Neurologic exam is inconsistent 
with localizing peripheral or central lesion. Had thorough w/u 
by neurology 1 month ago for similar complaint that revealed 1-2 
mm FLAIR hyperintense lesions in the bifrontal and subcortical 
white matter that was of unclear significance but not thought to 
be ischemic. Possibly inflammatory vs. autoimmune changes. Given 
h/o head trauma this am, a head CT was done that was 
unremarkable. As her complaints spontaneously resolved, no 
further workup was done. Aspirin was continued.

#) h/o DVTs/PE - continued coumadin

#) Hypothyroidism - Continued synthroid.  

#) Psych - With h/o depression, anxiety, and possibly 
Munchausen's based off of OMR notes from prior admissions. As 
the patient was amenable to being discharged after the above 
workup, no further action was taken.

ablation with most recent RA of AVNRT in ___.  She was admitted 
on ___ to ___ after she experienced the sudden onset 
of pleuritic CP with palpitations while driving, similar to her 
prior 'PE pain'.  She presented to the the ___, 
whereinitial ECG showed significant inferolateral ST 
depressions. ? resolution with nitroglycerin.  CP was relief 
following morphine and ASA. ECG returned to baseline. INR was 
subtherapeutic at 1.65, and given her known severe contrast 
allergy, it was decided to increase her warfarin dose to treat 
empirically for pulmonary embolus.  There was still question as 
to whether her sx were related to ACS vs PE. She received an 
echo today showed normal LV function with no clear regional wall 
motion abnormalities.  Pharmacologic MIBI study with Lexiscan 
produced severe chest pain and significant ST depressions, which 
were both relieved with Aminophylline, nitroglycerin, and a 5 mg 
of IV metoprolol. Her perfusion imaging was normal. However, in 
view of her substantial symptoms and EKG changes with 
pharmacologic stress, she is planned for transfer to ___ for 
cardiac catheterization, which is currently being arranged. 
Sometime overnight prior to transfer she had severalruns of NSVT

IMAGING:
ECHO:
The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall 
thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is 
normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal 
(LVEF>55%). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests a normal left 
ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg). Right ventricular 
chamber size is borderline dilated and free wall motion is 
normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal 
with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic 
regurgitation. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with 
trivial mitral regurgitation. The pulmonary artery systolic 
pressure is probably normal (however the spectral Doppler 
recording of the tricuspid jet is technically suboptimal). There 
is no pericardial effusion.

CXR:
AP upright portable chest radiograph is obtained.  The lungs are 
well expanded and clear.  There is no pleural effusion or 
pneumothorax.  The heart is normal in size with normal 
cardiomediastinal contours. 
IMPRESSION:  No acute intrathoracic process. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ yo female with a PMH notable for SVT refractory to 
medications and ablations, atypical CP, and PEx2/DVT who is 
transferred from OSH for cath after being admitted with 
pleuritic CP.
.  
Chest pain: Possible causes of her CP are ACS (however she had 
clean coronaries in ___ and ___, EKG is normal without 
reported enzyme elevations) Nothing to suggest dissection, 
pericarditis, PNA or pneumothorax. Does not appear to be MSK in 
nature.  Pleuritic and associtated with tachycardia in this 
young woman with history of unprovoked VTE's on chronic coumadin 
in the setting of subtherapeutic INR raises the specter of 
recurrent PE although D-dimer was 150. In addition, repeat INR 
was 4.0 so she is therapuetic on her coumadin again despite 
being subtherapuetic on arrival to OSH.  ECHO was also 
unremarkable.  She slept for a few hours and on re-evaluation, 
her pain had improved.  She wanted to go home and we felt that 
given her extensive work up was negative that she was ok for 
discharge.  She has close follow up with Dr. ___ day after 
discharge on ___.
.  
#  Tachyarrhthmia: The Telemetry tracings from ___ 
were reviewed in detail. Possible etiologies include 
non-sustained Mono-morphic VT, SVT with abberency, or artifact. 
It was clear the the 'narrow' QRS complex marched through the 
'wide-complex' beats consistent with artifact.  We continued her 
home lopressor and she will follow up with Dr. ___ on ___. 
   
.  
# Elevated INR: Was 4 on admission.  She was not given her 
coumadin today.  She will follow up with ___ 
___ clinic to maintain a goal INR of 2.5-3.0.

# Hypothyroidism: Continue thyroxine
.  
# Anxiety: Continue lorazepam

Discharge Instructions:
You were transferred to ___ 
from another hospital for further evaluation of your chest pain. 
 Your chest pain was not cardiac in nature.  There was concern 
that this pain was related to a PE, but your D-dimer is low and 
this make it very unlikely.  In addition, your INR was elevated 
at 4.0.  We also do not believe this is referred pain from you 
abdomen.  Overall, your work up has been negative and we are 
reassured that since the pain has improved since arrival that 
you are ready to be discharged home.  

Since you INR is elevated, please do not take your coumadin 
today.  It is important that you have your INR drawn in the next 
___ hours and restart you coumadin to maintain a goal INR of 
2.5-3.

The following medication was STOPPED:
Coumadin to be restarted when INR within goal.

There were no other changes to your medication at this time.

IMAGING:
CXR (Portable AP) ___:
FINDINGS:  Portable frontal chest radiograph demonstrates no 
focal 
consolidation, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax.  The heart 
size is normal.  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours are 
normal.   
IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary process. 

TTE ___:
The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. Left 
ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and regional/global 
systolic function are normal (LVEF >55%). Transmitral and tissue 
Doppler imaging suggests normal diastolic function, and a normal 
left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg). The right 
ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with normal free wall 
contractility. The diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending 
and arch levels are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear 
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic 
stenosis or aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are 
myxomatous. There is mild bileaflet mitral valve prolapse. 
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. There is borderline 
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial 
effusion. 
IMPRESSION: normal regional and global left ventricular systolic 
function. Borderline dilation of the right ventricle with normal 
function. Mild bileaflet mitral valve prolapse without 
significant mitral regurgitation. Borderline elevation of 
pulmonary artery systolic pressure.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of ___, 
mild mitral prolapse is present on the current study. The other 
findings are similar.
 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ with h/o SVT s/p ablation and multiple PEs (saddle embolus 
___ on lifelong anticoagulation with warfarin who presented 
following 2 episodes of chest pain.

# Chest pain: Pt reported that chest pain was distinct from pain 
experienced with prior PEs and attributed it to anxiety, as both 
episodes had occurred in the setting of stressful situations at 
her new job as an ___.  Negative BNP, cardiac 
enzymes and EKG made cardiac etiology unlikely and PE ruled out 
with negative d-dimer. Pt was continued on home lorazepam and 
discharged with plan to discuss anxiety management with PCP.

# Tachyarrhthmia: Pt had single episode of tachycardia to 140s 
which resolved with lopressor 5 mg IV and 25 mg PO. It was felt 
to be most likely her recurrent SVT.  
She was continued on her home metoprolol without further 
incident. 

# History of DVT/PE: Pt reported noncompliance with warfarin due 
to inconvenience but was able to verbalize understanding of the 
risk of potentially fatal blood clots if she did not continue 
anticoagulation. INR subtherapeutic at 1.1. Pt was restarted on 
home warfarin dose with enoxaparin bridge. She expressed 
interest in possibly continuing enoxaparin in place of warfarin 
as she did not have time to go to ___ clinic 
regularly. She will discuss this option with her primary care 
provider.

# Hypotension: Pt was noted to have low blood pressure ___ 
with associated dizziness with ambulation after hydromorphone 
given for chest pain. Resolved after discontinuation of 
hydromorphone.

# Hypothyroidism: Pt has h/o hypothyroid and thyroid nodule, on 
home levothyroxine.She reported several week h/o decreased 
energy level, brittle hair and thyroid fullness and was noted to 
have assymetric thyromegaly (R>L) and tenderness to palpation on 
exam. TSH this admission was elevated at 7.2; result returned 
after patient had left the hospital.
 

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
# Hypothyroidism: Pt noted to have assymetric thyromegaly on 
exam, TSH 7.___ischarged. Will need upward 
titration of home levothyroxine and repeat TSH in ___ weeks.
# Anticoagulation: Pt discharged on enoxaparin as bridge to 
warfarin, may consider continuing in place of warfarin as this 
appears to be patient's preference. Will need repeat INR ___ at 
___. 
# Anxiety: Pt discharged with small supply of lorazepam; will 
need follow up and further management of her significant anxiety 
with consideration of SSRI, psych therapy

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,

You were admitted to our hospital with chest pain in the setting 
of anxiety. We were concerned that you might have had another 
episode of pulmonary emboli (blood clots in your lungs), but 
your tests have come back showing that you did not have these 
and also that your pain was not likely related to your heart. 
Your chest pain has gotten better. It is very important that you 
continue to take your warfarin every day because you are at risk 
of having potentially fatal blood clots. You should also 
continue to take lovenox until your primary care doctor or 
___ clinic provider instruct you to stop. Please 
continue to take all of your medications as prescribed and 
follow up in the ___ on ___ and with 
your primary care doctor on ___.
 
Followup Instructions:
___
