 - ECG: sinus, HR 60, prolonged PR, qtc 472, diffuse T wave 
flattening, biphasic atria

TTE ___
The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall 
thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity is 
moderately dilated. There is mild global left ventricular 
hypokinesis (LVEF = 45 - 50 %). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests 
an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). 
Doppler parameters are most consistent with Grade II (moderate) 
left ventricular diastolic dysfunction. Right ventricular 
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. There is abnormal 
septal motion/position. The number of aortic valve leaflets 
cannot be determined. There is no aortic valve stenosis. No 
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve appears 
structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. The 
pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined. 
There is a very small pericardial effusion. There are no 
echocardiographic signs of tamponade. 

 IMPRESSION: 
 1) Mild global LV systolic dysfunction with regional variation 
in intrinsic myocardial contractility in setting of moderate LV 
dilation c/w diffuse cardiomyopathic process.
 2) Grade II LV diastolic dysfunction with elevated LVEDP.

___ CT head
IMPRESSION: 
1. No acute intracranial abnormalities.

symptoms. NCHCT negative, TTE in ED negative for valvular

with seizure. He was monitored on telemetry and there were no 
findings except PVCs. Likely due to vasovagal episode in the 
setting of a coughing spell. On discharge, he was able to 
ambulate well.
