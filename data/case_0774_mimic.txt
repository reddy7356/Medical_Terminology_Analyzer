History of Present Illness:
___ M who originally presented to ___ 
complaining of 3 days of epigastric and chest pain, which he 
attributed to acid reflux. It was persistant despite 
pantoprazole and NSAIDs. He was seen in clinic, where EKG 
reportedly showed ST elevations in the anterolateral leads. He 
was sent to the ED and taken to the cath lab, where he was found 
to have 98% occlusion of OM2 which is now s/p DES. He had 
recurrent chest pain 1hr 20min after cath, and was taken back to 
the cath lab, but there was no evidence of new thrombosis.  He 
also had low grade fevers, and hypoxemia, with negative PE on 
CAT scan but bilateral LL consolidations, concerning for 
pneumonia, with productive sputum, and was started on abx 
(ceftriaxone ___ then on levaquin since ___- ). TTE on day of 
cath ___ showed LVEF 58%, hypokinetic basal inferolateral wall, 
but no pericardial effusions, but on day of transfer ___ repeat 
echo showed moderate pericardial effusion with early signs of 
tamponade, normal LVEF and was HDS. 

Vitals on transfer were T36.8 82 124/89 18 97% 2L NC, then 
98-100%RA.  On arrival he was in no acute distress, HDS, 
complaining of subjective SOB without chest pain.  Complained of 
R sided HA, and R shoulder pain ___ without other neurologic 
symptoms.  
 
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS  
ROS otherwise positive for productive cough x 3 days, which has 
been improving, generalized discomfort sinus/bilateral ear 
congestion, and frequent hiccups. 
On review of systems, he denies any prior history of stroke, 
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the 
time of surgery, myalgias,  hemoptysis, black stools or red 
stools. He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors, no weight 
loss, joint pains or rash. All of the other review of systems 
were negative.  
 
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain, 
paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema, 
palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

ACTIVE ISSUES
# Acute pericardial effusion:  
Patient was found to have new pericardial effusion, which had 
not initially been seen on TTE on day of PCI ___, but with 
small effusion initially noted on CT chest ___.  However, on 
review of prior EKGs from ___, patient had diffuse ST elevation 
and PR depressions, concerning for pericarditis.  On day of 
transfer, patient had been noted to have repeat TTE with 
moderate pericardial effusion with early signs of tamponade.  
His LVEF was normal and he was HDS, with pulsus ranging from 
___. Repeat TTE was unchanged, and his pulsus remained stable.  
He had been started on colchicine at ___ which was continued.  
Given stable effusion, and no hemodynamic compromise, there was 
no need for drainage.  Pulsus decreased to 7, and he was 
eventually stable for the ___ medicine floor. On the floor 
his pulsus was ___, and at no point did he have dyspnea or 
further elevation of his JVP.  He was discharged on colchicine 
0.6 mg BID and aspirin 81 mg daily. The etiology of his 
pericarditis and pericardial effusion is unclear, and could be 
idiopathic. Alternative explanations include part of autoimmune 
process ___ from ___ pending at time of discharge) or 
Dressler's syndrome in setting of previous MI from OM2 occlusion 
causing TTE findings 
 
# Elevated LFTs:  
Elevated alk phos, with direct hyperbili, and mildly elevated 
AST/ALT. GGT was elevated, although patient stated only having 
"a couple" wine/beer per week.  He had mild discomfort to RUQ 
palpation, but RUQ US was unremarkable, hepatitis serologies 
were negative.  Tbili trended up during hospitalization and 
hepatology was consulted.  ___ showed no evidence of 
obstruction. Antibody tests for autoimmune hepatitis 
(anti-smooth muscle antibody) and primary biliary cirrhosis 
(anti-mitochondrial antibody) were negative. HIV-1 antibody was 
negative. tTG-IgA was within normal limits. Tbili began to trend 
downwards, and further work-up was deferred to outpatient 
setting. He will by contacted by hepatology here at ___ for a 
follow-up appointment within two weeks, and was discharged with 
instructions to have liver labs drawn prior to follow-up. 

# CAD:  
Had DES placed in OM2 for 98% occlusion.  Was continued on 
atorvastatin, metop, brilinta.  No new EKG changes other than 
continued diffuse ST elevation for pericardititis. Pt was 
subsequently switched from atorvastatin to pravastatin (which pt 
was previously prescribed) and on brillinta with close follow-up 
with his outpatient cardiologist.

# Epigastric/Chest pain: 
Non-cardiac. Likely secondary to known GERD, he is s/p ___ 
fundoplication (___) for hiatal hernia.  At ___, he underwent 
cath, found to have 98% occlusion of OM2, s/p DES.  He continued 
to have CP, had repeat cath on the same day with patent stent 
and no other lesions.  He continued to have epigastric and 
R-sided chest pain, with no EKG or TTE changes, and TTP over his 
epigastrum and RUQ.  Pt reported a h/o constipation and was 
placed on a GI cocktail with an aggressive bowel regimen PRN. 
Over the course of several days, his epigastric pain improved 
and he was able to eat without difficulty. He was discharged on 
his home GERD regimen.

# Diarrhea: 
On ___ pt reported several episodes of diarrhea with 
preceding abdominal pain after eating. Unclear etiology with pt 
on aggressive bowel regimen, taking colchicine and brief course 
of abx (levofloxacin).  C. diff stool negative. Most likely due 
to colchicine.

# SOB: 
Subjective SOB without any desaturations on RA and HDS and no PE 
on CT.  Possibly secondary to recent PNA seen on CT at OSH, 
which was resolving clinically and lungs clear on exam.  He was 
continued on levofloxacin for CAP 5 day course (___). 
After completing levofloxacin, he had no further complaints of 
SOB. 

CHRONIC ISSUES
# Depression: 
Pt has h/o depression and was continued on bupropion.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,

You were hospitalized for chest pain with concern for a heart 
attack. You were found at ___ to have a 
blockage in one of the blood vessels that supplies the heart, 
and a stent was placed to keep it open. You were also found to 
have inflammation of the lining around your heart as well as 
fluid within that lining (pericardial effusion). You were 
transferred to ___ over concern that the fluid was limiting 
your heart function. Here at ___ the fluid around your heart 
was stable and did not worsen. You are being treated for this 
inflammation with aspirin and colchicine, which you should 
continue taking for 6 months.  It is also extremely important 
that you take your TiCAGRELOR twice a day for at least the next 
year!! 

Your other major issue while you were here were elevations in 
liver enzymes (transaminases) as well as your bilirubin (direct 
bilirubinemia) and alkaline phosphatase. These lab values were 
concerning and we evaluated this with MR imaging (___). The 
___ was felt to be a normal study. As your bilirubin was 
improving, and you were doing well overall with tolerating food 
and having no difficulty breathing, you were able to go home. 
You will have an appointment with our liver doctors here at 
___ in the next few weeks, they will call you with an 
appointment. You should have your primary care doctor, ___. 
___ the following tests: AST(SGOT), ALT (SGPT), 
GGT, Alkaline Phosphatase, Total Bilirubin, Direct Bilirubin. 
You should get a copy of the results and also have your doctor 
fax them to the ___ liver clinic (to get the fax number call 
the liver clinic at ___ and ask for the fax number). 
You should also bring a copy of the results to your next 
appointment.

If you are to experience difficulty breathing, chest pain like 
something sitting your chest, or severe abdominal pain on the 
right side that is different from your reflux pain, please call 
your doctor or go to the emergency department. 

 
Followup Instructions:
___
