___ year old Male transferred from ___ ___, with 
complaints of fever to 102.3, diahrea in refractory crohn's 
disease flare. The patient was diagnosed with crohn's disease 
___, and was started on 3 weeks of TPN, given steroid, which 
did not work. He notes that with the initial crohn's flare he 
lost 50 pounds, although with the TPN he gained back 15. He also 
notes that his prior hypertension resolved with the weight loss.

Ultimately he was started on remicade, which was complicated by 
a prior + PPD which was not completely treated with INH due to 
elevated LFT's. The decision was made that even though a PPD 
currently was negative that this could have been masked with 
steroids, so he is on INH and remicade. He recieved 2 infusions 
on ___ and ___ with no relief. The pateint reports 
that he has had 5 days of chills, fevers, apthous ulcers and 
diarhea. He presented to the ___ with dehydration and was

Successful placement of 8 ___ pigtail catheter in a right 
lower quadrant collection. The catheter should be routinely 
flushed as per the post-procedure recommendations, to ensure 
adequate drainage. Sample of 
fluid sent for microbiology analysis. Short interval follow up 
with CT will likely be required to assess response to the 
current catheter placement and to determine if separate 
approaches to additional loculations will ultimately be 
necessary. 

CT FISTULOGRAM S&I ___: Appropriate positioning of a drain 
with collapsed primary loculation in the right lower quadrant 
with small residual loculations at sites described above. 
Abscessogram showing intercommunication among all loculations of 
the collection as well as free passaged into the rectal pouch.

including Oxycodone/Tylenol on admission without issue. The 
patient remained neurologically intact and without change from 
baseline. The patient remained alert and oriented to person, 
location and place. His home Fluoxetine was continued.

CARDIOVASCULAR: The patient remained hemodynamically stable upon 
admission, although he was notably experiencing sinus 
tachycardia intermittently throughout his stay. This was 
attributed to his fevers and intra-abdominal fluid collections. 
This resolved with antibiotics, hydration and conservative 
management. Vitals signs were closely monitored throughout his 
stay.

RESPIRATORY: The patient had no episodes of desaturation or 
pulmonary concerns. The patient denied cough or respiratory 
symptoms. Pulse oximetry was monitored closely and the patient 
maintained adequate oxygenations.  

GASTROINTESTINAL: The patient had a diagnosis of

abscesses. Upon transfer to ___, on ___, the patient 
underwent CT-guided drainage with ___ resulting in successful 
placement of 8 ___ pigtail catheter in a right lower quadrant 
collection. The catheter was routinely flushed as per the 
post-procedure recommendations, to ensure adequate drainage. 
Sample of fluid was sent for microbiology analysis. The patient 
was treated with antibiotics in-hospital and upon discharge. The 
patient was initially NPO on maintenance IV fluids for the 
procedure, but was otherwise tolerating a regular diet without 
issue. He did have some high ostomy output on ___ which 
resolved with Loperamide. He was also started on Prednisone PO 
on admission and steroids were continued upon discharge. A 
fistulogram on ___ confirmed appropriate positioning of the 
drain with collapsed primary loculation in the right lower 
quadrant with small residual loculations at other sites. 
Abscessogram showing intercommunication among all loculations of 
the  collection as well as free passaged into the rectal pouch. 
Thickening of the visualized pouch concerning for ongoing 
inflammation was noted. The patient was to continue regular 
diet, steroids, and complete antibiotics upon discharge.

GENITOURINARY: The patient's urine output was closely monitored. 
A Foley catheter was not required, the patient voided without 
issue. The patient's intake and output was closely monitored for 
> 30 mL per hour output. The patient's creatinine was 0.9. 

HEME: The patient's hematocrit remained stable during his 
admission. The patient remained hemodynamically stable and did 
not require transfusion. The patient's coagulation profile 
remained normal. The patient had no evidence of bleeding.

ID: The patient's initial abscess culture gram stain was 
significant for gram positive cocci and thus IV Vancomycin and 
Zosyn (which had been initiated on admission) were continued. 
This was transitioned to PO Augmentin was by ___. His 
fevers, which had been noted on admission, had resolved with 
antibiotic treatment. The patient was transitioned to IV 
Ceftriaxone on HOD#7 when speciation of his abscess cultures 
revealed Streptococcus anginosus x 2 morphologies. ID 
recommended the IV antibiotics and a PICC line was placed for 
planned completion of a 4-week course at home with nursing 
services. Infectious disease was consulted on ___ for 
assistance with antibiotic management and agreed with the 
discharge regimen.

ENDOCRINE: The patient's blood glucose was closely monitored. 
Blood glucose levels greater than 120 mg/dL were addressed with 
an insulin sliding scale.

PROPHYLAXIS: The patient was maintained on heparin 5000 units SQ 
TID for DVT/PE prophylaxis and encouraged to ambulate. The 
patient also had sequential compression boot devices in place 
during immobilization to promote circulation. The patient was 
encouraged to utilize incentive spirometry, ambulate early and 
was discharged in stable condition.

Brief Hospital Course:
Hospital Course: ___ male with past medical history of 
recently diagnosed Crohns disease refractory to TNF/steroid 
agents with recent discharge on ___ following 
hospitalization for Crohns flare with past medical history 
significant for GERD, diverticulosis, nephrolithiasis who 
presented with fever, left lower quadrant abdominal pain, and 
diarrhea for the last three days consistent with recurrent 
Crohns flare based on imaging complicated by probable CMV 
colitis. 

# Crohns Flare with CMV colitis:
Patient was diagnosed with Crohn's disease in ___ ___omplicated by TPN requirement secondary to ___ weight loss 
and failure of steroid therapy. He was subsequently started on 
remicade, which was complicated by the fact of a prior positive 
PPD with incomplete treatment with INH due to elevated LFTs in 
the remote past. He had no response to remicade. He subsequently 
presented in ___ with another Crohn's flare complicated 
by ___ anemia with sigmoidoscopy on ___ 
revealing discrete large colonic ulcers with biopsy showing 
severely active colitis with ulceration with no granulomata or 
dysplasia idenitifed and negative CMV stains. Infection ___ 
in the setting of fever during hospitalization was negative and 
he was empirically treated with a ___ course of flagyl and 
ciprofloxacin. He was started on cyclosporine and cortefoam 
enemas.

For this hospitalization, he presented with fever (102 per home 
measurement), ___ of LLQ crampy abdominal pain, and 
worsening ___ watery diarrhea after finishing his ___ 
course of cipro/flagyl from his last hospitalization. Abdominal 
CT/pelvis and sigmoidoscopy was consistent with Crohns flare; 
however, given immunosuppresion and fever, there was a concern 
for an infectious process such as C. difficile colitis, CMV 
infection, or other infectious colitis in setting of recent 
hospitalization, antibiotic therapy, and immunosuppresion. He 
was started on cipro/flagyl again with pathology from flex sig 
showing possible CMV colitis though CMV PCR was negative. The 
patient spiked fevers throughout his hospitalization, likely 
secondary to underlying colitis and inflammation with negative 
infection ___ and negative repeat abdominal CT looking for 
abscess, perforation, or worsening colitis.

The patient's course was discussed with Dr. ___ set the 
parameters of the patient being afebrile for 24 hours with BM<5 
for 24 hours for discharge. He did not improve with Cyclosporine 
and so on ___, GI recommendations from Dr. ___: 
Cyclosporine and INH were discontinued and steroids and MTX were 
started.

At this point the patient was transferred to the ___, as 
he preferred not to be on a teaching service. 

Various ID tests were checked on ___ on ___ with 
the following results: HIV and hepatitis serologies negative.

At discharge, he was continued on Prednisone taper starting at 
60mg daily, IV Ganciclovir x3 weeks (PICC placed) followed by PO 
Valganciclovir for 3 months. He will be followed by a ___. Mr. 
___ completed a ___ course of Cipro and Flagyl in the 
hospital.

He should continue isoniazid and pyridoxine for 9 months (start 
___ given hx latent TB in the context of recent remicade use.  
During the hospitalization, he may have developed a fever from 
isoniazid so it was recommended that he temporarily stop using 
it.  Infectious disease will decide in ___ clinic whether 
or not to restart it.

He will require extensive followup as follows: 
- GI followup with Dr. ___
- ID followup, with weekly labs faxed to ___ clinic by the ___ to 
monitor for ganciclovir side effects.
- PCP followup
- ___ followup for CMV retinitis- patient given phone number 
to make appointment

Of note, the patient had low values of Magnesium and Potassium 
secondary to diarrhea and required supplementation.  Diarrhea 
slowly improved, so his Potassium level did not require 
supplementation at the end of hospitalization.  Magnesium 
supplementation was continued at the time of discharge.

# Coagulopathy: The patient's INR rose slightly during his stay, 
from 1.2 to 1.6, likely secondary to malnutrition. With improved 
PO intake, the INR decreased to 1.3

# Normocytic anemia:
The patient's Hct was within its normal fluctuating baseline 
with no appreciable acute blood loss during hospitalization. 
Etiology is likely multifactorial from systemic inflammation 
from underlying chronic inflammation/Crohns and possible drug 
side effect with cyclosporine. He was continued on home ferrous 
sulfate. He required no transfusions during hospitalization. 

# Depression
Differential includes depression vs. adjustment disorder vs. 
secondary to drug side effect given recent diagnosis of IBD, 
multiple hospitalizations, and cyclosporine. Patient's affect 
initially constricted and depressed. After patient education 
about illness, more expansive with hope with periods of sadness. 
He denied SI/HI throughout hospitalization. He was continued on 
fluoxetine.

# Presumed Latent TB:
See above discussion in Crohns section about PPD history and 
rationale for current treatment. Isoniazid was discontinued on 
___ as it was thought that it caused a drug fever.  
Pyridoxine continued.  It will be decided in ___ clinic ___ 
when and if he will be restarted on Isoniazid.

# GERD:
He was continued on omeprazole 

# Hypertension
The patient's beta blocker (atenolol) had been discontinued 
during his hospitalizations. It was restarted at a reduced dose 
(originally 50 mg daily was decreased to 25 mg daily) given 
concern for low blood pressure with ongoing fluid loss in 
diarrhea. Was restarted during this hospitalization given 
elevated SBP and patient preference. 

# Shoulder pain
The patient developed shoulder pain during his hospitalization 
that was musculoskeletal on exam. Patient was treated with 
Flexeril with good result.
