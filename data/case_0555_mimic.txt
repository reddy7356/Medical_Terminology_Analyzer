History of Present Illness:
 ___ year old woman with a complex
medical history including HTN, CAD, HLD, paroxysmal AF,
hemorrhagic stroke, and cadaveric renal transplant ___ who
presents from SNF with dark urine and R flank tenderness for 3
days. 

Pt developed acute onset R flank tenderness over the past 3D,
which she associates with prior urinary tract infections. She 
did
not take any medications to help with the pain, the pain 
radiated
to her groin, not to her back. Day PTA she noted dark urine,
normally her urine is yellow. 

The patient endorses decreased PO intake over the past 4 days
because she dislikes the food at her nursing facility. She tries
to supplement her diet with fresh fruit, cereal, hummus, and
vitamins, which she considers healthier than the offerings at 
her
nursing home. She denies dysuria or polyuria. She denies pain
over her abdomen. She denies fevers, chill, or rigors. She 
denies
nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea. 

She was most recently admitted to the ___ on ___ for
abdominal pain and was found to have a UTI (E. coli and
Klebsiella) sensitive to PO ciprofloxacin. 

In the ED, initial vital signs were: 98.1 70 127/79 16 97%RA 

Exam notable for: tenderness over R flank 

Labs were notable for: Cr 2.0 (elevated from baseline of 1.3),
BUN 44, HCO3 20. UA showed 2 epithelial cells, 14 WBCs, 30
proteins, negative nitrites, negative blood, negative glucose,
and negative ketones. 

Studies performed include: renal ultrasound showing no interval
changes from ___

Patient was given: 1L NS

Consults: Renal transplant, recommended admission to Medicine,
urine protein/Cr ratio, and urine BK virus PCR.   

Vitals on transfer:  98 81 131/88 18 100%RA

Upon arrival to the floor, the patient was hemodynamically 
stable
and denied fever, or dysuria. She endorsed band-like pain around
her lower ribs, which was improved since her prior admission for
costochondritis, as well as chronic pain at her coccyx, spine,
and soles of her feet, which was at her baseline. 

She endorses a desire to transition herself to hospice care due
to her dissatisfaction with her living situation and struggles
with chronic pain; she has discussed this with multiple
psychiatrists as well as with her kidney transplant doctor, who
are among her closest relationships. She feels that she does not
have anyone who she can talk to at her nursing home, as many of
them have advanced dementia or are much older. 
 
Review of Systems:  
(+) per HPI.  endorses frequent migraine headaches, at her
baseline. 
(-) fever, chills, night sweats, headache, vision changes,
rhinorrhea, congestion, sore throat, cough, shortness of breath,

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ is a ___ with a PMHx of CAD, HTN, HLD, diastolic 
heart failure, ESRD s/p DDRT in ___ (baseline Cr 1.3), chronic 
pain, recurrent UTIs, and depression presents with 3 days of 
flank tenderness in the setting of poor PO intake found to have 
___ on CKD (Cr 2.0 from baseline 1.3). Creatinine improved with 
fluids and no organisms grew on urine culture.

ACUTE/ACTIVE PROBLEMS:
======================
# ___ on CKD: Cr 2.0 up from baseline of 1.3 in setting of poor 
PO intake likely pre-renal ___ secondary to hypovolemia. Renal 
ultrasound was negative for hydronephrosis. Cr improved with 
fluids. BK virus PCR < 500 on discharge, and urine culture was 
without any dominant organisms. 

# Flank tenderness: 
# Groin Pain. Patient has history of flank tenderness associated 
with recurrent UTIs. Location of renal transplant not consistent 
with location of pain. Unclear etiology at this time, although 
pain may be consistent with hip osteoarthritis as pain is in 
lower R side of back with radiation to R groin. Urine culture 
was negative, and transplant ultrasound without any evidence of 
renal fat stranding. 
 Pain chronic in nature. If pain persists or worsens, may 
benefit from hip XR as outpatient.

# H/o depression: Patient reported that mood has improved since 
last year and that she no longer requires an anti-depressant. 
Has discussed option for hospice care with multiple providers, 
and feels comforted by the availability of this option, but 
would still like to talk with son ___ and ___. No 
active SI, HI, or paranoia. Patient will follow up with 
palliative care as outpatient for symptomatic management and 
further discussions on this subject.

# Chronic pain: 
Due to persistently uncontrolled musculoskeletal pain as a 
driver for her desire to enter hospice care even though she is 
not actively dying, her fentanyl patch was uptitrated from 75 
mcg q72h to 100 mcg q72h, as she was tolerating the former dose 
without any evidence of sedation and with inadequate symptom 
control.

CHRONIC/STABLE PROBLEMS:
========================
# Hypothyroidism:
Continued home levothyroxine 88 mcg QD

# Renal Transplant:
Continued home tacrolimus 0.5/0.5, prednisone 10 mg QD, 
calcitriol 0.25 mcg BID. 

# Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation: Not on home anti-coagulation
Continued home metoprolol succinate 25 mg PO QD 

# CAD/HLD:
Continued home ASA 81 QD, rosuvastatin 40mg QD 

# H/o duodenal polyps: Last seen by ___ in ___. Declining 
repeat EGD or other procedures. 
Continued home omeprazole 40mg BID, dicyclomine 10mg PO TID 

# H/o panic attacks:
Continued home clonazepam 0.5 mg PO BID 

# H/o herpes zoster:
Continued home acyclovir 200 mg PO QD 

# Nutrition
Continued home vitamins 

Transitional Issues:

to chronic thrombus within R superficial femoral vein. Had been
off AC on admission due to history of hemorrhagic stroke; 
resumed
apixaban based on DVT. Loaded with apixaban 10MG BID for 1 week, 
ongoing at time of discharge, should be transitioned to apixaban 
5MG BID on ___.

# Adrenal Insufficiency
# Hypoglycemia
# Hyperkalemia
Patient on chronic steroids for renal transplant. This admission
had hypoglycemia, hyponatremia, hyperkalemia concerning for 
adrenal insufficiency in setting of physiologic stress, i.e. 
infection (UTI). AM Cortisol low at 1.8. Cortisol 1.3->6.2 with 
cosyntropin test suggestive of adrenal insufficiency. 
Hyperkalemia was transient and resolved with dietary changes. 
Evaluated by endocrinology with diagnosis of primary adrenal 
insufficiency in the setting of adrenal atrophy from chronic 
prednisone use. No concern for other causes of primary adrenal 
insufficiency given intact mineralocorticoid activity based on 
labs with only transient hyperK. Per endocrinology "patient to 
take double steroid dose for two days if she feel sick or has a 
cold. Furthermore told to triple dose for three days if very 
ill. Will require stress dose
steroids under periods of increased stress (eg infection,
surgery)" Per endocrine, "pt to receive Solu-cortef 100mg 1 vial 
IM
prescription (ACT-O-VIAL)at discharge with rx for BD ___
Syringe 3ml 23 gauge. Pt instructed to use in emergency to
prevent adrenal crisis."

# Access
# PICC Site Bleeding
Access difficult to obtain, patient refused attempted lab draws. 
PICC placed for access and hydration on ___. Removed PICC on 
___ due to persistent bleeding from site. Given INR 1.8 (higher 
than would anticipate on apixaban) in setting of malnutrition 
and prolonged poor PO intake, possible nutritional component of 
coagulopathy contributing to bleeding, dosed PO vitamin K. INR 
1.8->1.7 with vitamin K, re-dosed on ___. Bleeding stabilized 
prior to discharge, hemoglobin remaining stable. Note mild 
hypofibrinogenemia (180s, then 205 on discharge, without any 
FFP/cryo). 

# Malnutrition
# Hypoalbuminemia
# Poor PO intake
Albumin 2.5 on arrival with mild proteinuria. ___ swelling likely
due primarily to DVT, but may also be some element of
hypoalbuminemia contributing. Poor PO intake due to patient's
dietary restrictions and preferences. Continued nutritional 
supplementation as per inpatient nutrition recs.

# ___
# ESRD s/p DDRT in ___.
Baseline Cr 1.0 - 1.5 in ___. She had severe scarring on
biopsy in ___. Cr 1.7 on presentation, improved to 1.0 with 
fluids.
Transplant US unremarkable. Likely mild pre-renal given
improvement with IV fluids. Tacro Trough goal ___. Continued 
Tacrolimus 0.5mg BID, checked daily levels while inpatient. 
Continued prednisone 5mg daily, acyclovir 400mg BID. Followed by 
transplant nephrology while admitted, will continue outpatient 
follow-up.

CHRONIC ISSUES:
===============

IMAGING: 

___ EXAMINATION: CHEST (AP AND LATERAL) INDICATION: History: 
___ with ESRD status post renal transplant now with right flank 
and back pain for 1 week and positive urinalysis TECHNIQUE: 
Upright AP and lateral views of the chest COMPARISON: ___ FINDINGS: Heart size remains mildly enlarged. The aorta is 
diffusely calcified and tortuous. Mediastinal and hilar contours 
are relatively unchanged. Low lung volumes cause crowding of the 
bronchovascular structures without overt pulmonary edema. No 
focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is 
present. Mild atelectasis is noted in the lung bases. 
Degenerative changes are again seen in the thoracic spine. 
IMPRESSION: No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality. 

// EXAMINATION: RENAL TRANSPLANT U.S. INDICATION: ___ year old 
woman with right lower quadrant renal transplant in ___, now 
with tenderness to palpation over transplant site TECHNIQUE: 
Grey scale as well as color and spectral Doppler ultrasound 
images of the renal transplant were obtained. COMPARISON: Renal 
transplant ultrasound ___. FINDINGS: The right 
iliac fossa transplant renal morphology is normal. Specifically, 
the cortex is of normal thickness and echogenicity, and the 
medullary pyramids are normal. There is no urothelial 
thickening, and renal sinus fat is normal. A right upper pole 
simple cyst measuring 4.8 x 4.9 cm is relatively unchanged since 
___. There is no hydronephrosis and no perinephric 
fluid collection. The resistive index of intrarenal arteries 
ranges from 0.68 to 0.72, within the normal range. The resistive 
indices measured in ___ range from 0.64 to 0.7. The 
main renal artery shows a normal waveform, with prompt systolic 
upstroke and continuous antegrade diastolic flow, with peak 
systolic velocity of 40.1 cm/sec. Vascularity is symmetric 
throughout transplant. The transplant renal vein is patent and 
shows normal waveform. IMPRESSION: Unremarkable renal transplant 
ultrasound. Right upper pole simple renal cyst. / 

___ EXAMINATION: CHEST (PORTABLE AP) INDICATION: ___ year old 
woman with /pyelo /now hypoxia // interval change interval 
change IMPRESSION: In comparison with the study of ___, 
allowing for the portable AP study, there is probably little 
change in the appearance of the cardiomediastinal silhouette. 
The left hemidiaphragm is not sharply seen, consistent with 
volume loss at the left base with small pleural effusion. The 
right lung is essentially clear and there is no definite 
elevation pulmonary venous pressure.

presents malaise and RLQ abd pain and back pain with nausea and 
vomiting diagnosed with transplant pyelnonephritis, sensitive to 
cipro hospitral course complicated by hopspital delerium. 

ACTIVE MEDICAL ISSUES:  
#Transplant pyelonephritis: Pt presented to the ED with several 
days of malaise, RLQ abd pain and nausea and vomiting found to 
have UA with pyuria concerning for complicated UTI/ 
pyelnephritis. Patient was found to meet ___ SIRS criteria with 
tachycardia and ___. CBC without WBC count but this may be due 
to chronic immunosupression. Lactate was reassuring. Renal US 
with " Unremarkable renal transplant ultrasound" Urine culture 
found to grow klebsiella sensitive to cipro. Patient treated 
with 14 day course of ciprofloxacin (___) 

#AMS: Throughout this hospitalization patient found to have 
waxing and waning mental status and to be very lethargic likely 
secondary to hospital delerium and oversedation from home 
clonazepam and oxycontin. On day 1 of admission patient 
triggered for AMS as she was only responsive to sternal rub. ABG 
found her to have respiratory acidosis thought to be in the 
setting of likely hypoventilation from home doses of klonipin 
and oxycontin. Patient recovered her MS ___ intervention.  
Patients ongoing waxing and waning delerium thought to be a 
combination of hospital delerium with contribution from infecion 
and constipation likely secondary to chronic narcotics. She was 
also found to be retaining urine after foley removal. Neuro exam 
non focal. Treated with seroquel qhs while admitted. On the day 
of discharge patient had returned to her baseline mental status 
and was urinating spontaneously. 

# Anion gap metabolic acidosis- Pateint presented with anion gap 
metabolic acidosis of uncertain etiology. Lactate not elevated. 
This may be explained by ketones in urine from poor PO intake 
leading to physiologic fasting state. Resolved on discharge. 

___ on CKD: Cr 3.2 on admission. Most recent Cr on 2.3 on 
___ but on review ___ records Cr was 1.4 in ___. ___ likely pre-renal in setting of poor PO intake and 
malaise. Cr trended on discharge to 1.8. She was toleraying and 
taking PO. 
 
#Hematomas on shins: Patient found to have hematomas on 
bilateral shins. She reported these were from bumping up against 
her wheelchair. They were tender but did not appear acutely 
infected on exam. 

CHRONIC MEDICAL ISSUES:  
# ESRD ___ to chronic reflux nephropathy s/p cadaveric renal 
transplant in ___ . Tacro level was found to be elevated to 13. 
Her dose was decreased to 1.5mg daily
She was continued on PredniSONE 20 mg PO/NG DAILY and 
prophylaxis with acyclovir.
 
# Hyperphosphatemia ___ metabolic bone disease. Phos 4.7 on 
admission, which is improved from previous discharge phos of 
5.0. She was not on a phosphate binder. Phos on discharge was 
1.4. She shoudl have her phosphate monitored as an outpatient. 

#hypothyroidism:  stable. She was continued on home 
Levothyroxine Sodium 125 mcg
  
#anxiety:  clonazepam was discontinued due to AMS 

#HL: continued home statin 
 
#GERD: continued home omeprazole, NO ranitidine given h/o AIN 
 
#chronic pain: ___ OA long acting opiods discontinued due to 
episode of AMS, pain controled with tyelenol and low dose 
tramadol, Voltaren *NF* (diclofenac sodium) 1 % topical daily 
 
#Code: Full (confirmed) 
# 
Transitional Issues:

though review ___ records Cr of 1.2 in ___. 
Please continue to monitor creatinine closely on discharge.
- Last dose of cipro ___.
- She had urinary retention while here requiring intermittent 
catheterization. This may be from the urinary infection, but if 
recurrent, would conisder urodynamic studies or evaluation for 
pelvic organ prolapse. 
- Tacrolimus decreased to 1.5 mg QAM. Second dose of 0.5mg was 
discontinued as trough levels were elevated. 
- She needs labs checked in one week on ___ (BMP, tacrolimus 
trough) and faxed to the ___ transplant clinic at ___
attn Dr. ___. 
-Patients phosphate was 1.4 on discharge.  She should have

OTHER SELECTED RESULTS:
=====================
___ 05:52AM BLOOD tacroFK-13.___ year old woman with a PMH significant for HTN, HLD, CAD, 
paroxysmal afib, hemorrhagic stroke, renal transplant in ___ on 
tacrolimus, diverticulosis, recurrent UTIs, and chronic back 
pain who presented from her facility with altered mental status 
and a leg wound, found to have UTI, transferred to MICU for 
management of refractory afib with RVR with hypotension, now 
stable on the floor.

ACUTE ISSUES:
==============
#Acute complicated UTI
#Pyuria, Bacturia, fever
Presented with pyuria, bacteria and fever/AMS with hx recurrent 
UTIs. Initially treated empirically with meropenem. Cultures on 
___ showing a moderately sensitive E coli. Narrowed to CTX, 
then to po Cefpodoxime for total 14 day course per renal 
recommendation (___).

#toxic metabolic encephalopathy
#agitation
Patient presented from her facility altered from her baseline. 
This was though to be due to ongoing UTI. Affect and behavior 
remained abnormal, with agitation and paranoia. Psychiatry was 
consulted for recommendations on agitation management. 
Olanzapine qhs was used. She also continued her outpatient 
duloxetine (with intermittent refusal). Psychiatry recommended 
continuation of the olanzapine for 1 week, with follow-up at 
that time to assess whether she should remain on it going 
forward. She remains alternatingly verbally combative and 
sycophantic. Per her facility staff and her outpatient 
nephrologist, she is at baseline.

# Afib w RVR
___ has known A fib, rate controlled on metoprolol. She is not 
on anti-coagulation at home despite CHADS2VASC 4. During this 
admission, she went in to Afib with RVR. Cardioversion was not 
an option given not anti-coagulated. On ___, the patient 
reported chest pain and EKG showed atrial fibrillation with RVR 
and rates to the 170s. The patient received metoprolol IV ×2 
with no effect, and then was given diltiazem with rates down to 
the ___ and hypoxia requiring nonrebreather as well as 
hypotension. The patient was transferred to the ICU for further 
management. Trigger for afib w/ rvr suspected to be beta blocker 
withdrawal, infection, and dehydration. Suspect that transient 
hypotension was related to large dose of diltiazem and 
dehydration, blood pressures had subsequently improved to the 
100s systolic on arrival to the ICU. Metoprolol was started at 
6.25mg q6h and was consolidated to 25mg succinate daily for 
discharge. 

#Bilateral leg wound
#bruises on arms
Presented after trauma to left lower extremity several weeks 
ago. Per records, was receiving wound care at her facility. No 
evidence of cellulitis on exam. Due to agitation and kicking at 
staff in ED, developed right lower extremity skin tear and 
bruises on arms. Patient initially claimed that she was abused 
in the ED but upon speaking with her further she acknowledges 
that this was not due to abuse but occurred as she was fighting 
against staff attempting to draw blood for medical necessity. 

# CKD s/p renal transplant
___ has a history of renal transplant in ___ for nephropathy 
secondary to chronic GU reflux disease. Baseline creatinine 
appears to be 1.2-1.3 since ___. Her tacrolimus was 
supratherapeutic on admission so her dosing was changed to 0.5mg 
BID, for a goal level of ___. She was continued on home 
prednisone dose.

CHRONIC ISSUES: 
===============
# Chronic back pain
Continued home APAP 1g q8h. Fentanyl held on admission iso 
altered mental status. Oxycodone
5mg q4h prn to prevent withdrawal. Tizanidine was also held. 
Will restart these medications upon d/c.

# CAD/HLD
Continued home aspirin and rosuvastatin 

# Hypothyroidism
Continued home levothyroxine 88mcg daily

# H/o duodenal polyps 
Last seen by ___ in ___. Continued home omeprazole, 
dicyclomine and sucralfate.

Held home clonazepam.

# H/o herpes zoster 
Continued home acyclovir 

# Nutrition
Continued home vitamins 

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
==================
[] Check tacrolimus level within 1 week of discharge. Result 
should be communicated to outpatient nephrologist Dr. ___ at 
___ (if done in BI system he will have access to lab results) 

___
___

[] Cefpodoxime should be continued for total 14 day course 
(through ___.
[] Zolpidem held given risk of confusion; carefully consider 
restarting if needed.
[] Trial olanzapine for one week on return to rehab. After 1 
week ___ MD or ___ MD or NP should reassess and 
discontinue if no clear benefit given risk of side effects. 
[] Not currently on anticoagulation. Given A Fib with 
CHADs2-VAsc of 4, may benefit from anticoagulation. Consider in 
context of overall risks and benefits.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ is a ___ year old man with h/o history of HTN, HLD, 
CAD, paroxysmal afib, hemorrhagic stroke, renal transplant in 
___ on tacrolimus, diverticulosis, c. diff, UTIs, chronic back 
pain and wheelchair bound at baseline who presents for abdominal 
pain.

#Abdominal pain
The patient reports 1 week of sharp, non-radiating L-sided 
abdominal pain without any other associated symptoms. 
Atraumatic. Afebrile, HDS, well-appearing. Abdominal exam 
benign, neurological exam unchanged from baseline, no rash or 
skin changes. Non-con CT C/A/P unremarkable. UA with pyuria, but 
likely chronic colonization. Renal US of transplanted kidney 
unremarkable. Unlikely to be related to UTI; bilateral CVAT more 
likely related to MSK pain, esp. since she is s/p R nephrectomy. 
Unlikely to be new compression fracture given no step-offs. No 
s/sx of cord compression or cauda equina syndrome. The 
description of the pain was not consistent with shingles 
(non-dermatomal). The description of the pain was felt to be 
most consistent with musculoskeletal in etiology. The chronic 
pain service was consulted, and recommended lidocaine ointment, 
lidocaine 5% patch, uptitration of ___ home tizanidine dose, 
TENS unit to the L abdomen, and continuation of ___ home APAP 
and fentanyl patch. They recommended as well that she continue 
with ___ that is in-house in ___ SNF; the patient refused an 
in-house ___ evaluation. Pain was improved prior to discharge.

#Depression
#H/o panic attacks
The patient endorsed depressed mood and reports that primary 
life stressor is dissatisfaction with current living situation 
at ___. She is NOT on hospice, however has considered 
in the past. She likely would not meet criteria. She denied any 
SI/HI. Per SW, we were unable to change SNF placement during 
this admission, but could initiate process as outpatient. The 
patient's home duloxetine and clonazepam were continued.

___
Creatinine on admission 1.5 from a baseline of 1.3, uptrending 
to 1.6 on ___. The patient reports adequate PO and fluid 
intake, but feeling thirsty. Renal US w/out e/o hydronephrosis. 
She was given IVF but ___ Cr remained stable at 1.5. She denied 
taking NSAIDs. Other medication-related causes were considered 
(omeprazole, acyclovir) but felt unlikely. Tacrolimus toxicity 
was also considered; a tacrolimus level was within normal limits 
and no adjustment to the dose was made. ___ renal function was 
discussed with the renal transplant team, who felt that the Cr 
level is relatively stable from baseline and a mild elevation 
could represent fibrotic changes (seen previously on biopsy in 
___. They did not recommend any further intervention. Adequate 
oral fluid intake was encouraged. 

# CKD s/p renal transplant and R nephrectomy 
Renal US of transplanted kidney unremarkable. As above, no 
changes were made to home tacrolimus and prednisone. Home 
calcitriol was continued as well.

#Pyuria
Patient with history of MDR UTIs. Previous cultures grew 
Morganella morganii. In the setting of abdominal pain, a 
urinalysis was obtained which showed pyuria and large leukocyte 
esterase. However, she has no other infectious symptoms such as 
leukocytosis, fever, or dysuria, so no antibiotics were 
administered.

# CAD/HLD - Home aspirin and rosuvastatin were continued.

# Hypothyroidism - Last TSH 0.47 on ___. Home levothyroxine 
88 mcg QD were continued.

# Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation - Not on home anti-coagulation. 
Home metoprolol succinate 25 mg PO QD were continued.

# H/o duodenal polyps - Last seen by ___ in ___. Declined 
repeat EGD or other procedures. ___ GI MD Dr. ___ was 
consulted in the ED, and did not believe ___ pain is likely to 
be GI in etiology. Though he had considered repeat EGD in the 
future, he did does not believe this would add to current 
clinical picture. Felt not to be contributory to abdominal pain. 
Home omeprazole 40mg BID, dicyclomine 10mg PO TID, and 
sucralfate were continued.

# H/o herpes zoster - Home acyclovir 200 mg PO QD were 
continued.

# Nutrition - Home vitamins were continued.

Brief Hospital Course:
___ year old woman s/p renal transplant in ___ on prednisone and 
tacrolimus, chronic pain, CAD s/p NSTEMI ___ (no stent), hx of 
recurrent UTIs, admitted with AMS, ___, and UTI.  

#Pyelonephritis: AMS, abdominal pain, UA and UCx with evidence 
of infection. Given UTI in context of renal translplant, pt was 
treated for pyelonephritis. Empiric treatment with IV 
ciprofloxacin started on admission. Urine culture grew E. Coli 
resistant to ciprofloxacin, sensitive to ceftriaxone. 
Antibiotics changed to IV ceftriaxone on ___. Transitioned to 
PO Cefpodoxime at discharge on ___ to complete a 14day course 
(___). Blood cultures all negative at time of discharge. 

#Hypotension: Patient developed hypotension while in the 
hospital with blood pressures in ___. DDx included 
hypovolemia, adrenal insufficiency, worsening infection. 
Inappropriately low/normal AM cortisol (3.9) and lack of 
improvement with fluids on HOD#3 suggested adrenal insufficiency 
more likely. Pt started on stress dose hydrocortisone on HOD#4 
(___) with good improvement in BP. Pt was given a 30mg PO dose 
of prednisone prior to discharge to finish stress dose course. 
Discharging to home on home-dose prednisone (5mg QD)

# ___ on CKD: Cre 2.1 on admission, from baseline 1.3-1.5. This 
was likely pre-renal in the setting of infection and poor PO 
intake. Improved with fluids/abx. Cre back to baseline at 1.5 
(___) and 1.4 (___) at discharge.

# Hypoxia: Patient was started on 2L NC on admission. CXR 
unremarkable. Lung exam overall unremarkable. Patient was weaned 
off O2 and discharged to home on room air.  

CHRONIC ISSUES:  
 # s/p renal transplant in ___: Patent renal vasculature on 
ultrasound. Patient was continued on her home medications. 
Tacrolimus was held for a dose, but restarted prior to 
discharge. Home dose prednisone and acyclovir were continued. 
Her home fluconazole was stopped and NOT restarted at discharge 
per renal transplant team recs.  
 # CAD: s/p NSTEMI ___ (no stent): Patient was continued on 
home aspirin and statin. Her home metoprolol was fractionated to 
tartrate 25mg PO q6h and then dose reduced to 12.5mg PO Q6H due 
to hypotension during admission. Prior to discharge she was 
restarted an Toprol XL at half of her home dose (50mg PO QD). 
 # Hypothyroidism: Patient was continued on home levothyroxine.  
 
 # Diabetes: last A1c 6.2 ___. No issues during admission. 
Diet-controlled. 
 # Chronic pain: on oxycodone 5 mg q6H PRN at home. This was 
continued during admission and at discharge. 
 # Anxiety: on clonazepam PRN at home  
 # GERD: Continued home omeprazole  
 # bone health: Continued home calcitriol  

Transitional Issues:
-Cefpodoxime 200mg BID for UTI for 14 day course (last day 
___ 
-Stress dose steroids: Patient with soft pressures so started on 
hydrocort 100mg q8 for 3 days. Was given 30mg of prednisone on 
day of discharge to finish 3 day course of stress dose steroids. 
Patient will go back to home dose of 5mg daily on discharge. 
-Home fluconazole stopped on this admission and NOT restarted on 
discharge per renal transplant team
-Metoprolol XL decreased from 100mg daily to 50mg daily on 
discharge for soft pressures. Consider retitrating after active 
infection resolved.

___ EGD:
Impression: 
Normal esophagus with irregular Z-line and small hiatal hernia 
Normal stomach. 
The previously identified 10-15mm flat polyp was identified in 
the ___ duodenum, just distal to the ampulla. 
EMR was undertaken.   The periphery of the polyp lifted well, 
however the central portion lifted partially.  
After in-room consultation with expert colleagues, we proceeded 
with an avulsion technique EMR to attempt removal of the polyp, 
as the alternative here would be surgical resection. 4 pieces 
were taken with the forceps.  Visualization was limited at that 
point due to bowel contraction, so additional samples were not 
taken. 
 
___ UGI:
IMPRESSION:  
No obstruction or leak was demonstrated in the distal esophagus, 
stomach, or duodenum. Duodenal diverticula were seen. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
The patient with history of duodenal polyps was transferred to 
the Surgical Oncology Service for emergent surgical repair of 
Gastro-duodenal perforation s/p EGD. The patient underwent 
exploratory laparotomy with extensive lysis of adhesions, 
excision of duodenal adenoma residual with primary repair of 
duodenal perforation, pedicled omental flap for protection of 
duodenal repair, repair of gastric perforation and G/J-tube 
placement, which went well without complication (please see the 
Operative Note for details). The patient was transferred in TICU 
post op on Protonix gtt. Patient received one unit of pRBC. She 
was extubated on POD 1 and was transferred to the floor on POD 2 
in stable condition. The patient arrived on the floor NPO, on IV 
fluids and antibiotics, with a foley catheter, and Dilaudid PCA 
for pain control. Nephrology team was consulted to manage 
patient's immune suppressions. The patient was hemodynamically 
stable.
Neuro: The patient received Dilaudid PCA with good effect and 
adequate pain control.  When tolerating oral intake, the patient 
was transitioned to oral pain medications.
CV: The patient remained stable from a cardiovascular 
standpoint; vital signs were routinely monitored.
Pulmonary: The patient remained stable from a pulmonary 
standpoint; vital signs were routinely monitored. Good pulmonary 
toilet, and incentive spirrometry were encouraged throughout 
hospitalization.
GI/GU/FEN: Post-operatively, the patient was made NPO with IV 
fluids. Tubefeed was started on POD 3 and slow advanced to goal. 
On POD 5, patient had upper GI swallowing test, which was 
negative for leak and patient's diet was advanced to clears. 
Diet was progressively advanced to regular soft on POD 7 and 
tubefeed was weaned off. Patient's intake and output were 
closely monitored, and IV fluid was adjusted when necessary.  
Electrolytes were routinely followed, and repleted when 
necessary.
GU: Patient with history of kidney transplant s/t ESRD. 
Nephrology followed the patient and her meds were adjusted to 
renal function test. She was remained on her immune suppressants 
during hospitalization and Prograf level was monitored daily. 
ID: Patient was started on Zosyn/Vanc post op, further her 
antibiotics were narrowed to Augmentin. She was found to have 
UTI and was started on Cipro, urine cultures still pending prior 
discharge. Patient remained afebrile with WBC within normal 
limit prior discharge, she will finish her course of antibiotics 
as outpatient.
Endocrine: No issues 
Hematology: The patient received one unit of pRBC post op for 
HCT drop to 28 from 35. The patient's complete blood count was 
examined routinely; no further transfusions were required.
Prophylaxis: The patient received subcutaneous heparin and 
venodyne boots were used during this stay.
At the time of discharge, the patient was doing well, afebrile 
with stable vital signs.  The patient was tolerating a regular 
diet, voiding without assistance, and pain was well controlled.  
The patient received discharge teaching and follow-up 
instructions with understanding verbalized and agreement with 
the discharge plan.

normal, there is no urothelial thickening, and renal sinus fat 
is normal. There is no hydronephrosis and no perinephric fluid 
collection. There is a 4.7 x 4.8 x 4.7 cm simple upper pole 
cyst. 
  
The resistive index of intrarenal arteries ranges from 0.69 to 
0.71, within the normal range. The main renal artery shows a 
normal waveform, with prompt systolic upstroke and continuous 
antegrade diastolic flow, with peak systolic velocity of 49.4 
cm/second. Vascularity is symmetric throughout transplant. The 
transplant renal vein is patent and shows normal waveform. 
IMPRESSION:   
Patent renal transplant vasculature. No hydronephrosis. 

 
1. No definite fracture of the right hip.  If strong clinical 
concern, 
recommend MRI for more sensitive evaluation. 
  
2. Unchanged appearance of the left hip status post apparent 
Girdlestone

Brief Hospital Course:
___ with history of renal transplant, chronic pain, CAD s/p 
NSTEMI and recurrent UTIs who presents with worsening right 
groin pain, hip pain and diarrhea which self resolved.

#Right groin/Hip pain
Given excellent ROM on exam, doubt hip pathology. Patient did 
have hernia on CT in ___ raising concern for incarcerated 
hernia, although not evident on exam. This may be exacerbation 
of chronic pain syndrome given history of pain.  Advised use of 
tlyenol at home and I spoke w PCP about exam and lack of need 
for further inpatient studies.  We agreed she can use low dose 
oxycodone if sleep impaired by pain and I reviewed ___ and 
last filled on ___.  Patient sopped lyrica recently.  No 
acute pathology on hip xray.  Will have f/u w pain center.  
Prior to discharge I wondered if she could have iliacus muscle 
tear or injury of other pelvic muscles though no known trauma 
and if sympotms do not resolve one could pursue this w MRI of 
pelvis or upper leg.  

#Pyuria: initiatlly given ceftriaxone but stopped as 3 species 
of contaminant grew on her urine culture rather than single 
uropathogen. Renal ultrasound unremarkable. 

#Diarrhea Now resolved without intervention

Chronic issues:
# S/P renal transplant in ___: Patent renal vasculature on  
ultrasound. Renal transplant fellow aware of admission. 
Creatinine better than recent baseline.
- continue home dose of prednisone, tacrolimus
  
# CAD: s/p NSTEMI ___ (no stent): 
 metprolol and ASA

#?paroxysmal atrial fibrillation
EKG reviewed seems to have PAC/PVCs

Discharge Instructions:
you were hospitalized for evaluation of pain

at this time we do not have a clear known cause for your pain: 
it may be chronic musculoskeletal pain.  sometimes people can 
have a torn muscle in the groin/pelvis and this can be difficult 
to pick up especially given your history of hip surgery, 
depending on how you respond to medication and monitoring your 
doctor may decide on more testing...ask if you could have 
iliacus muscle tear?

one important thing is to bring all your pill bottles to next 
appointment and review what you should be taking and why
you did not have evidence of uti

___ who presented to CHA on ___ with ___ edema and worsening 
renal function (Cr 5.9 from baseline of ___ found to have 
acute interstitial nephritis.  

# Acute kidney injury ___ Acute Interstitial Nephritis
Patient presented with worsening renal function and creatinine 
elevation to 6.0. Patient was given fluids, which did not 
substantially improve creatinine.  Renal biopsy performed ___, 
results consistent with acute interstital nephritis thought to 
be most likely caused by ranitidine. Possibility of transplant 
rejection was considered however not likely given findings on 
biopsy consistent with acute interstitial nephritis. Furosemide 
also held during this hospital stay in setting of acute kidney 
injury and was not restarted on discharge. Should consider 
restarting as outpatient in follow up transplant clinic.

# ESRD ___ to chronic reflux nephropathy s/p cadaveric renal 
transplant in ___ 
 Patient continued on tacrolimus and prednisone through hospital 
stay. Acute kidney injury as above was determined not be 
secondary to transplant rejection.  Plan to obtain outpatient 
labs on ___ and follow up in transplant clinic.

# Positive UA
On admission, patient's UA positive for 33 RBCs and 10 WBCs, so 
patient was started on meropenem and tranistioned to ___ on 
___ for presumed UTI. Urine cultures however showed no growth 
and it was determined that WBCs in urine were secondary to acute 
interstitial nephritis as above. Ciproflaxacin discontinued on 
___ and patient remained afebrile and without other signs 
or symptoms concerning for urinary tract infection prior to 
discharge. 

# Adrenal insufficiency
Patient's cortisol noted to be 2.4 in setting of hypotension on  
___. Patient intially given 25 mg hydrocortisone stress dose in 
setting of presumed adrenal insufficiency. Prednisone dose was 
then increased to 20 mg daily prior to discharge. Blood pressure 
returned to normal prior to discharge. Patient will continue 
with 20 mg prednisone dose until follow up in transplant clinic. 


# Hyperphosphatemia ___ metabolic bone disease

___ kidney failure and bone mineral disease.  Patient was 
prescribed Aluminum hydroxide 10mL TID for 3 days (day 1, 
___.  On ___, phos was improved to 5.0. Aluminum hydroxide 
was discontinued prior to discharge.

unclear, but problem resolved.  WBC improved to 5.0 on ___, 
prior to discharge.

# ___ rash
Patient initially started on Vancomycin on arrival to the ED for

Stool cultures: negative for c.diff toxin, no growth on cultures
Urine cultures: 100,___bdomen ___:
IMPRESSION: 
1. No evidence of intra-abdominal or intrapelvic infection. 
2. Extensive diverticulosis without diverticulitis. 
3. Stable transplant kidney in the right pelvis. No 
hydronephrosis or 
perinephric fluid. 
4. Stable pneumobilia. 
5. Degenerative changes in the lumbar spine. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
1. DIARRHEA, VOMITING, FEVER:
Pt stated that diarrhea began to resolve upon hospitalization.  
She was afebrile during this admission and had no vomiting.  
Possible infectious etiologies included C. Diff. Colitis given 
recent abx use, viral gastroenteritis, CMV colitis given pt is 
immunosuppressed.  C. Difficile toxins were sent and were 
negative X 3.  Pt was empirically started on Metronidazole for 
possible C.Diff but this was stopped as pt was clinically 
improving and toxin screen came back negative.  CT of abdomen 
did not show any evidence for inflammatory or neoplastic 
diseases.  Chronic malabsorptive etiologies were less likely 
given time course of diarrhea.  Most likely etiology is viral 
gastroenteritis.  CMV serum PCR was negative.  Stool studies for 
salmonella, shigella and viral studies were negative.  
Preliminary blood cultures were negative and final blood 
cultures were pending at the time of dictation.
.
2. HYPOTENSION: 
Per patient report, BP was low (90s/40s) at home, so she did not 
take antihypertensives.  During hospitalization, BP was stable 
at 120s-130s systolic.  Blood pressure medications were 
restarted upon discharge.  Pt was instructed to take her 
Metoprolol but not take her Lisinopril until f/u with Dr. 
___ assessment of renal function and blood pressure.  
Pt takes BP at home and titrates her medications accordingly.
.
3. ACUTE RENAL FAILURE:
Pt arrived with creatinine of 2.3 (baseline 1.0-1.3). Pt was not 
drinking fluids and had decreased urine output prior to 
admission.  Most likely etiology is prerenal, given that after 
4L of fluids, creatinine returned to baseline of 1.3.  FeNA was 
less helpful, as urinalysis was done after receiving fluid.  
Other etiologies included ATN from ischemia or toxin-induced 
nephropathy from medications.  Lisinopril was stopped on 
admission and pt did not report taking any NSAIDs, Ibuprofen, 
Advil or Aleve.  Pt was also acidotic on admission with a 
bicarbonate level of 16.  This improved with fluids and although 
lactate level was 1.2 (after fluids), this likely represents a 
lactic acidosis from dehydration after diarrhea and vomiting.  
Pt has a single functioning transplanted kidney.  Of note, she 
has had 2 prior UTIs and urine culture came back with E.Coli 
100,000 colonies with 1 WBC and few bacteria in the UA.  Pt was 
completely asymptomatic of any urinary tract infection and 
antibiotics were not started at this time.  She will follow-up 
with a urologist, Dr. ___ discharge for her multiple UTIs 
and assess for any reflux. She will follow-up with her PCP ___. 
___ further kidney function studies.  
.
4. S/P RENAL TRANSPLANT ___:
Pt was continued on home dose of Sirolimus and Prednisone.  
Transplant Nephrology assessed the patient during this admission 
and there was no reason to suspect rejection of her transplanted 
kidney.  Sirolimus levels were checked during this admission.
.
5. HYPOTHYROIDISM:
Pt was continued on home dose of Levothyroxine.  TSH level was 
0.19, however free T4 was normal at 1.7.  Pt was euthyroid and 
was discharged on the same dose of Levothyroxine.
.
6. CAD: 
Pt had no symptoms of angina or equivalents during this 
admission. She was continued on aspirin 81mg daily.  She has not 
been on any statins due to side effects of muscle aches.  Her 
Metoprolol was held due to hx of hypotension. 
.
7. INSOMNIA:
Pt was maintained on Ambien 10mg qpm PRN and Clonazepam 0.5mg PO 
BID PRN for insomnia and anxiety.  She had no issues regarding 
these problems during this hospitalization.
.
8. GERD
Outpatient doses of Ranitidine were continued.  Pt did not have 
symptoms of GERD during this hospitalization.
.
9. RESTLESS LEG SYNDROME:
Mirapex 0.250mg was continued for this problem.  
.
10. FEN:
Pt was adequately fluid resuscitated with 3L NS, then 1L of LR 
for acidosis.  She was put on a regular diet.  Her electrolytes 
were normal.
.
11. Hospital Prophylaxis:
Pt was put on pneumoboots for DVT prophylaxis.
.
Pt was told to follow-up with her PCP ___ on ___, 
___.  She will also see a urologist, Dr. ___ to 
follow-up with her problem of recurrent UTIs.  Her C. Diff 
toxins were negative and blood cultures pending at the time of 
dictation.

status post renal transplant, osteonecrosis of L hip s/p 
girdlestoneprocedure w/ chronic low back pain, wheelchair bound, 
CAD, initially admitted ___ for acute encephalopathy and 
hypotension secondary to unintentional opioid overdose, course 
complicated by ___, Cdiff colitis now status post PO vanco 
course, subsequently recovering, discharged to ___ 

# Acute Toxic Encephalopathy / Accidental Poisoning by Opiates / 
Hypotension - patient initially admitted to the ___ for 
encephalopathy after being found down thought secondary to 
opioid overdose.  Workup was negative for additional metabolic, 
infectious causes.  Patient denied recent use of opiates prior 
to admission (reports her son stole them), but exam on admission 
was notable for pinpoint pupils, hypotension, responsive to 
narcan upon arrival to the FICU and with tox screen positive for 
opiates.  CT head without acute process. She had slow 
improvement with initial waxing and waning of her mental status, 
before resolving to baseline.  

# Chronic Pain: Due to scoliosis and left hip removal/R hip 
pain.  Given concern regarding self-administered opiates (see 
above re: accidental overdose), discussion was had with PCP 
regarding changing to fentanyl patch and elimination of prn oral 
opiates.  After agreement, patient started on 25mcg fentanyl and 
was weaned off oxycodone. 

# Recurrent Cdiff Infection: Diagnosed in the setting of 
worsening diarrhea; found to be Cdiff PCR positive.  PO vanco 
started ___, and she completed 14d course with resolution of 
symptoms 

# ___ Transplantation: baseline Cr 0.9 (___) up to Cr
peak 1.8 this admission. Received 3d IV steroid empirically for
mild rejection, probably a large component of pre-renal insult
(pt hypotensive requiring Levophed in FICU) and ATN was noted on
urine sediment. ___ now resolved to 1.3
--discussed with renal tx, will f/u with outpatient transplant
doctor for tac levels

# Hypertension - once hemodynamically stable, continued home 
metoprolol stable

# Adjustment Disorder- evaluated by psychiatry yesterday after 
comments of harming self. Pt was able to clearly state no

Discharge Instructions:
Ms ___,

It was a pleasure caring for you at ___.  You were admitted 
for confusion and kidney injury. You were seen by ICU doctors, 
who determined that the cause of your confusion was likely 
related to your opioid medications. You were treated and 
improved.  

During your hospital course, you developed diarrhea from 
"Cdiff".  You completed a 2 week treatment  with an antibiotic 
called vancomycin.  

You improved and are now ready for discharge to a skilled 
nursing facility.

We also talked intensely about your mood and goals in life. We 
obtained a psychiatry consult who recommended to continue 
further outpatient psychiatry. 

We talked extensively about your pain control balanced with your 
risk of overdose. I have talked with your PCP and we plan to 
discharge you with a fentanyl patch to help control your pain, 
but lessen the risk of overdose. We recommend against the use of 
prn opiate medications--we recommend Tylenol instead.

DIAGNOSTICS AND IMAGING
___ Renal Transplant U/S: Normal waveform and resistive 
indices of the main and intra renal arteries. Patent transplant 
renal vein, with a slightly more pulsatile waveform compared to 
prior exams   

 
Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ is a ___ year old woman s/p renal transplant in ___ 
on prednisone and tacrolimus, chronic pain, CAD s/p NSTEMI ___ 
(no stent), hx of recurrent C diff, h/o Klesbsiella 
pyelonephritis ___, and recently treated UTI, who was 
admitted with hypotension, diarrhea, and ___.

Her admission creatinine was 3.1 prior to transfer to ___. 
Evaluation suggested that etiology was prerenal, which was 
consistent with the patient's story of having frequent diarrhea 
and little PO intake. Her creatinine improved to 1.5 with IV 
fluid repletion. Full workup showed the patient had no 
infection, and was C. diff negative. She had no diarrhea whilst 
inpatient and her blood pressures were also stable with SBPs in 
the 100s-110s.

She was kept on tacrolimus 0.5 mg po bid and prednisone for 
immunosuppression. Her discharge paperwork from ___ led her to  
be on prednisone 20 mg daily, however, review with nephrology 
showed she should be on prednisone 5 mg daily. She was kept on 
acyclovir.

She was also continued on treatment for esophageal candidiasis 
diagnosed at ___. 

For coronary artery disease she was continued on aspirin, 
metoprolol and statin.

For hypothyroidism she was continued on home levothyroxine. TSH 
was low upon evaluation (checked as part of frequent diarrhea 
evaluation) and should be addressed as an outpatient.

Patient also has chronic pain and was treated with oxycodone 5 
mg q6h prn pain. Home clonazepam prn was continued for anxiety. 
Calcitriol continued for bone health. Omperazole continued for 
GERD.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,

It was a pleasure taking care of you during your hospitalization 
at ___. You were admitted 
because your kidney function had decreased and you were having 
low blood pressures. Workup showed that you did not have an 
infection, and it's likely that your symptoms and decreased 
kidney function were a result of not eating and drinking enough 
in the setting of having a few episodes of diarrhea. You were 
given fluids, your diarrhea resolved on its own, and your kidney 
function improved.

It is very important that you continue to eat and drink well, as 
this well help protect your kidney function. If you find that 
you are having diarrhea again and you are not able to drink a 
lot of fluids, please seek medical attention so that you can 
receive IV fluids and your kidney function can be monitored. 

We wish you the best of luck in your health!

Sincerely,
Your ___ Care Team

Brief Hospital Course:
___ F hx of pAF not on AC ___ remote hx of hemorrhagic stroke, 
DDRT (___) on tacrolimus/prednisone, recurrent UTIs including 
VRE and pseudomonas; initially presented as OSH transfer with 
severe sepsis and encephalopathy ___ Morganella UTI requiring 
admission to MICU, stabilized and transferred to the general 
medicine service.

ACTIVE ISSUES:
==============
#AMS
#GOC-Per providers who have taken care of her on prior hospital 
visits, she was significantly altered on admission. Etiology 
likely toxic metabolic encephalopathy iso sepsis, ___, unclear 
if underlying dementia or other primary neurologic process given 
unclear baseline. Ultimately, LP was deferred given patient's 
mental status returned to baseline. On day of discharge, mental 
status was significantly improved.  Required olanzapine nightly 
as needed for nightly agitation, per psychiatry recommendations.
 
#AFib with RVR 
Not anticoagulated due to history of hemorrhagic stroke.  
Initially metoprolol was held in setting of sepsis and 
hypotension.  Transitioned back to home dose of metoprolol 
succinate 50 mg daily during hospitalization.

#Urosepsis
#Hypotension (resolved)
Presented with hypotension, tachycardia, neutrophilic 
leukocytosis, and pyuria c/w urosepsis. Given history of 
recurrent UTI with ESBL E. coli and VRE.  Hypertension improved 
with aggressive fluid resuscitation and stress dose 
hydrocortisone per transplant nephrology recommendations. 
Received a 10 day course of daptomycin for VRE.  Subsequently 
developed Morganella UTI for which she was ultimately treated 
with meropenem monotherapy.  Last day of meropenem monotherapy 
will be ___ (14 day course). Several urine cultures from 
___ - ___ also demonstrated yeast in urine.  
Per infectious disease recommendations she was started on 
fluconazole on ___, with plans for ___nding 
on ___.

___ on CKD
Creatinine elevated to 4.5 on admission from baseline 1.1, 
returned to baseline.  Most likely prerenal in setting of 
hypotension, sepsis. Cr on discharge was 1.1.

#Mixed Respiratory, AG Acidosis, resolved
Mostly attributable to encephalopathy and combined with 
hypoventilation.  Anion gap acidosis most likely in setting of 
renal failure as noted above.

#Renal Transplant
DDRT in ___, maintained on tacrolimus and prednisone. Continued 
 on tacrolimus this admission, received stress dose steroids 
while hypotensive due to concern for adrenal insufficiency. 
Tacrolimus 0.5mg BID was continued with daily levels while 
hospitalized. Prednisone back to home dose on day of discharge. 
- Will need outpatient monitoring of tacrolimus levels as she is 
being initiated on fluconazole 

#Thrombocytopenia
Baseline platelets over 150. Platelets reached nadir of 32, most 
likely sepsis v drug effect as she was on linezolid. DIC workup, 
hemolysis workup negative. Improving substantially on day of 
discharge. 

#Troponinemia
#T2NSTEMI
Noted to have mild troponin elevation to 0.03 on admission, no 
chest pain, non-specific T wave flattening without ST changes on 
EKG. Rechecked demonstrated troponin of 0.01. 

CHRONIC ISSUES
===============
#CAD
-Continue home ASA, rosuvastatin
-Metoprolol as noted above, restarted on home 50mg metoprolol 
succinate daily

#Hypothyroidism
Levothyroxine was increased to 88mcg daily from 44mcg. 
-Transitional issue: Will need outpatient TSH monitoring 

#Anxiety/depression
Home duloxetine held on admission given linezolid 
administration. Linezolid subsequently discontinued. While 
inpatient required PRN olanzapine for nighttime agitation and 
altered mental status, combined with some anxiety. Duloxetine 
was reinitiated at home dose on day of discharge. 
 
#Back pain
On oxycodone at home. Was held on admission due to AMS, since 
restarted. 

#H/o duodenal polyps
Continue home omeprazole, dicyclomine. Sucralfate was not 
continued. 

#Nutrition
Continue home vitamins

Brief Hospital Course:
___ with relevant history including ESRD ___ cadaveric 
transplant in ___ (on prednisone and tacrolimus, basleine 
creatinine ___ and chronic back and leg pain in the setting 
of spinal stenosis and history of osteonecrosis, hypothyroidism, 
panic disorder, grade II esophageal varices and ulcer on EGD on 
___, presenting with worsening back pain and decreased PO 
intake, found to have starvation ketoacidosis and C. difficile 
colitis. 

ACTIVE ISSUES:
# STARVATION KETOACIDOSIS, 
# HYPOTENSION and 
# LOW URINARY OUTPUT: secondary to decreased PO intake. 
Presented with hypoglycemia as well. Acidosis, hypotension and 
low urinary output improved with IV hydration. While in house 
and on discharge, patient taking adequate PO intake of solids & 
liquids. 

# ENCEPHALOPATHY: evaluated for infection, but work up negative. 
Patient on oxycodone SR and ___ at home for chronic pain (low 
doses). Toxicology screen negative. Mental status improved with 
IV hydration and ___ of oxycodone. On discharge, 
alert & oriented x3, though with occasional difficulties with 
word finding, speech latency & paraphrasic errors. CT head from 
___ showed status post left frontal craniotomy. There is no 
evidence of infarction, hemorrhage, edema, or mass. There is 
prominence of the ventricles and sulci suggestive of 
involutional changes. Suspect related to ketoacidosis.  

# ACUTE KIDNEY INJURY: baseline Cr 1.4. Elevated to 1.9 on 
admission, which improved with IV hydration. Transplant kidney 
ultrasound normal, without hydronephrosis. Cr on discharge 1.1. 

# C. DIFFICILE COLITIS, REPEAT EPISODE: patient developed 
diarrhea, and found to be positive for C. difficle toxin on 
___. Vancomycin PO started, and should be continued for 14 day 
course, until ___. No clear precipitant, as had not received 
antibiotics, though immunosuppressed for transplant. 

# BILATERAL SHOULDER PAIN,
# BACK PAIN, and 
# SCIATICA: patient with chronic pain, she describes as 
bilateral shoulders, spinous and right sided sciatica. She takes 
oxycodone SR and ___ for management. CRP elevated (with normal 
ESR), so could consider PMR. Patient offered diagnostic trial of 
increased prednisone, though declined. MRI spine with 
degenerative changes. ___ negative. Given allergies, duloxetine 
started for pain management, and should be uptitrated as 
outpatient. Bilateral rotator cuff injury, as well as sciatica, 
and DJD all also possible etiologies. ___ evaluated & cleared for 
discharge home. Kept oxycontin at home level but reduced 
oxycodone 5mg BID to 2.5mg BID due to concerned for confusion 
following 5mg dose.

# SUSPECTED CIRRHOSIS: esophageal varices identified on OSH EGD 
(___). Coarsening of the liver on abdominal ultrasound. 
Unclear etiology, as denies significant etOH history. Hepatitis 
serologies negative. On admission, LFTs notable for ALT <5, 
likely due to cachexia. Should have outpatient hepatology follow 
up. 

STABLE/CHRONIC ISSUES
=====================
#ESRD s/p cadaveric transplant, CKD: Baseline Cr ___. Pt has 
been making urine. Received 1L NS and mIVF x1 L since admission 
from ED. Patient not taking prophylactic acyclovir (was told to 
stop because of kidney function). Continued home tacrolimus, 
increased from daily to BID. Continued prednisone 5mg daily and 
home calcitriol. 

#ANEMIA: Most recent labs notable for elevated ferritin, c/w 
anemia of chronic disease

#pAF: Fractionated home metoprolol (Metoprolol Succinate XL 50 
mg daily at home). Apparently not anticoagulated except with 
full strength ASA. CHADS2VASC is 5.

#CAD: Home statin, metoprolol as above; pt on full strength ASA 
at home but will give 81 mg.

#HTN: Hold home metoprolol, as above  

#GERD: duodenal ulcer on ___ EGD. Home PPI 

#SOCIAL ISSUES: Pt w/some confusion over her medications, 
unclear compliance. Son, who was previously HCP, is a heroin 
user. Patient is perseverative. Concerns in the past over opioid 
misuse.

Brief Hospital Course:
___ yo woman with h/o ESRD s/p cadaveric transplant ___ y ago, h/o 
cerebral aneurysm, admitted in ___ for urosepsis, who presented 
to ___ clinic at ___ for fevers, aches, confusion, and 
referred to ED for further evaluation. Admitted to medical 
floors. Hospital course complicated by brief transfer to ICU for 
AMS on ___ and subsequently transferred back to the medical 
floors ___. 

#AMS/ metabolic encephalopathy: 
On admission patient was very somnolent though agitated when 
aroused. CT head was negative and labs relatively unremarkable. 
Etiology was presumed hypoactive delirium in setting of UTI. 
Despite adequate treatment and fluid resuscitation mental status 
worsened on first day of admission for unclear reasons; patient  
became progressively more somnolent with periods of apnea. 
Antibiotics were broadened to meningitic/encephalitic coverage. 
She was given 0.4 mg narcan with improvement, raising concern 
for outpatient opiate use with impaired clearance in setting of 
renal failure. Given this concern and potential need for narcan 
drip patient was transferred to MICU. 
Patient was empirically covered for HSV encephalitis with IV 
acyclovir (on po acyclovir 200mg QD as outpatient). UTI 
initially treated with meropenem in ED, then ceftriaxone, then 
vancomycin when urine cx grew enterococcus. Pt remained 
somnolent, minimally responsive. Her son informed the team that 
she has had similarly profound mental status changes in the 
setting of prior urinary tract infections, and he recommended 
giving the abx more time to work.  When urine culture and 
sensitivities revealed E Faecalis resistant to vancomycin, abx 
changed to ampicillin (___). The following morning she was 
alert, oriented x3, answering questions and following commands. 
Stool also tested positive for c. diff and she was started on po 
flagyl TID (___). Given marked improvement in mental status 
after these interventions and continued low suspicion for HSV 
encephalitis on exam, IV acyclovir was discontinued and home po 
acyclovir restarted. Patient was monitored for clinical 
stability and demonstrated no deterioration. Discharged on ___mpicillin and 14 day course metronidazole. Per 
___ consultation, discharged to rehab. 

# Urinary tract infection: As above, patient presented with 
positive UA. Culture grew ENTEROCOCCUS FAECALIS. She was 
initially given meropenen in ED and then transitioned to 
ceftriaxone, then vancomycin, and ultimately to ampicillin based 
on sensitivities. Day 1= ___. Patient to complete 14 day course 
of ampicillin.

#C diff: Patient started on flagyl per above. Planned ___fter completion of ampicillin. 

# Hypoxemia: New O2 requirement to 3L NC on admission. This was 
thought likely secondary to hypoventilation in setting of 
altered mental status as CXR was unremarkable, patient was 
breathing comfortably. O2 weaned prior to discharge.

___: Patient ESRD s/p allograft. Cr 2.6 on admission from 
baseline around 1.4, subsequently trended pack to baseline. 
Suspected prerenal etiology in setting of UTI/poor PO/c diff. 
Renal transplant team followed daily. Daily tacrolimus levels 
checked and tacrolimus changed from 0.5 BID to 0.5 QD given 
increased troughs. Prednisone and calcitriol continued at home 
doses. Home prophylactic acyclovir restarted per above. 

# S/p cadaveric renal transplant: Baseline Cr somewhat unclear 
but appears around 1.4. It was not clear patient was regularly 
filling prednisone/tacrolimus. In ED tacro level was slightly 
low at 4.4. She was initially continued on tacrolimus 0.5mg BID; 
tacrolimus decreased to 0.5mg QD given elevated troughs thought 
to be secondary to diarrhea. Patient discharged on 0.5mg QD with 
plan for lab recheck ___ and adjustment according to troughs. 
Acyclovir was managed per above. Home calcitriol and prednisone 
was continued.  

#atrial fibrillation with RVR: Patient was on metoprolol XL as 
outpatient. In setting of this being held she had episode of 
afib with RVR to 180s, blood pressure stable, with response to 
metoprolol 5 mg IV x1. She was restarted on PO metoprolol. She 
was monitored on telemetry for the remainder of her hospital 
stay and had no further episodes of rapid atrial fibrillation. 

#R hip pain: Patient reported R hip pain of months duration, 
much worse in last few days prior to admission and prompting her

continue these antibiotics as an outpatient. 

We also decreased your tacrolimus dose since the levels were 
elevated due to your diarrhea. You will need labs on ___ 
(tomorrow) and your tacrolimus dose will be adjusted 
accordingly. 

You were also experiencing right hip and groin pain that you

Renal Trasnplant Ultrasound
IMPRESSION: 
Stable transplant renal ultrasound. No hydronephrosis,

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ is a ___ yo F with PMHx of renal transplant in ___, 
who was admitted after having fever, chills, nausea, and 
worsened diarrhea with right costophrenic angle tenderness 
concerning pyelonephritis.  

Given constellation of symptoms, she was thought to have 
possible pyelonephritis. Also may have been related to increased 
diarrhea and there was concern for C. Diff given prior hx of 
infection. There were no symptoms consistent with URI. Given 
repeat UTIs patient was started first on Aztreonam due to her 
history of multiple antibiotic allergies. She was seen by 
urology who recommended an out pt VCUG to assess for reflux and 
has an appointment ___. Two urine cultures showed only mixed 
flora, and she had no fever so was switched to Bactrim DS for 
UTI prophylaxis before discharge. She has previously tolerated 
Bactrim.

Her stool studies were negative for infection including C. Diff. 
She was first started on Flagyl empirically, however, this was 
stopped before discharge after 3 days of treatment. Her diarrhea 
appeared to be chronic and related to antibiotic use. Her 
diarrhea resolved before discharge. GI was consulted and 
followed the patient. Her TSH was found to be low at 0.12, but 
with a normal FT4.  She may have been mildly hyperthyroid, and 
therefore her Synthroid was decreased to 112mcg from 125mcg. She 
will likely need this to be restarted as an out patient. She had 
negative tests for Celiac disease. Loperamide was used for 
diarrhea control PRN once infection was ruled out.   
 
In terms of her ARF, she had poor po intake, insensible losses 
from recent fever, and diarrhea creating a pre-renal etiology. 
Creatinine improved with IVF. Her sirolimus level was low, 
therefore her dose was increased from 1mg to 2mg.

During her admission her blood pressure medications were 
initially held due to hypovolemic state, then restarted before 
discharge.   
  
She was continued on her Ambien 10mg qpm and Clonazepam 0.5mg PO 
BID for insomnia and anxiety.  Also continued on her ranitidine 
for GERD and Mirapex for restless leg. She had several headaches 
that responded well to treatment with Fioricet.

She will have follow up with her nephrologist, urology, and her 
PCP.

Brief Hospital Course:
___ with DDRT in ___, HTN, CAD, presenting with altered mental 
status and hypoxia, found to be in severe sepsis and flu 
positive.

ACTIVE ISSUES 
=============

# Severe sepsis: Pt met SIRS criteria for RR, HR, and was 
hypotensive to ___ from a baseline in 110s on admission. 
Also with ___. She is on chronic steroids and likely has adrenal 
insufficiency. Patient also significantly volume down with 
concentrated H/H due to poor PO intake and diarrhea from Cdiff 
which is likely contributing to low BP and increased HR. She was 
initially empirically on vanc/cefepime but then it was 
discontinued as the patient was improved. She received stress 
dose steroids (3x home dose) for 3 days then back to home dose. 
She was treated with oseltamivir for flu. Fluid resuscitated.   

# Influenza: hypoxia resolved and she was saturating well on RA. 
She was treated with oseltamivir and completed a 5 day course. 
She was off this medication for >48 hours prior to discharge.  

# C diff: patient with diarrhea at home prior to presentation. 
Had received IV antibiotics during last admission a couple of 
weeks ago. She met criteria for severe C. diff. given elevated 
Cr, age. She is also immunosuppressed and has a history of prior 
C diff. She was started on PO Vancomycin for a 2 week course to 
finish on ___. 

# Hypoxemia: Resolved. Pt presented with cough, hypoxemia, and 
altered mental status. She is immunosuppressed. She is flu 
positive which could explain her hypoxia, or she could have a 
secondary bacterial pneumonia as well. A CXR did not show a 
clear pneumonia, however given her clinical presentation and 
hemodynamic instability she was covered initially with 
broad-spectrum antibiotics. She was given vancomycin, 
azithromycin, and cefepime in the ED. These were discontinued as 
there was no PNA and there were alternative reasons for his 
clinical picture. She completed a 5 day course of Oseltamivir 
and her hypoxia improved. She mobilized from the chair to the 
bed with ___ without decreased O2 below 94%. 
 
# ___ on CKD: Baseline Cr 1.3-1.5. Admission Cr 2.3. Ddx 
included pre-renal (esp in light of diarrhea), intrinsic renal, 
tacrolimus toxicity, rejection (though far removed from txp), 
GVHD. Renal transplant ultrasound showed normal resistive 
indices. She was volume resuscitated in the setting of her 
hypotension initially and then allowed to autodiuresis in the 
setting of urine sediment showing signs consistent with ATN. 
Tacrolimus was kept at 0.5mg with daily levels. Her Cr returned 
to baseline 1.4 on the day of discharge.   

# ESRD s/p DDRT (___). She was continued on Tacrolimus 0.5mg 
BID. Home prednisone was increased from 5mg to 15mg for 3 days 
in setting of hypotension and then returned to ___ by the time 
of discharge. PPx with acyclovir 200mg BID was continued, along 
with Calcitriol. 

CHRONIC ISSUES 
==============

# Diabetes: Last A1c 6.2 ___. Maintained on ISS while 
inpatient. 

# Chronic pain: Continued on home oxycodone 5 mg qhs:PRN

# CAD: s/p NSTEMI ___ (no stent). Continued rosuvastatin, 
aspirin, and restarted home metoprolol succinate at 25mg daily. 

# Hypothryoidism. Continued Levothyroxine Sodium 125 mcg PO 
DAILY  

# GERD. Held Omeprazole given that patient states she no longer 
takes this at home. 

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES 
===================

IMAGING
==================
___ RENAL TRANSPLANT U/S:
Essentially normal renal transplant ultrasound.  Blunting of the 
main renal artery waveform in late systole is of indeterminate 
significance. 

___ CXR:
No focal consolidations to suggest pneumonia. 

___ HEAD CT:
No acute intracranial process. 

___ TTE:
The left atrium is normal in size. The estimated right atrial 
pressure is ___ mmHg. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity 
size and regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF 
>55%). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests a normal left ventricular 
filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size 
and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) 
appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no 
aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation. No masses or 
vegetations are seen on the aortic valve. The mitral valve 
leaflets are mildly thickened. No mass or vegetation is seen on 
the mitral valve. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. There is 
mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no 
pericardial effusion. There is an anterior space which most 
likely represents a prominent fat pad. 
 IMPRESSION: Preserved biventricular systolic function. No 
clinically significant valvular regurgitation. Mild pulmonary 
artery systolic hypertension. 
 Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of ___, 
mild pulmonary systolic hypertension is now appreciated. The 
___ of the aortic root and ascending aorta have 
normalized. 

___ MRI head:  
 1. No acute intracranial abnormality including hemorrhage, 
infarct, or enhancing mass.  
 2. Postsurgical changes from left frontal craniotomy from prior 
hematoma evacuation.  
 3. Mild global atrophy and white matter signal abnormality in a 
configuration most suggestive of chronic small vessel ischemic 
disease.  

___ CTabd/pelvis:  
 1. No intra-abdominal collections.  
 2. The thickened soft tissues surrounding the dislocated left 
hip joint (appear similar compared to prior imaging). Suspected 
fat necrosis seen lateral to this is also unchanged.  
 3. Pneumobilia is unchanged and suspected to be secondary to 
the previous cholecystectomy.  
 4. Dependent hypodense material seen in the bladder (suspected 
debris) suggesting a UTI and this should be excluded.  
 5. 2 clusters of peribronchial nodules in the lingula and left 
lower lobe suggest aspiration/ aspiration pneumonia.  
 ___ CXR
 Lungs are clear.  There is no appreciable pleural effusion. 
There is no pneumothorax. 

___ MRI L spine
1. No interval change since ___ MR. 
2. Unchanged trace fluid within L1-L2 intervertebral disc space 
with small fluid collection within L2-L3 intervertebral disc 
with associated linear endplate edema. Given absence of 
prevertebral or soft tissue edema and stability since ___ findings are most likely chronic and degenerative in 
nature. Early discitis cannot be excluded and clinical 
correlation is recommended. 
3. Multilevel degenerative changes of lumbar spine most notable 
at L2-L3 with likely contact of exiting right L2 nerve root and 
L3-L4 with contact of exiting right L3 nerve root, unchanged 
since prior examination. 
4. Stable 1 cm left presacral cystic lesion, unchanged since 
___. 
5. Right iliac fossa transplant kidney with stable 5.4 cm right 
lower pole cyst.

Brief Hospital Course:
BRIEF SUMMARY STATEMENT:
===========================
Ms ___ is a ___ woman with a history of cadaveric renal 
transplant (on Prednisone & Tacrolimus), pAF, prior NSTEMI, HTN 
& chronic abdominal and back pain, who presented from her 
nursing home with fever, nausea, vomiting, & lethargy, 
concerning for sepsis. She was treated with IV antibiotics in 
the ICU initially(Daptomycin & Cefepime, followed by 
Vanc/Zosyn). Once stabilized, she was transferred to the floor. 

ACTIVE ISSUES:
===========================
# SEPSIS: 
Patient presented with fever, tachycardia, and altered mental 
status, concerning for sepsis. Given her immunosuppression, she 
was at high risk for infection. She denied urinary symptoms, and 
urine cx was negative, but she does have a history of VRE UTI. 
She had no cough, and CXR had no evidence of pneumonia. She 
denied headache or neck stiffness, and LP without evidence of 
meningitis. She does have a history of C diff, and is on 
treatment with oral Vancomycin; no recent diarrhea, but did 
present with abdominal pain. No skin lesions. Viral & tick-borne 
illness were tested and were negative. CT A/P ___ showed LLL 
changes c/w ? aspiration vs. PNA as well as debris in bladder. 
MRI spine ___ with stable L2-L3 intervertebral disc space fluid 
collection likely due to degenerative changes. UA She was 
treated initially with a dose of Daptomycin & Cefepime. This was 
transitioned to Vancomycin 750 mg IV Q 24H and 
Piperacillin-Tazobactam 4.5 g IV Q8H, which were stopped on 
___. She was continued on Vancomycin Oral Liquid ___ mg PO/NG 
Q6H for known C diff for 14d. She was also continued on home 
immunosuppression with Tacrolimus 0.5 mg PO Q12H and PredniSONE 
5 mg PO/NG DAILY.

# IATROGENIC HYPERTHYROIDISM: 
On admission, TSH was very low at 0.04 & T4 high at 2.5, 
concerning for hyperthyroidism. She has a history of 
hypothyroidism, diagnosed in ___, and had been on Synthroid 
since then. Per pharmacy records, she has been taking Synthroid 
___ daily since ___. T3 wnl and elevated free T4 concerning 
for iatrogenic hyperthyroid per endocrine team. Synthroid was 
decreased to 88mcg daily. 

# TOXIC METABOLIC ENCEPHALOPATHY: 
At baseline, patient is A&Ox3. During this hospitalization, her 
mental status waxed & waned, with more confusion in the morning. 
She was at high risk for delirium given her age, comorbidities, 
and ICU stay. Her mental status improved to baseline during her 
hospital stay. 

# ABDOMINAL PAIN: 
Patient reported chronic abdominal pain at baseline. Per recent 
admission, OSH EGD ___ was notable for grade II esophageal 
varices and gastric ulcer. Recent RUQ U/S with suspicion for
