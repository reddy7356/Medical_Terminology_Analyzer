HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
Mr. ___ is a ___ year old man with a past medical history of
HTN and hemorrhagic stroke in ___ of last year with subsequent
seizure disorder who presents today with seizure.

Since his stroke, he has had two other episodes of seizure. This
is his third episode. He was at ___ with his son for a
___ game. He went to the bathroom, and then when he came 
back
he was confused, per his son. He was using full sentences but
asking when the game was going to start, which didn't make sense
because the game had already started. He then had a generalized
tonic clonic seizure, lasting 5 minutes which per the son 
started
with a head turn to the left. Fingerstick was normal per report.

He was brought to the ___ ED, and he was noted to be
"post-ictal," somnolent and not following commands. He was
brought for chest x-ray and while there, he had a second 
seizure,
GTC, which per the son started with head turn to the right this
time. This one lasted 45 seconds. He was then administered 2mg 
IV
ativan, and loaded with dilantin (as he had not tolerated Keppra
in the past due to severe agitation).

He has not had any recent infection or sick contacts. No recent
travel. No new medications. He is compliant with his Lamictal.

Review of systems unable to be obtained due to altered mental
status.

About 2 hours after second seizure with ativan, and shortly 
after
dilantin load, patient became more arousable, see exam below.

Clonic Seizure.  He has another episode in the ED (lasting 45 
sec) and recieved Ativan and was loaded with Dilantin.  His 
labwork and Head CT did not note any possible acute inciting 
cause for this event and it was felt to be likely ___ to his 
previous stroke.  His Lamictal was increased to 75mg PO BID and 
he was maintained on Dilantin 100mg TID.  He subsquently did

instruction to gradually increase his Lamictal dosing according

His d/c Dilantin was 100mg TID ___.  Though this must be 
guided by his outpatient neurologist, the plan on discharge was

likely be tapered off Dilantin.
