History of Present Illness:
___ y/o M with  presented to ___ after being found 
down in the woods. 

Per report, patient is homeless with an unknown past medical 
history. He was found down unresponsive by paramedics in the 
woods. ___ was reportedly in the ___. He got an IV and an amp of 
d50 with some improvement in his mental status. He arrived at 
___ still confused/unresponsive but but breathing and with 
a pulse. He got another amp of D50 and improved mental status 
and started to talk. His GCS was documented at 15. He reportedly 
told ___ staff that he was having leg pain and hip pain and 
crawled into the woods because he could not walk. He was lying 
in the woods for 2 days without any po intake. His labs at 
___ were notable for WBC of 2.7, HCT 41, lactate of 19, and 
CK of 1200, and elevated INR. He had a CT head which showed a 6 
mm subdural hemorrhage. He was given 2L NS and a dose of unasyn 
prior to transfer to ___ for further care. 

On arrival to the ___ ED, he appeared disheveled with 
soot/dirt covering his face and extremities. He was initially 
labeled as a trauma patient however there were no abrasions or 
evidence of fracture. He was evaluated by the trauma surgery 
team initially but there was no focus of traumatic injury. The 
patient was initially following some commands but confused and 
not making sense. Temp 35 rectally. His sats dropped to 90% and 
he was intubated for airway protection. He was given roc and 
etomidate for intubation and there was no evidence of obvious 
aspiration. During FAST exam, he became bradycardic to the ___ 
and lost a pulse. He was given CPR for 5 minutes - given 
atroprine, epi (2 rounds), bicarb and had return of spontaneous 
circulation. He had a right tibial IO placed. A left fem line 
was attempted but failed (small hematoma present). A right fem 
line was placed but not in a sterile fashion. He had a rate in 
the 170s and a pressure in the ___. He was started on pressors 
for hypotension including norepi and neo. He was in afib and the 
decision was made to cardiovert him. He got 200 J and converted 
to sinus tach. His pressures improved initially but subsequently 
dropped requiring more pressors. 

Labs significant for abnormal LFTS with tbili of 9.9, albumin 
1.6, creatinine 2.2, INR 10.8, platelets 44, lactate of 11, 
fibrinogen 153.  He had a CT head/Cspine, torso (noncon) which 
showed aspiration and cirrhosis with portal hypertension. CT 
head was unchanged from prior. OG tube was placed which showed 
dark looking material. He was given a protonix bolus. 

Neurosurg was consulted and recommended loading with dilantin. 
Liver aware of patient. 
He was given flagyl, vanco, zosyn. On fentanyl and versed for 
sedation. He was also given 1 unit of FFP with another 3 
ordered. He was given 10 of vitamin K IV, 500 mg thiamine. He 
received a total of 5L NS. He was hypoglycemic in the ED and was 
started on D5NS with K at 200 cc per hour. He also received 4g 
of calcium gluconate, 2g mag.

imaging
CXR: (admission) Prominent left lingular and lower lobe 
pneumonia with concomitant aspiration. 
.
CXR ___
Large areas of pulmonary bleeding in the left mid and lower lung 
zones 
decreased on ___ has subsequently remained stable.  
Smaller areas of consolidation in the right lower lung, probably 
a mixture of pneumonia and more hemorrhage have remained 
relatively stable since admission.  Right paratracheal 
mediastinal widening has been stable, due in part to adenopathy 
seen on the torso CT, ___.  Right internal jugular 
dual-channel catheter ends at the origin of the SVC, left IJ 
line more inferiorly in the mid SVC.  Upper enteric drainage 
tube passes into the stomach and out of view. No pneumothorax. 
.
CT Cspine
IMPRESSION: 
1.  No evidence of acute cervical spine fracture or 
malalignment. 
2.  Bilateral posterior lung field consolidations are partially 
imaged and are better characterized on separate CT torso 
examination. 
.
CT head ___
IMPRESSION:  No significant change compared to outside 
examination with 
redemonstration of a 6-mm left frontal acute subdural hematoma 
and sliver of subdural hemorrhage along the left lateral 
convexity.  No new hemorrhage or midline shift.  No significant 
mass effect. 
Partially opacified right mastoid air cells without acute 
fracture seen. 
.
CT head ___
IMPRESSION: 
1. Small left frontal subdural hematoma with maximum width of 5 
mm.   
2. Possible small right frontal subdural hematoma.  
3. No prior studies are available for comparison.   
4. Fluid in both maxillary sinuses likely related to intubation. 
   
5. No mass effect or hydrocephalus. 
.
CT chest abdomen pelvis
IMPRESSION: 
1.  Hematoma/subcutaneous gas not completely visualized 
overlying the left biceps may be secondary to instrumentation 
for line placement.  Similarly, there is hematoma and fat 
stranding in the left groin, likely from arterial 
catheterization attempt.  No intraabdominal fluid collection or 
hematoma. 2.  Prominent hypoenhancing consolidation of the 
lingula and left lower lobe with air bronchograms, compatible 
with pneumonia with likely concurrent aspiration as demonstrated 
by posterior consolidations of bilateral upper and right lower 
lobes. 3.  Small nodular liver with prominent fatty deposition 
with patent umbilical vein and caput medusae as well as 
bilateral gynecomastia, suggestive of cirrhosis with portal 
hypertension. 4.  Gallbladder wall edema with edema, appearance 
of the stomach and small bowel, likely secondary to aggressive 
fluid resuscitation. 5.  Cholelithiasis. 6.  Small focus of 
pneumobilia could be due to prior instrumentation such as 
sphincterotomy.  Correlate with records if and when available.  
No specific evidence of other etiology such as ascending 
cholangitis. 7.  Fracture of the posterior right 12 th rib of 
unclear chronicity, likely chronic given minimal cortication. 
.
EEG: 
This is an abnormal continuous ICU monitoring study because of 
moderately severe diffuse encephalopathy. The findings on this 
record are 
relatively invariant. This may be related to medication. If this 
background persists as the patient is withdrawn from sedative 
medication, we will attempt to see if the background rhythm is 
reactive to extrinsic stimuli. There were no focal or clear 
epileptic features seen. 
.
TTE
The left atrium is moderately dilated. There is mild symmetric 
left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size. Regional 
left ventricular wall motion is normal. Left ventricular 
systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%). There is abnormal 
septal motion/position. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly 
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic 
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve appears structurally 
normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. The pulmonary artery 
systolic pressure could not be determined. There is no 
pericardial effusion. 
IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Mild symmetric left 
ventricular hypertrophy. Hyperdynamic left ventricular systolic 
function with preserved right ventricular function. No 
clinically significant valvular regurgitation or stenosis. 
Indeterminate pulmonary artery systolic pressure.  
  

 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ with a PMH notable for hepatitis C/cirrhosis transferred 
from OSH in renal failure with septic shock.

# PEA arrest: Patient s/p PEA arrest in the ED with ROSC after 5 
minutes of CPR + epinephrine. He was not a candidate for 
therapeutic cooling given the SDH found on CT head. He was 
admitted to the MICU and monitored closely with the post arrest 
team. The patient ultimately went into an escape rhythm leading 
to asystole on ___. 

# Septic shock secondary to aspiration pneumonia: The patient 
presented hypothermic, tachycardic and with bandemia. This was 
likely secondary to septic shock from an aspiration pneumonia. 
He was intubated for hypoxemic respiratory failure and given 
fentanyl for sedation. His blood cultures grew coagulase 
negative staphlococcus and diphtheria. He was maintained on 
broad spectrum antibiotics, steroids, and maximum hemodynamic 
support with fluids, multiple pressors. Despite aggressive 
efforts, he remained persistently acidemic. He ultimately 
expired from sepsis secondary to pneumonia. 

# Metabolic acidosis: Due to overwhelming lactic acidosis 
ranging from ___. He was treated by maximizing his minute 
ventilation on the vent. He was also started on a bicarb drip in 
addition to starting CVVH with a 32 bicarb bath. Despite these 
efforts, he continued to remain persistently acidemic with pH 
around 7.0.  

# Subdural hematoma: Noted to have a 6 mm left, frontal, acute 
subdural hematoma. He was evaluated by neurosurgery who 
recommended no urgent neurosurgical procedure. His coagulopathy 
was treated with vitamin K, FFP, and platelets. He eventually 
developed DIC. He was started on Dilantin which was switched to 
keppra in the setting of his liver disease for seizure 
prophylaxis. Repreat imaging showed a stable hematoma. 

# Acute on chronic liver failure: Patient had evidence of 
cirrhosis and portal hypertension on imaging studies. Per old 
records, patient has HCV cirrhosis  (genotype Ia, VL 595,500 
___ and history of significant alcohol abuse. Patient likely 
decompensated in the setting of septic shock and hypotension. 
Initially there was some concern for dark material on OG output 
concerning for a bleed and he was started on a PPI and 
octreotide gtt. 

# Rhabdomyolysis - Patient noted to have blood in urine with 
only 2 RBCs and found to have CK elevated to 1200 at OSH all in 
the setting of being found down in the woods for an unknown 
period of time. He was given fluid resuscitation but ultimately 
required CVVH.  

# Hypoglycemia - Noted to be hypoglycemic in the field, at OSH, 
and in ___ ED. He was started on D5 in fluids to maintain 
normoglycemia. Hypoglycemia likely from hepatic/renal failure 
and sepsis. 

# Atrial fibrillation - Patient noted to be in Afib with RVR in 
the ED s/p arrest. He underwent a synchronized cardioversion 
with 200J in the emergency department with conversion to sinus 
tachycardia. 

# Acute renal failure - Most likely secondary to ATN from 
hypotension and hypovolemic from poor po intake for days. Urine 
output diminished. Renal was consulted and patient was started 
on CVVH.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the orthopaedic surgery service and 
was taken to the operating room for above described procedure. 
Please see separately dictated operative report for details. The 
surgery was uncomplicated and the patient tolerated the 
procedure well. Patient received perioperative IV antibiotics.
 
During the procedure a bone specimen was sent for frozen section 
which revealed no neutrophils and no evidence of acute 
infection. The procedure was complicated by hypotension (SBP in 
the ___ and 2L blood loss for which he received 4u PRBCs, 1u 
platelets, 2u FFP, 200ml cell saver, 6L LR, and was started on 2 
pressors (phenylephrine and norepinephrine). He remained 
intubated post-procedure on propofol, and the norepi was weaned 
off. UOP was 1420ml. He received vanc 1000mg x 2 doses and 
cephazolin 2g IV x3 doses in the PACU. On arrival to the MICU 
patient remained intubated on pressure support ___, 40%, on 
propofol 50mcg/kg/min. The phenylephrine was weaned off with SBP 
in the high ___ 100s. (Please see below for details of ICU 
course.) He was extubated POD#1, remained HD stable and was 
transferred to the floor on POD#2.  He required additional 
2units PRBC for HCT 22 on POD#3, to which he responded 
appropriately with a post transfusion Hct 26.4.

Otherwise, once extubated pain was initially controlled with IV 
medicatiob followed by transition to oral pain medications on 
POD#1.  The patient received lovenox for DVT prophylaxis 
starting on the morning of POD#1.  The foley was removed on 
POD#3 and the patient was voiding independently thereafter. The 
surgical dressing was 
changed on POD#2 and the surgical incision was found to be clean 
and intact without erythema or abnormal drainage. The patient 
was seen daily by physical therapy. Labs were checked throughout 
the hospital course and repleted accordingly. At the time of 
discharge the patient was tolerating a regular diet and feeling 
well.  The patient was afebrile with stable vital signs.  The 
patient's hematocrit was acceptable and pain was adequately 
controlled on an oral regimen. The operative extremity was

________________________________________________________________
FICU course below:
# Hypotension: Patient was hypotensive in the OR in the setting 
of 2L blood loss and sedation, and received 6L LR and 4u PRBCs 
with rise in HCT. Upon arrival to the ICU he was weaned off 
pressors and remained normotensive (SBP high ___ - low 100s 
which appears to be his baseline in setting of liver disease). 
Hct remained stable at 26 with no signs of bleeding.  As a 
result, he was transferred back to the ortho service.
.
# Respiratory: Patient was intubated for the left hip 
arthroplasty. He was weaned to pressure support upon arrival to 
the ICU and was extubated shortly thereafter. O2 sats are in the 
high ___ on room air.   
.
# Left hip infection/arthroplasty: Continued vancomycin 
overnight in the ICU while culture data is pending. Also 
continued lovenox for DVT prophylaxis. Pain was well controlled 
with standing tylenol, ketorolac, and dilaudid prn.  
.
# Etoh use: Patient reports distant history of etoh abuse but 
has been sober for the past several years. There were no signs 
of etoh withdrawal and no indication for CIWA. We started a 
multivitamin, thiamine, and folate. 
.
# Thrombocytopenia: Chronic, likely secondary to both etoh abuse 
and patient's suspected cirrhosis.  
. 
# Elevated right hemidiaphragm: More prominent on current CXR 
compared to the film from ___, though may be due to the 
fact that the patient was intubated with poor inspiratory 
effort. Recommend repeat CXR to reassess now that patient is 
extubated, and if persistent patient will need outpatient f/u 
for this. 
.
# BPH: Continued tamsulosin.

Chief Complaint:
Chronically infected THR performed  at OSH ___ year ago, 
presenting for explant THR and placement of a cement antibiotic 
spacer 
 
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
left THR hardware removal and  placement of a cement antibiotic 
spacer 
 
History of Present Illness:
___ yo male with history of Hep C (presumed) cirrhosis, left THR, 
and prior sepsis in ___ presented to the OR for septic left THR 
hardware removal and left femoral osteotomy with placement of a 
cement antibiotic spacer admitted to the FICU with hypotension.  


Mr. ___ was initially referred from ___ 
___ for evaluation of chronic hip pain, which worsened 
recently. He reports his initial hip replacement at ___ 
___ in ___ in the early ___ for what was presumed to be 
avascular necrosis, as a result an accidental fall from a roof 
in ___.  He has ___nd ___ with activity, 
relieved with oxycodone 15mg q6h.  He is able to walk on 
cruthces at SNF, but often "gives up and uses a wheelchair".  A 
suspicious bone scan and elevated inflammatory markers were done 
as an outpatient and lead to a high suspicion for a septic hip.  
An aspiration was without growth as an outpatient but the 
decision was made to remove the hardware and place a spacer.  
Staph aureus decolonization was instructed for prior to the 
surgery.  He had not been taking any outpatient oral abx.

In the OR, his total hip hardware was removed.  A cement spacer 
was molded in place of the hip and the left femur after 
osteotomy.  Two drains were placed in the hip.  He developed 
hypotension requiring phenylephrine and norepinephrine.  This 
was thought to be due to septic physiology however, EBL was 
noted to be 3500cc.  He received 7pRBC's, 4 units of FFP, 500cc 
of albumin, and 2300cc of NS.  Throughout the procedure, his 
calculated hct was 32 but UOP was only 75cc.  He received 1gram 
of vancomycin intraop with 16mg of morphine and 0.8mg of 
dilaudid for pain.  ID was consulted.  An aline was placed.  He 
was reversed on arrival with neostigmine and glycopyrrolate. 
 
On arrival to the MICU, patient's VS were BP 98.6 90/60 on 
phenylephrine 0.4, 127 12 100% on RA. He is reporting ___ pain 
in the left hip but no other symptoms.  
 
Review of systems:  
(+) Per HPI  
(-) Denies fever, chills, night sweats, recent weight loss or 
gain. Denies headache, sinus tenderness, rhinorrhea or 
congestion. Denies shortness of breath, cough, or wheezing.

Brief Course:
___ yo male with Hep C cirrhosis, recent septic shock with ___ 
requiring HD, and prior left THR presents after ___ for presumed 
left septic hip with hypotension, transfered to the ICU. 

# Acute blood loss anemia: Pt with 3.5L blood loss during 
surgery. He was transferred to the ICU and briefly required

to the ortho service for further management....  

# Left septic hip s/p removal of hardware: Presumed septic hip 
given elevated inflammatory markers and suspicious bone scan.  
Gram stains all negative but cultures still pending.  Yeast grew 
on tissue culture from OR. ID was consulted and pt was placed on 
Vancomycin and Ceftriaxone added pending final culture data. 

# Hypotension: Secondary to blood loss as above. He improved 
with blood transfusions and only briefly required pressors. Low 
concern for sepsis given pt remained afebrile and improved with 
volume. 

# EtOH Abuse: Hx of heavy EtOH and prior withdrawals.  No hx of 
DT's.  Reports last drink as 48 hours ago on presentation. He 
had no signs or symptoms of withdrawal. He was continued on MVI, 
thiamine, folate daily. 

# Hep C cirrhosis: Presumed cirrhosis given elevated INR, 
hypoalbuminemia, and thrombocytopenia. No evidence of 
decompensation.
