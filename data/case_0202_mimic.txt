Brief Hospital Course:
ICU Course: 
Mr. ___ was admitted to the Neuro ICU on ___, arrived 
intubated from the ED. EVD was placed by ___ immediately on 
arrival to the ICU. EVD was subsequently noted to be ___ the 
parenchyma, and was retracted x2. After placement was confirmed 
post-retraction, intrathecal tPA was started at 1mg q8h and 
continued for total of 9 doses ___. He initially had had low 
urine output, for which a FeNA was calculated 0.0% and Urine NA 
<20, concerning for hypovolemia, so he was given multiple fluid 
boluses. 

On ___, he had tremulousness concerning for EtOH withdrawal, 
and was started on phenobarb taper protocol. 

Over the weekend of ___, He became delirious on precedex, 
writing "nurse trying to kill him, allergic to insulin". He then 
became tachpneic with increase work of breathing with copious 
yellow secretions. He was given nebs, IVF were stopped (net +7L) 
and ventilatory settings were increased. He was empirically 
started on vancomycin and cefepime for VAP. He had a Bronch 
(___), whose culture eventually grew commensal flora. He 
developed ARDS, and required PEEP as high as 15. He was managed 
per ARDSnet protocol. 
Renal was consulted for low urine output, hematuria and gross 
urine sediment, for which they recommended: Renal US (notable 
for simple renal cysts), replaced foley. They felt renal 
dysfunction was likely multifactorial ___ to renal 
vasoconstriction ___ contrast and ACEI as well as sepsis as well 
as volume overload state. he was volume overloaded, but 
intravascularly deplete given NICOM and urine NA, so recommended 
Lasix 80 mg. Furthermore, his sediment had many RBC (not 
flomerular) as well as a few muddy brown casts. On ___, given 
concern for sepsis and adequate urine production and NICOM 
showing a 9.7% change ___ cardiac index with passive leg raise, 
diuresis was held. However, his ventilatory requirements 
increased on ___ ___ setting of fluid bolus, for which he was 
given Lasix 80 mg with ~1200 UOP. Urology was also consulted for 
hematuria workup, for which they recommended outpatient workup. 
Heme was consulted for low platelets and prolonged ___, which was 
likely due to etOH abuse, as patient had normal smear. They 
recommended fibrinogen to ensure there is no comsumptive process 
and abd US of liver and spleen which showed hepatic steatosis, 
though couldn't rule out cirrhosis, small volume ascites and 
spleen at uln for size. 

EVD stopped draining ___ pm, and was subsequently removed 
___ am after multiple attempts to troubleshoot the EVD failed. 
It was presumed clotted. Follow-up imaging showed no developing 
hydrocephalus and EVD was not replaced.

His course was complicated by pneumonia, treated with 7 day 
course of vancomycin and cefepime, ARDS, treated with mechanical 
ventilation per ARDSnet protocol, and c. difficile colitis, 
treated with IV metronidazole. Given rising leukocytosis and 
intermittent fevers despite this treatment, PO vancomycin was 
added to IV metronidazole. These were continued for 14 days 
after cessation of broad-spectruma antibiotics. Tracheostomy and 
PEG placement were performed on ___, without event. Patient 
was seen to have sudden ___ weakness on ___ for which MRI C and 
T spine were performed with no findings. He underwent subsequent 
EMG/NCS which showed severe axonal polyneuropathy suggestive of 
critical illness myoneuropathy. Due to concern for respiratory 
involvement, he was monitored with NIF/VCs. 

Over weekend of ___, patient was seen to spike fevers with 
cultures collected. CT Abdomen/Pelvis was performed which showed 
hepatobiliary findings consistent with chronic pancreatitis. 
LENIs and f/u CT Chest were negative for pulmonary embolism or 
DVT. On ___, patient had worsening respiratory status and new 
onset maculopapular rash which spread over the following days. 
Respiratory status improved with increased PEEP and standing 
diuretic regimen. Allergy and Dermatology evaluated patient and 
were confident due to delayed drug allergy, possibly ___ relation 
to previous administration of Cefepime. Pantoprazole was stopped 
due to possible inciting agent. No significant eosinophilia seen 
___ urine or on CBC. Sarna lotion was started for symptomatic 
relief. 

On ___, patient's platelets dropped from 160 to 75 with SQH 
being stopped due to concern for HIT. Patient was also seen to 
have swelling LUE with f/u Doppler US negative. On ___, his 
platelets dropped further to 15 and pt received platelet 
transfusion x 2. He was evaluated by ID and Heme and Abx 
including Vancomycin, Cipro, and Flagyl as well as Lasix were 
discontinued to concern for drug-induced thrombocytopenia. 
Following this time, patient's platelet level improved as did 
his drug rash. He was restarted on Lasix on ___ without 
complications with goal of improved respiratory status. 
Following this time, pt began to gain strength gradually ___ 
lower extremities. He was slowly weaned off vent with increasing 
tolerance of trach collar. 

HTN was treated with nicardipine gtt ___ the ICU, and eventually 
transferred to PO therapies with Labetalol and Amlodipine. 
Isordil was started but shortly discontinued on ___ due to 
concern for drug reaction. 

DM was treated with insulin gtt ___ the ICU, and was eventually 
transferred to SQ therapies with Sliding Scale per ___ 
recommendations.

Mr. ___ has had recurrent urinary retention, and has failed 
multiple voiding trials. 

24 hour events prior to discharge: 
- No overnight events.

Stroke can have many different causes, so we assessed you for 
medical conditions that might raise your risk of having stroke. 
___ order to prevent future strokes, we plan to modify those risk 
factors. Your risk factors are:

We are changing your medications Please take your medications as 
prescribed.

Please follow up with Neurology and your primary care physician
