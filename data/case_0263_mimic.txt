chest pain for which he has been evaluated with two non-imaging 
stress tests. He states that his previous chest pain was 
non-exertional. For the last three months, he has had worsening 
chest pain on exertion (___). He states that his most 
frequently occurs when walking rapidly or lifting heavy objects. 
It is just left of the sternum an occasionally radiates down the 
left arm. He describes it as stabbing, but sys sometimes it 
feels as if someone were sitting on his chest. During more 
intense episodes, he also has shortness of breath and 
diaphoresis.  
.  
Two months ago, he reports that he presented to a hospital in

has had several episodes at rest of mild intensity lasting 
seconds.  
.  
He was referred to the ED by his PCP ___ (given ASA in office; 
also takes it at home). In the ED, CT of the head was done as he 
was complaining of a headache which has now largely resolved and 
has hx of prior CVA in ___. EKG showed baseline RBBB with new 
TWI in III. First set of cardiac enzymes negative.

Review of prior discharge summaries reveals that his exertional 
symptoms have been present since at least ___.

On review of systems, he denies any prior history of stroke, 
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the 
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black

CT HEAD
Final Report 
HISTORY: ___ male with headache, rule out mass. 
  
COMPARISON: ___. 
  
TECHNIQUE: Contiguous axial images of the head were obtained 
without IV 
contrast. 
  
FINDINGS: There is no intracranial hemorrhage, edema, mass 
effect, shift of 
normally midline structures, or acute major vascular territorial 
infarction.  
The ventricles and sulci are mildly prominent, with prominence 
of the 
bifrontal extra-axial CSF spaces, likely reflecting atrophy. 
Visualized 
paranasal sinuses reveal patchy opacification of the anterior 
ethmoid air 
cells bilaterally, and near complete opacification of the 
frontal sinuses. 
  
IMPRESSION: 
1. No acute intracranial process. 
2. Sinus opacification as detailed. 
.
.
.
RUQ U/S
Final Report 
HISTORY: ___ male with history epigastric right upper 
quadrant pain, 
rule out cholecystitis. 
  
COMPARISON: No prior studies available for comparison. 
  
FINDINGS: The liver is mildly echogenic, suggestive of fatty 
infiltration.  
Within the right lobe of the liver, there is a 1.2 cm x 1.3 cm x 
1.3 cm 
rounded hypoechoic lesion without demonstrable color flow, which 
is 
incompletely characterized. The liver is otherwise unremarkable. 
The portal 
vein is patent with hepatopetal flow. The gallbladder is normal 
without 
gallstones. No pericholecystic fluid or sonographic ___ 
sign was 
evident. There is no intra or extrahepatic biliary ductal 
dilatation with the 
CBD measuring 2 mm. No perihepatic ascites is seen. 
  
IMPRESSION: 
1. No evidence of cholelithiasis or cholecystitis. 
  
2. Mildly echogenic liver, suggestive of fatty infiltration. 
  
3. 1.3 cm rounded hypoechoic lesion, within the right lobe of 
the liver, 
incompletely characterized. This can be further evaluated with 
MR, on a 
non-emergent basis. 
  
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

Final Report 
CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___ 
  
Comparison is made with a prior study from ___. 
  
CLINICAL HISTORY: History of chest pain. Question pneumonia. 
  
FINDINGS: PA and lateral views of the chest are obtained. Low 
lung volumes 
somewhat limits evaluation. There is crowding of 
bronchovasculature at the 
lung bases which somewhat limits evaluation for subtle 
pneumonia. There is, 
however, no definite evidence of pneumonia or CHF. No pleural 
effusion or 
pneumothorax is seen. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal. 
Bony 
structures are intact. 
  
IMPRESSION: No acute findings. Limited study. 
  
___. ___ 
___: SAT ___ 6:27 ___ 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ with HTN and HLD presents with symptoms of stable angina.  
.  
# Chest Pain: At first, there was concerned for unstable angina 
as it seemed that these symptoms were entirely new over the past 
___ months with rapid progression, but review of d/c summaries 
shows that the pt presented with the same hx in ___, ___ 
years ago. His last non-imaging stress test did show some 
non-specific EKG changes not present previously. His last stress 
with imaging was a stress echo in ___ showing no wall mtn abnl. 
It is likely that the pt has coronary disease which is stable. 
Given the reproducibility of his CP with exertion and his risk 
factors, he should have another stress echo vs stress MIBI. His 
rest chest pain is atypical and fleeting, low suspicion for ACS. 
He ruled out with 3 sets of cardiac enzymes. We decided to 
conservatively treat the pt's angina medically in order to avoid 
cath for the time being (there is no mortality benefit for 
medical treatment vs cath in this situation). We started him on 
metoprolol 12.5 bid and also provided him with sublingual nitro 
prn. After starting metoprolol the pt was walked around the 
floor and had improved relief of anginal sx. We also sent him 
home on ASA 325 and pravastatin 40bid. We have planned to have 
him f/u with his cardiologist to in a few days to determine if 
his anginal symptoms are reduced, if they persist, cath may be 
necessary.

# Continued tobacco use: discussed with pt at length. pt agrees 
to try nicotine patch.  
.  
# Hypothyroid: no active issues. continue synthroid

# Hx CVA: head CT in ED neg. cont ASA

.
previous ekg - ___ - Sinus rhythm. First degree A-V delay. 
Right bundle-branch block. Since the previous tracing earlier 
this date no significant change.
 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ ___ gentleman with past medical history 
significant for hypothyroidism, hyperlipidemia, gastritis/gerd, 
prostadynia, and a distant history of stroke in ___ yo 
presented to ED with substernal chest pain and tightness. 
Troponin negative x3 but with mildly positive stress test in the 
ED. Admitted for medical management.
.
#) CV 
- chest pain differential diagnosis includes atypical chest pain 
vs. pleuritic vs. musculoskeletal. The troponins were negative 
x3 with normal CK-MB normal. As there was no acute evidence of 
ACS did not require IV heparin. Patient was monitored on 
telemetry, noted to have normal sinus rhythm with occasional 
sinus pause. Patient is already on appropriate therapy for CAD 
including statin and asa, even though stress test equivocal and 
no documented evidence of CAD. Stress test mildly positive 
stress test with atypical chest pain, however of note patient 
with 5 previous stress tests since ___.  Comtemplated starting 
beta blocker on this patient however BP < 100 so felt was 
unnecessary.  Chest x-ray was clear so unlikely that chest pain 
PNA, also afebrile without a white count. d-dimer not elevated 
making PE unlikely source for pain; also patient not tachycardic 
or tachypneic.  In addition, ESR was normal so unlikely there is 
any vasculitis.  Pain most likely musculoskeletal, treated with 
Tylenol.
.
#) lipids
- cont statin
.
#) Gastritis: PPi was continued in house.  Patient had some mild 
tenderness to palpation over RUQ and RLQ withut and rebounding 
or guarding. LFTs were normal.  Would follow abdominal exam on 
subsequent exams. Encouraged low fat diet rich with fruits and 
vegetables.
.
#) Hypothyroid - Levothryoxine was continued at home dose. TSH 
was < 0.02, was re-checked on discharge.  Will not adjust 
medication in house as not acute issue, however would consider 
outpatient titration of thyroid medications.
.
#) Ear/Jaw pain - likely TMJ given symptom description.   Pt on 
amitrypline as outpatient, continued in house.  Considered 
initially temporal arteritis given jaw/chest pain, however ESR 
is 8 so extremely unlikely.  TM on inspection without any gross 
abnormality. TM intact without purulence.  Could potentially be 
viral in etiology.  Would follow in clinic.  If continues to 
have pain could proceed with more involved work-up including ENT 
referral. Doubt need for it at this time. 
.
#) Eosinophilia
- this is an old problem likely from e. histolytica infection 
previously noted in PCP records for which he underwent treatment
- will trend CBC, will check stool O+P, stronglyoides antibody
.
#) Prophylaxis: PPI, sc heparin, bowel regimen
.
#) FEN: replete lytes prn, low cholesterol, heart healthy diet
.
#) Access: PIVs
.
#) Code Status: Full

management required at this time.  You should continue to take
