abdominal pain and anxiety
 
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:

History of Present Illness:
___ with history of severe gastritis (documented by EGD ___ 
showing friable mucosa) presenting with vomiting and epigastric 
abdominal pain in the context of severe social stressors.

The patient has a long history of abdominal pain that began at 
age ___. She reports that this episode began 2 weeks ago at the 
same time that her estranged mother ___ came to ___ and 
did not meet with the patient or her baby. Over the past 4 days, 
she had intermittent vomiting relieved only by marijuana 
smoking. This morning, she woke up and had 2x emesis at 5 a.m. 
this morning with worsening abdominal pain and diminishing 
appetite. Her epigastric pain is located directly under the 
xyphoid, sometimes radiates to the throat, is ___ in 
severity, crampy in quality. She denies blood in emesis or 
stool. She denies any other drug use or ingestions. No diarrhea.

The patient had an EGD in ___, which showed friable 
mucosa consistent with severe gastritis with bleeding even on 
slightest touch.

Per OMR, patient was admitted to ___ in ___ with 
nausea/vomiting and severe epigastric pain days in the context 
of pregnany. She was treated with a number of medications 
including antiemetics, PPI, H2 blocker, maalox, and PRN 
morphine, but her abdominal pain persisted. Her basic labs were 
normal. GI saw her, she had a normal RUQ ultrasound and 
abdominal/pelvic MRI, and H.pylori was negative. At one point, a 
stat psychiatric consultation was called as the patient was very 
agitated with chest pain and sense of doom, and she got Ativan 
TID PRN likely due to anxiety/panic/depression. She was later 
seen by ___ of ___ who revealed very limited social 
supports.

In the ED was vomitting so was given apparently 6mg of IV ativan 
cumulatively, and presented to the floor unresponsive except for 
sternal rub. A trigger was called for marked nursing concern. 
Initially the patient was planned with transfer to the MICU for 
airway protection as she was vomitting and unresponsive, but 
eventually during an unsuccesful attempt at a NGT placement, she 
became more awake, and actively fought the placement. Since that 
time she was able to maintain her airway safely, and so the 
transfer was cancelled. She is giving a slightly unclear history 
of exactly what has been happening over the last several days.

In the ED, initial vitals: 97.3 96 136/83 18 100% RA 

Vitals prior to transfer: 98.0 70 130/70 16 100%

___ with history of multiple admissions for abdominal pain 
(severe gastritis documented by EGD ___ showing friable 
mucosa) and anxiety/adjustment disorder presenting with vomiting 
and epigastric abdominal pain in the context of new social 
stressors.

# Vomiting and abdominal pain: She has a long history of severe 
gastritis with many prior admissions for abdominal pain and 
extensive work-up including EGD in ___ showing severe 
gastritis, negative for H. pylori in ___, negative MRI 
___ ___, negative CT ___ ___, and multiple RUQ 
ultrasounds. This admission seemed to be at least partially 
exacerbated by her recent family stressors. She did have 3x 
scant hematemesis while on the floor, but her vitals remained 
stable with normal crit; we presumed small ___ tear 
and communicated with GI in case a future consult was needed. In 
addition to a chronic gastritis exacerbation, we considered 
other causes of her abdominal pain including ectopic (negative 
HCG), PID (no fever, no adnexal tenderness), menstrual pain (not 
having menses), ulcer (negative H. pylori serologies in past), 
cholecystitis (no fever, no RUQ pain), pancreatitis (nl lipase), 
renal colic (pain is epigastric radiating upwards), and we 
concluded her pain was likely a combination of her 
acute-on-chronic gastritis and anxiety/adjustment as in her 
previous admissions. Her pain was intermittent with dramatic 
exacerbations punctuated by intervals of painlessness. She 
continued to report excruciating epigastric abdominal pain 
despite an aggressive regimen including protonix, maalox, tums, 
sucralfate, zophran, promethazine, and prochloperazine, 
ranatidine, and acetaminophen PR and IV. Throughout the 
admission, her abdominal exam remained completely benign, and 
her reported pain actually decreased when we examined epigastric 
region. On ___, she was deemed medically safe for discharge.

# Anxiety and agitation: Per OMR, patient has a history of 
depression, anxiety, and panic attacks. Psych consulted, thinks 
distress intolerance manifested by behavioral dysregulation, 
heightened by separation from her social supports and daughter, 
and a sense of lack of control in the hospital setting. No 
evidence of a primary psychotic disorder or major mood episode. 
Similar to prior admissions, her behavior consisted of thrashing 
in bed, pulling off clothes, cuddling with her cousin in bed, 
tearing apart a pillow, yelling out for her mother, and 
threatening to come to the nurses station naked. Her nurse 
overheard her yelling, "I just want to die," and she was given 
Zydis, placed on 1:1, and ___ overnight ___. She 
was unsectioned in the morning per psych, deemed to be no risk 
by SW and psych, and discharged home for outpatient follow-up.

# Sedation. In the ED was vomitting so was given 6mg of IV 
ativan cumulatively, and presented to the floor unresponsive 
except for sternal rub. A trigger was called for marked nursing 
concern. Initially the patient was planned with transfer to the 
MICU for airway protection as she was vomitting and 
unresponsive, but eventually during an unsuccesful attempt at a 
NGT placement, she became more awake, and actively fought the 
placement. Since that time she was able to maintain her airway 
safely, and so the transfer was cancelled. After her recovery, 
her vitals remained stable until her discharge.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
- We considered this admission to result from an acute 
exacerbation of chronic gastritis in the setting of psychosocial 
stressors.
- She was place on a 1:1 sitter as she would not speak to 
psychiatry after saying she wished to die. The sitter was 
discontinued after she later denied having any SI/HI.
- For her gastritis, we started her own omeprazole and 
ranitidine.
- For her nausea and vomiting, we discharged gave her Zophran.
- We encouraged her to follow-up with her PCP for both primary 
health care and referral to providers to help her with her 
psychosocial and coping skills.

Brief Hospital Course:
___ y/o G3P0 admitted at ___ with epigastric pain, nausea and 
vomiting. This appeared to be an exacerbation of her 
hyperemesis/gastritis, likely due to not taking her protonix 
(ran out of medication). She was admitted for IV hydration, 
antiemetics, IV protonix and Ativan. Electrolytes were also 
repleted. A quick bedside ultrasound was performed and was 
reassuring. Her symptoms were eventually well controlled on po 
Ativan, protonix, and pepcid.
.
A repeat 24 hour urine collection was obtained given her 
previous collection revealed 289mg of protein. This time, there 
was 429mg of protein, confirming the diagnosis of mild 
preeclampsia at 27w5d. Her blood pressures were 130-140s/70-80s. 
Labs were significant for intermittent mildly elevated LFTs, 
otherwise normal. A RUQ ultrasound and hepatitis panel were 
unremarkable. Her LFTs normalized completely. Another 24 hour 
urine collection was done at approximately 28 weeks given her 
blood pressures and labs remained stable, and this was revealed 
no protein. Due to the discrepancy from her previous 24 hour 
collection, the lab processed her urine again and verified the 
negative protein result. The decision was made to discharge her 
home and manage her with close surveillance as an outpatient.
.
Fetal testing was reassuring throughout this admission. She 
received a course of betamethasone for fetal lung maturity 
(complete on ___ and the NICU was consulted.
.
Of note, psychiatry was consulted again during this admission 
due to her unusual behavior and the team felt her presentation 
was most consistent with adjustment disorder with anxious mood 
and impulsive behavior. She was continued on Ativan which 
improved her mood and this was continued upon discharge.
.
In regards to routine prenatal testing, a GTT was deferred given 
her gastritis and nausea/vomiting. Multiple fasting glucose 
levels were normal during her admission and her fetus was 
measuring size equal to dates. This decision was made after 
discussion with ___. She received Rhogam on ___ due to her 
Rh negative status. She had no vaginal bleeding throughout this 
admission. In addition, she had a negative GBS on ___.
.
Ms ___ was discharged home in stable condition on ___. 
She was counseled extensively regarding the importance of close 
followup, including twice weekly fetal testing.

epigastric pain. She presented with symptoms similar to her 
previous admissions, however, was noted to have elevated blood 
pressures. Preeclampsia labs were normal. She was transferred to 
the antepartum floor for supportive care and a 24 hour urine 
collection. Her 24 hour urine returned positive with 828mg of 
protein.  Her blood pressures remained elevated and met criteria 
for severe.  At this time she also complained of a headache and 
visual changes and was sent to L&D for induction.

On L&D, she had a failed induction after cytotec, pitocin, and a 
foley bulb.  She was recommended a primary c-section to which 
she consented.  Please see operative note for full details.

Post-partum, she was placed on magnesium for 24 hours given her 
severe pre-eclampsia. Her blood pressures were persistently 
elevated to 150s/90s and thus she was started on oral labetolol 
200mg bid on post-partum day 0, with good control of blood 
pressures until discharge.

Post-partum, she was followed for the following other issues as 
well:
1. Gastritis: Immediately post-partum, the patient was not 
experiencing any gastric pain. She was maintained on famotidine 
and protonix. By PPD3, she was complaining of increasing 
epigastric pain. She was given pepto-bismul and bicitra, which 
moderately helped her pain. By discharge, the pain was 
moderately well-controlled with all four agents and percocet. 
She is to follow-up with the GI doctors ___ Dr. 
___ regarding her pain.

2. Polyuria: The patient's urine output on labor and delivery 
was noted to be as high as a liter an hour. The urine Osms and 
serum Osms were within normal limits, with no concern for 
diabetes insipidus. A nephrology consult was placed, and the 
team recommended a water deprivation test. This test was 
attempted, but was limited ___ to patient non-compliance with 
the test. It did show a reassuring trend for etiology as primary 
polydipsia, with increasing serum Osm with water restriction. 
The patient's thirst decreased and she began to drink less and 
have more normal urine output by PPD4.
 
3. Pysch: The patient was restarted on celexa 30mg qd 
post-partum and discharged on her home regimen of 20mg qd 
post-partum. She did not require any additional psychotropic 
medications while immediately post-partum. Social work followed 
closely.  

4. General postpartum care: The patient's baby was found to have 
Rh neg blood, and thus thus patient received RhoGAM. She also 
received a TdAP. There were no other post-partum issues.

.
#) Abdominal Pain: 
Ms ___ was given IV hydration, antiemetics, Protonix, and 
Dilaudid during her evaluation in triage. Her pain was unable to 
be controlled and she could not tolerate any po's, therefore, 
she was admitted to the ___ service. Over the course of 
several days she improved with IVF, Phenergan, Protonix, Pepcid, 
Ativan Zofran, Compazine and Carafate. She required small doses 
of IV Dilaudid several times but did not require standing 
narcotic medications. On day of discharge her pain was greatly 
improved and she was tolerating light POs and PO hydration.

#) Agitation/Anxiety:
Ms ___ continued to exhibit unusual behaviors during the 
periods of worsening pain, similar to her previous admissions. 
Examples of her usual behavior are voiding in the bed on 
multiple occasions, curling up on the floor naked, and thrashing 
around uncontrollably. She was seen by psychiatry in house who 
feel she likely has an anxiety disorder. Psych recommended 
Clonazepam 0.25-0.5mg IV BID-TID PRN anxiety for short-term, and 
PO Clonazepam rather than Ativan given that it is longer acting. 
They also recommended an SSRI. Finally they recommended Haldol 
0.5mg IV q8hrs as needed for significant alterations in 
behavior. 

#) Elevated blood pressures: Ms ___ had blood pressures in 
the 140-160/80 range while in house but only in the setting of 
anxiety /pain. When she was not anxious and in pain she was 
normotensive. A 24 hour urine was collected and was negative at 
289 mg. She denies headache or visual changes. Although she 
continued to have her typical epigastric pain she denies any new 
RUQ pain. Her HELLP labs were negative.
