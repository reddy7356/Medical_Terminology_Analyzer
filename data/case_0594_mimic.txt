and intact without erythema or abnormal drainage. The patient 
was seen daily by physical therapy. Labs were checked throughout 
the hospital course and repleted accordingly. At the time of 
discharge the patient was tolerating a regular diet and feeling 
well.  The patient was afebrile with stable vital signs.  The 
patient's hematocrit was acceptable and pain was adequately 
controlled on an oral regimen. The operative extremity was
