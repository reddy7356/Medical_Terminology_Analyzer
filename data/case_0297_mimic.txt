Cardiac Catheterization: ___     ___
Coronary Anatomy
Dominance: Right
The ___ had distal 30% stenosis with origin 90% into the Cx
which was severely tortuous with retroflexion and an S curve 
into
a 70% stenosis into the OM. The LAD was occluded. The RCA was
diffusely and heavily diseased to 90% and serial 70% lesions.
Interventional Details
A 7 ___ EBU guiding catheter was used to engage the LMCA and
provided adequate support. A 180 cm Scion guidewire was then
successfully delivered across the lesion. A Turnpike catheter 
was
advanced into the distal Cx and the wire exchanged for Wiggle
wire. Brought a 7 ___ guideliner in and predilated with a 2.5
mm balloon. Unable to deliver a stent or the Guideliner around
the Cx but a 5.5 ___ guideliner did cross. Delivered a 2.5 x
20 mm Synergy stent and the a more proximal 3.0 x 24mm Synergy
stent. Postdilated with a 3.0 mm balloon. Final angiography
revealed normal flow, no dissection and 0% residual stenosis.
Attention then turned to the RCA. A 7 ___ AL-0.75 Guide
provided good support but despite use of Scion, Prowater, 
___
XT, Pilot 50, ___ Grafix Intermediate wires, I could not cross 
the
proximal lesion. Because there was concern for closing the 
artery
with a dissection flap, the decision was made to
abandon further attempts at the RCA this admission.
Impressions:
1. Successful Impella supported PCI of the Cx with DES.
2. Unsuccessful PCI of the RCA.

IMAGING
==============
___ Cardiovascular ECHO 

The left atrial volume index is mildly increased. No atrial 
septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. The estimated 
right atrial pressure is at least 15 mmHg. Left ventricular wall 
thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There is moderate 
regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with near 
akinesis of the distal half of the anterior wall, anterior 
septum and basal inferior wall. The apex is mildly aneurysmal 
and akinetic. The remaining segments contract normally. No 
intraventricular thrombus is seen. Quantitative 3D LVEF = 37%. 
No LV clot/mass seen. Right ventricular chamber size and free 
wall motion are normal. The diameters of aorta at the sinus, 
ascending and arch levels are normal. The aortic valve leaflets 
(3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. 
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve 
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve 
prolapse. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is 
moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no 
pericardial effusion. 
 IMPRESSION: Normal left ventricular cavity size with moderate 
regional systolic dysfunction consistent with multivessel CAD. 
Moderate mitral regurgitation. Moderate artery pulmonary artery 
systolic hypertension. Mild aortic regurgitation. 
 Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of ___, a 
new basal inferior wall motion abnormality is seen and the 
severity of mitral regurgitation has increased - most likely due 
to papillary muscle dysfunction. Moderate pulmonary artery 
systolic hypertension is now identified. 
 CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: 
 The left ventricular ejection fraction is <40%, a threshold for 
which the patient may benefit from a beta blocker and an ACE 
inhibitor or ___. 

___ Imaging CHEST (PA & LAT)  IMPRESSION:  
Right lower lobe and possibly right upper lobe pneumonia with 
small right and possibly trace left pleural effusions.

to the ___ on ___, HTN, HLD, and T2DM who presented with 
burning chest pain and several days of cough found to have 
community acquired pneumonia and NSTEMI, s/p cardiac cath and 
CABG.

####Medicine Course####
=======================
# NSTEMI.
Patient with known coronary disease and chest pain relieved with 
nitroglycerin, elevated troponins, and ST depressions in V3-V6 
w/ TWI in aVL and V2. Patient was started on IV heparin and 
nitroglycerin, with improvement of symptoms. Cardiac cath 
___ found 100% proximal occlusion of LAD, and progression 
of RCA occlusion (95% compared to 90% in ___. 30% proximal 
LM, LCx stent patent. CABG advised, and patient was agreeable.

# Congestive heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (45%)
Patient initially presented with lower extremity edema and 
dyspnea, initially concerned for worsening of EF in setting of 
NSTEMI. Volume status improved with IV Lasix diuresis. Repeat 
TTE ___ shows worsening of LVEF- now 37% compared to
45% in ___. Anterior apical akinesis with apical LV 
aneurysm seen on echo likely old given nature of prior infarct. 
Given low ferritin (<100) patient also received 4 day course of 
IV ferric Gluconate 250 mg daily.  

# RLL and RUL community acquired bacterial pneumonia
Patient with one week of cough with congestion of right lower 
and upper lobes on CXR. Patient s/p 5 day course of IV 
azithromycin and ceftriaxone with good symptom improvement.

CHRONIC ISSUES: 
==========================
# HTN: stable this admission on home losartan. Metoprolol dose 
was increased to metoprolol succinate 150mg daily for better 
afterload reduction and home amlodipine was discontinued.

# Type II DM, currently blood sugars well controlled. A1C 6.9. 
Home metformin and glipizide were held, and patient received ISS 
with during admission. 

#####Surgical Course#####
Pt  was admitted ___ and underwent preoperative work up. He 
was taken to the operating room on ___ and  underwent the 
following procedure:  Coronary artery bypass graft x 2, Total 
arterial revascularization.
2.  Skeletonized left internal mammary artery to left anterior
descending artery.
3.  Left radial artery to posterior descending artery.
4.  Endoscopic harvesting of the left radial artery. 

 Please see operative note for full surgical details. Pt 
tolerated the procedure well and was transferred to the CVICU in 
stable condition for recovery and invasive monitoring.  He was 
weaned from sedation, awoke neurologically intact, and was 
extubated on POD 1. Pt was weaned from inotropic and vasopressor 
support. Beta blocker was initiated and pt was diuresed toward 
his preoperative weight. He required blood transfusions postop 
for acute blood loss intraop and postop anemia.  Pt remained 
hemodynamically stable and was transferred to the telemetry 
floor for further recovery. Chest tubes and pacing wires were 
discontinued per protocol without incident. Per ___ was 
resumed on his preop Plavix for his recent stent. He was started 
on Imdur to prevent arterial spasm in his arterial conduit. Pt 
was evaluated by the physical therapy service for assistance 
with their strength and mobility. A KUB was done to evaluate for 
ileus. Substantial stool bureden was apparent. Bowel meds 
increased and ___ responded appropriately. By the time of 
discharge on POD #5 pt was ambulating freely, all wounds were 
healing, and pain was controlled with oral analgesics. He was 
discharged to  home with ___ services in good condition with 
appropriate follow up instructions.

History of Present Illness:
This is a ___ year old male with a history of multivessel CAD 
(LAD, LCX, D1, OM1, RCA; has refused CABG), HTN, DMII, who 
presented today to the ED with new onset chest pain radiating 
down both arms and EKG changes.  
 He has stable angina with walking several walks that generally 
improves with rest and nitroglycerin. The patient notes that 
this has been worsening recently, and that he has been getting 
prolonged angina attacks at least 4 times a week. He has 
multivessel CAD and has been advised to undergo a CABG, but he 
has preferred to avoid surgery and has been managed medically. 
He takes clopidogrel, which he stopped four days prior to 
presentation due to a scheduled colonoscopy. On the day of 
admission, he presented to the pre-procedure area of the 
colonoscopy suite complaining of chest pain x 1 hour.  
 The procedure was cancelled, and the patient was given 
nitroglycerin and aspirin with some relief. He was sent to the 
ED.  
 In the ED initial vitals were:  
 98.1 HR: 100 BP: 144/84 Resp: 20 O(2)Sat: 99 Normal  
 Exam was unremarkable.  
 EKG was sinus tachycardia to 100bpm with ST elevations in aVR 
and ST depressions diffusely in other leads, new from prior.  
 A code STEMI was called and cardiology evaluated the patient. A 
repeat EKG minutes later notable for resolution of ST 
elevations. Patient asymptomatic. Posterior leads were negative. 
First troponin <0.01  
 Next steps were discussed with patient and he refused both CABG 
and cath and preferred medical management. He was placed on 
nitro and heparin gtts. The nitro gtt was d/c'd due to lack of 
symptoms, and he was transferred to the floor on heparin 800 
units/h.  
 Vitals on transfer: T 98.2 BP 192/92 HR 98 RR 18 O2 100% RA  
 On the floor, the patient confirms the above HPI. He denies 
chest pain, dyspnea, dizziness, presyncope, and edema. Notably, 
he skipped his usual morning meds ISO getting the colonoscopy, 
so has not had any of his usual meds today.  
 Repeat BP 160/80, HR 88. After further questioning, he is still 
declining CABG/Cath, but is thinking about it.  
 REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  
 Cardiac review of systems is notable for dyspnea on exertion, 
paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema, 
palpitations, syncope, or presyncope.  
 On further review of systems, denies any prior history of 
stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, 
bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, 
hemoptysis, black stools or red stools. Denies exertional 
buttock or calf pain. Denies recent fevers, chills or rigors. 
All of the other review of systems were negative.

proximal RCA disease. Bypass surgery has been recommended and  
 he has preferred to avoid. Has had a stable anginal pattern 
with chest  
 discomfort every month or so if he walks several blocks after  
 eating. Resolves promptly with a single nitroglycerin -no 
change  
 in pattern. He has found that if he takes the nitroglycerin

PERTINENT IMAGING AND PROCEDURES
===================================
Cath ___
Coronary Anatomy
Dominance: Right
LMCA: The LMCA was heavily calcified and long with a distal 40% 
stenosis..
LAD: The LAD was stump occluded proximally after a high D1. The 
LAD was heavily calcified. The modest caliber branching high D1 
had an origin 80% stenosis and a 75% stenosis at its distal 
bifurcation.
LCX: The proximal CX was heavily calcified. There was an ostial 
80% stenosis prior to a ___nd a small OM1. The 
proximal-mid CX had a S curve. The OM2 (after the S curve) had 
an origin
60-70% stenosis and supplied 2 tortuous distal poles. The distal 
AV groove CX after OM2 had disease to 70% and supplied a 
tortuous small LPL2.
RCA: The RCA was heavily calcified. The proximal RCA was 
diffusely diseased with a proximal 85% stenosis extending down 
to the mid RCA to 60%. The mid-distal RCA had a 50% stenosis. 
There were
collaterals from the RPDA to the apical LAD. RPL1 had 
mild-moderate diffuse disease to 40%. RPL2 was tiny. The distal 
AV groove RCA extended well up the LV and gave off a tortuous 
modest caliber RPL3.
There were multiple septal collaterals towards the LAD, but the 
calcified shell of the LAD was not well opacified, suggestive of 
serial total occlusions in the LAD.

Impressions:
1. Severe calcific three vessel coronary artery with a 
chronically (and likely serially) occluded LAD that
never filled well via collaterals, a doubly retroflexed proximal 
CX with an ostial stenosis, and diffusely
diseased RCA. The RPDA and the OM2/LPL1 are good targets for 
CABG. The heavily calcified LAD
is likely occluded in multiple locations.
2. Normal left ventricular end diastolic pressure in setting of 
known chronic LV systolic heart failure.
3. Tortuous right subclavian artery making catheter manipulation 
challenging.

Cardiac cath ___
Impressions:
1. Successful Impella supported PCI of the Cx with DES.
2. Unsuccessful PCI of the RCA.

L Groin ultrasound ___
No evidence of hematoma or fluid collection.  No pseudoaneurysm.

___ 07:50AM BLOOD Calcium-9.4 Phos-3.1 Mg-1.___ year old male with a history of multivessel CAD (LAD, LCX, 
D1, OM1, RCA; has refused CABG), HTN, DMII, who presented today 
to the ED with new onset chest pain radiating down both arms and 
STEMI on EKG. 

# CORONARIES: The ___ had distal 30% stenosis with origin 90% 
into the Cx which was severely tortuous with retroflexion and an 
S curve into a 70% stenosis into the OM. The LAD was occluded. 
The RCA was diffusely and heavily diseased to 90% and serial 70% 
lesions.

# PUMP: Per TTE ___: regional left ventricular systolic 
dysfunction with hypokinesis to akinesis of the mid septum, mid 
anterior, distal anterior, apical and distal inferior walls and 
hypokinesis of the basal inferior wall. The remaining segments 
contracted well (LVEF = 35-40%). 

# RHYTHM: NSR 

#STEMI: Patient has long history of stable angina and severe 
multivessel disease, for which he has been managed medically and 
has refused intervention. Followed by Dr. ___ as an 
outpatient, who has managed medically and refrained from further 
diagnostic workup ISO of refusal of procedures. Today presented 
with chest pain at rest and ST elevation in aVR, concerning for 
a STEMI in the left main/LAD territory. Symptoms resolved with 
ASA and nitroglycerin, and a repeat EKG showed resolution of ST 
elevations and depressions. First troponin negative. Patient 
still prefers medical management, and so was placed on heparin 
(at 800 units/h) and nitro drip in ED and transferred to floor. 
On home aspirin, statin. Plavix has been held for 4 days ISO 
colonoscopy. Hypertensive in ED and on transfer to floor in the 
setting of missing antihypertensive. On floor, ongoing patient 
initially refusing cath but agreed after extensive discussion 
with his family ___. Cath ___ showing severe calcific three 
vessel coronary artery with a chronically (and likely serially) 
occluded LAD, a doubly retroflexed proximal CX with an ostial 
stenosis. CT Surgery evaluation was subsequently initiated to 
determine potential candidacy for CABG. However, patient did not 
wish to undergo CABG. 

On ___ he underwent successful DES to LCx with impella support. 
Attempted intervention to RCA lesion but c/b dissection so no 
intervention performed to RCA. He had bleeding from L groin 
which resolved overnight. He was initiated on Plavix and 
continued ASA, Atorvastatin, and metoprolol.

#Hypertension: Has been hypertensive to SBPs in the 190s on 
admission, improved to 160/80s without intervention. SBP 
130-140s AM of ___, 110-140s on ___. His home amlodipine and 
losartan, metoprolol were continued.

#Diabetes: hx of DMII, on metformin and glipizide. Continued on 
ISS while in-house 

#CKD: History of CKD with Cr 1.3. Cr 1 on admission. 

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,

It was a pleasure caring for you at ___.

You came to the hospital because of chest pain. We found that 
you had blockages in several coronary arteries. You were 
evaluated by the cardiac surgery team for bypass surgery but you 
did not wish to have this. Therefore, we performed stenting of 
one of the arteries in your heart. You had some bleeding in your 
L groin that resolved.

IMPORTANT INSTRUCTIONS:
- ___ with your cardiologist in the next ___ weeks. 
- Continue taking all medications as prescribed.
- It's VERY IMPORTANT to continue taking clopidogrel and aspirin 
every day. These medications are keeping your new stent open. 
You should not stop these medications unless directed by your 
cardiologist. 
- Please watch for warning signs (see below) and if these 
develop call your doctor right away.

It was our pleasure caring for you. We wish you the best!

Sincerely,
Your ___ care team
