Brief Hospital Course:
___ G1 with IVF di/di twins admitted at 33+1wks with preterm 
contractions and oligohydramnios Twin A.
.
Mrs ___ was contracting irregularly on arrival to labor and 
delivery. Her cervix was 2cm/80% which was a change from her 
exam in the office, however, by a different examiner. There was 
no sign of infection. Fetal testing was reassuring and she was 
given a course of betamethasone for fetal lung maturity. Her 
cervix made no further cervical change and she went to the ATU 
for repeat ultrasound and MFM consult by Dr ___. Repeat 
ultrasound revealed subjectively low fluid around Twin A with 
only one 2 by 2 pocket and the membrane appeared tightly applied 
to Twin A. Twin A had normal umbilical Doppler study. He 
recommended reevaluating once she was betamethasone complete. 
She underwent continuous monitoring on labor and delivery with 
reassuring fetal testing. She was started on Nifedipine for her 
preterm contractions with good result. Her cervix remained 
unchanged. On hospital day #2, the patient complained of leaking 
fluid and preterm premature rupture of membranes was confirmed 
by speculum exam. She was started on antibiotics for latency 
antibiotics and the Nifedipine was discontinued. The decision 
was made to delier the patient when she was beta complete. Fetal 
testing was reassuring. Her contractions progressively 
intensified and she was delivered by primary low transverse 
cesarean section at 33+3 weeks gestation (___). She was 
betamethasone complete at the time of delivery. Twin A, liveborn 
male delivered from ___, 1915g, apgars 9 and 9. Twin B, 
liveborn male, 2050g, apgars 8 and 8. NICU staff was present for 
delivery and transferred both neonates immediately for 
prematurity. There were no intra-operative complications. Please 
see operative note for details. She had an uneventful postpartum 
course and was discharged home on POD#4.
