Micro:

Imaging:

- CTA Chest:
Extensive bilateral pulmonary emboli, involving the right main 
pulmonary artery and segmental branches on the left. No evidence 
of right heart strain or pulmonary infarction. 

- Bilateral Lower Extremity Ultrasound: 
Deep venous thrombosis within the left posterior tibial veins, 
and possibly within one of the peroneal veins. No DVT in the 
right lower extremity veins. 

- Cardiac echo:
The left atrial volume index is normal. Normal left ventricular 
wall thickness, cavity size, and regional/global systolic 
function (biplane LVEF = 62 %). Transmitral and tissue Doppler 
imaging suggests normal diastolic function, and a normal left 
ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg). Right ventricular 
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The diameters of 
aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels are normal. The 
aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good 
leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic 
regurgitation. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with 
trivial mitral regurgitation. There is no mitral valve prolapse. 
The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is high normal. 
There is no pericardial effusion. 

 IMPRESSION: Normal study. Preserved regional and global 
biventricular systolic function. No valvular pathology or 
pathologic flow identified. High normal estimated pulmoanry 
artery systolic pressure. 

 CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: 
 Based on ___ AHA endocarditis prophylaxis recommendations, the 
echo findings indicate prophylaxis is NOT recommended. Clinical 
decisions regarding the need for prophylaxis should be based on 
clinical and echocardiographic data.  
 
Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ is a ___ with morbid obesity, recurrent pregnancy 
loss, recent c/section ___, not breast feeding), who 
presented to ___ with leg swelling and dyspnea found to have 
LLE DVT and extensive PE involving the right main pulmonary 
artery and segmental branches on the left. 

#Submassive Pulmonary emboli
#DVT
Patient presented with left calf pain and swelling as well as 
worsening shortness of breath. She had a C-section on ___ 
and had also received Depo-Provera shortly after her child's 
birth. She notably also has a history of four spontaneous 
abortions. Her work up in the ED revealed LLE DVT (left 
posterior tibial veins, and possibly within one of the peroneal 
veins) and CTA revealed extensive bilateral pulmonary emboli, 
involving the R main pulmonary artery and segmental branches on 
the left without evidence of right heart strain. Vascular 
medicine was consulted and recommended initiation of 
anticoagulation with lovenox and warfarin. No need for 
thrombolysis. She underwent cardiac echo that showed normal LV 
wall thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic 
function. She was continued on lovenox and warfarin in the 
hospital. INR upon discharge was 1.2. Discharge dose of warfarin 
is 7.5 mg daily. 

#Type ___iagnosed with Type 2 DM in ___ and treated with NPH and 
Humalog during pregnancy. Upon admission, she was only using 
three units of Humalog with meals. Both her fasting and mealtime 
sugars were elevated. We spoke with her outpatient 
endocrinologist and increased her Humalog to 5 units with meals 
and resumed her previous NPH dose of 15 units with breakfast and 
dinner. Blood sugars improved, although did continue to be 
slightly elevated. She has follow up with ___ scheduled.

blood sugars and to adjust your insulin as needed.
-Please go to your primary care office on ___ to have your 
INR checked (blood test to see how that warfarin is working)
