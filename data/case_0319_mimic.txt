Imaging/Reports:

Cardiac Cath ___:
RCA with total occlusion distally before PDA. THe lesion was 
crossed with Choice ___, predilated with 2.0 balloon. 
Thrombectomy was done follwed by stenting with 3.25 mm DES and 
post dilated to 3.5 with 0% residual and normal flow.

Echo ___:
Conclusions
The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left 
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size. There is mild 
regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with 
inferior/inferolateral akinesis. The remaining segments contract 
normally (LVEF = 40%). Right ventricular chamber size is normal 
with borderline normal free wall function. The diameters of 
aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels are normal. The 
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic 
stenosis is not present. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The 
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral 
valve prolapse. An eccentric, posteriorly-directed jet of mild 
(1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary 
artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Mild regional biventricular systolic dysfunction, 
c/w CAD. Mild ischemic mitral regurgitation. Mild pulmonary 
hypertension. 

CXR ___:
Lungs clear.  Heart size normal.  Mediastinal and hilar 
silhouettes and 
pleural surfaces unremarkable. 

Micro:
None

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted with a heart attack, and taken emergently to 
the cardiac catheterization lab where a blockage was identified 
in the right coronary artery and stented. You recovered well 
from the procedure and you are now ready for discharge home. 

As discussed you will be given an updated list of your 
medications including Plavix (for the stent) which you will 
continue for a year and Aspirin for life. These drugs should 
only be stopped by your cardiologist. If taken correctly these 
drugs decrease your risk for another heart attack and 
hospitalization. 

You will also be given a perscription for nitro tabs which are 
taken under the tongue ONLY in the event you are having chest 
pain. You should also call your cardiologist or 911 if you start 
to have chest pain. This will lower your blood pressure and 
should not be taken if you have taken any drug for erectile 
dysfunction in the past 48 hours as it can then cause a 
dangerous drop in blood pressure. 

You have been scheduled to see your providers including your new 
cardiologist. 

You will be referred to cardiac rehab after seen and cleared by 
your cardiologist as an outpatient.

All other activity restrictions per nursing. 

It was a pleasure taking care of you this admission. If you have 
any questions related to your hospitalization feel free to call 
the heartline which has been given to you with your discharge 
paperwork.
