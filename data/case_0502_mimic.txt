Brief Hospital Course:
#Legal: ___
#Safety: remained on q15 min safety checks throughout with no 
behavior concerning for suicide or harm to others.

#Depression
The patient presented with depressed mood, low energy, anhedonia 
and low interest, and multiple somatic complaints with plan 
(reported to her PCP) to overdose on heroin (which she used 
previously) and end her life because of its purposelessness and 
the recent loss of her home.  On initial interview she was 
highly anxious, somatizing, and exhibited slowed and 
overinclusive speech consistent with depression NOS (adjustment 
d/o v MDD) and possible mild klonopin intoxication.

On admission the patient was taking remeron 30 mg HS, klonopin 2 
mg q6h, and tramadol.  The remeron was continued, klonopin was 
tapered from a total of 8 mg /day to 6 mg/day, and the team 
attempted to introduce effexor for improvement of depression.  
The patient frequently complained about the effexor stating that 
it caused blurred vision, dry mouth, burning of her skin, 
drowsiness, weakness in her legs, and joint pains and ultimately 
began to refuse it.

Throughout the patient's stay she was very somatically focused 
with frequent complaints (as above) about her medication.  She 
was also intitially irritable and standoffish with the team 
which improved through the course of her hospitalization.  By 
discharge the patient's suicidal thinking had resolved (with no 
further intent to overdose on heroin).  She reported better 
sleep and her speech appeared closer to a regular rate and 
rhythm with a much more linear (and less 
tangential/overinclusive) thought pattern.  She attributed her 
improvements to having found housing and made plans for ongoing 
care.

The patient refused any psychiatric or psychotherapy followup 
citing her rape by a psychiatrist in the ___; when offered a 
female psychiatrist or therapist she declined this as well.  She 
plans to followup with her PCP ___ ongoing care.  
Several calls were made to Dr. ___ (plus one email) 
but as of this writing team is still awaiting response; an 
appointment was scheduled for followup and Dr. ___ has 
access via OMR to the patient's notes and discharge summary.

#Heroin abuse in full remission
The patient has a history of heroin abuse in the past but has no 
evidence of recent use by history or toxicology screen.  She did 
consider commiting suicide by heroin overdose (in the past 
sniffed heroin) stating her friends can provide easy access to 
this.  Otherwise no issues surrounding substances of abuse.

#Diabetes
The patient had several glucose readings into the 200s and qid 
glucose checks with sliding scale insulin (low dose) was 
initiated.  Patient refused this and then refused all glucose 
checks.  Patient will follow up with her PCP on this issue.

Safety assessment: The patient presented with suicidal ideation 
with plan and intent to overdose on heroin.  During her stay 
modifiable risk factors that were addressed included:
housing - arranged for patient to have stable housing via social 
work
depression - stabilized on milieu, offered medication increase 
(refused) and therapy followup
suicidal ideation - patient's suicidal ideation resolved with no 
further intent or plan
social isolation - put patient in contact with sister and 
arranged for patient to do therapy intake (if she will agree to 
it)
Static risk factors include the patient's age, low functional 
status, and chronic mental illness.  Protective factors include 
the modifications above as well as absence of past suicide 
attempts, absence of active substance abuse issues.  The patient 
represents an appropriate level of risk for ongoing treatment in 
the outpatient setting.

Brief Hospital Course:
#Lightheadedness, dizziness, and SOB: The patient's symptoms are 
likely related to her known anxiety. They are highly unlikely to 
represent PE given normal D-dimer. ___ evaluated her and felt 
that she was safe to return home with ___.

#Headache: Her headache is likely benign in etiology. It is 
unlikely to represent temporal arteritis given lack of 
associated symptoms and slightly elevated ESR. It is highly 
unlikely to be aneurysm given negative CTA. She was started on 
Tramadol 50 MG PO Q8H PRN to some effect and was discharged on 
this with standing Tylenol. Of note, Mirtapine and Tramadol 
moderately interact with the risk of developing serotonin 
syndrome. She received several doses of Tramadol with no issue. 
Prior to D/C, she was given information about this rare risk.

#Chest pain: Her chest wall tenderness is likely musculoskeletal 
in origin given reproducibility with palpation. It is highly 
unlikely to represent ACS given unchanged EKG and negative Trop 
x2. She was started on Lidocaine patch to good effect and was 
discharged on this. She refused to undergo a stress test, and 
this will need to be done as an outpatient.

#Leukocytosis: Per PCP, her leukocytosis is a chronic issue. On 
admission, her WBC was 13.9, and on discharge, 15.4. Throughout 
her hospitalization, she remained afebrile with unremarkable CXR 
and UA. This issue will need to be followed-up by her PCP.

#Anxiety: Her home Clonazepam and Mirtazipine were continued.

#DM: Per OMR, her most recent A1C was 7.3. She endorsed 
polydypsia and increased frequency. This issue will need to be 
followed-up by her PCP.
