4.5cm mass posterior to the right lobe of the liver and separate 
from the pancreas. She had a follow-up CT abd/pelvis which 
showed a 3.2 x 3.1 cm RLL lung mass and a 4.9 x 3.7cm soft 
tissue mass in the upper abdomen just superior to the celiac 
trunk. Labs showed WBC count of 14.2, ALT/AST ___ ALP 106 and 
tbili of 1.0. She was given 4mg morphine x 2, IV Zofran and IVF. 
She then requested transfer to ___ for further care. 

In the ___ ED initial vitals were: 98.2 102 134/63 18 98% RA

- she was then admitted for further care

On the floor, patient is well. She is complaining of some gassy 
discomfort of her abdomen after drinking the contrast for her CT

Imaging:

___ CT second opinion read
IMPRESSION:
1. A 4.8 cm soft tissue mass superior to the celiac trunk may be 
an enlarged lymph node or a mass arising from caudate lobe of 
the liver, concerning for malignancy.  MRI may be helpful for 
further characterization.
2. Fibroid uterus.

___ CT chest
IMPRESSION: 
Lobulated pulmonary nodule in the right lower lobe is highly 
suspicious for
malignancy. Necrotic right hilar lymph nodes, borderline 
subcarinal lymph
node, and necrotic upper abdominal soft tissue mass.
 
Differential diagnosis includes primary lung cancer or atypical 
carcinoid with
metastatic disease to right hilum and upper abdomen, as well as 
pulmonary
metastatic disease from an extrathoracic primary.
 
The lobulated lesion in the posterior basal segment of the right 
lower lobe
would be amenable to image guided percutaneous biopsy.

___ MRI head
IMPRESSION
1. Paranasal sinus inflammatory changes.  Otherwise normal 
study.

___ CXR
IMPRESSION: 
No previous images.  Following biopsy of presumably the large 
mass in the
right mid to lower lung, there is no evidence of post procedure 
pneumothorax. 
The left lung is essentially clear.
 
Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ is a ___ woman with h/o DM and HLD who presents 
with abdominal pain and found to have new masses in her abdomen 
and lung, concerning for malignancy.

# New abdominal mass and lung mass
Concerning for metastatic cancer as this time. She had staging 
CT chest and MRI brain completed, which showed lesions confined 
to abdomen and chest. Tumor lysis labs were monitored daily and 
were not consistent with TLS. Serotonin, chromogranin, and urine 
5-HIAA were sent for carcinoid workup and are pending at 
discharge. Ultimately, ___ biopsied the RLL lesion, which patient 
tolerated well. Pathology pending at discharge and oncology will 
arranged for appropriate follow-up.

# Abdominal pain
Unclear etiology, but resolved upon admission to the hospital. 
Unlikely to be related to mass as pain and symptoms resolved. 
Perhaps due to gastroenteritis or gastritis. 

# Leukocytosis
Most likely reactive in setting of abdominal pain and stress. 
Improved at discharge to 7.4 without interventions. 

# T2DM: Home metformin and Januvia were held during admission 
and resumed at discharge. Patient managed with ISS while 
hospitalized.

# HLD: Home rosuvastatin continued.

> 30 minutes were spent on day of discharge care planning and 
coordination.

Transitional issues:
- serotonin, chromogranin and urine 5-HIAA pending at discharge
- final pathology read pending at discharge, oncology to follow 
results and arrange for appropriate follow-up
