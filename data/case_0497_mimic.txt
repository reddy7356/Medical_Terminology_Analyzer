IMAGING:

CXR ___: IMPRESSION:  No evidence of acute disease; however, 
suspicion for pulmonary 
nodules.  If recent cross-sectional imaging has not been 
performed to evaluate 
the chest, then chest CT evaluation would be appropriate.  No 
prior 
examinations are available at our institution. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ is a ___ gentleman with a recent diagnosis 
of metastatic HCC who presented on C2D6 from FOLFOX/Sorafenib 
with nausea, vomiting, and inability to tolerate PO.  

# N/V/D: Most likely secondary to recent chemotherapy. Low 
suspicion for infectious etiology such as Cdiff or 
gastroenteritis. Pt improved with IVF and home anti-emetics, 
which were continued. Tolerated a regular diet at discharge 
without N/V and improved diarrhea.

# Volume status: Presented hypovolemic in the setting of GI 
losses and poor PO intake. Improved with IVF and was euvolemic 
at discharge.
Looks essentially euvolemic now, came in hemoconcentrated (see 
below).

# Elevated Hct: Baseline recently 53, presented at 56 which 
likely represented  hemoconcentration. Per DFCI notes, 
consideration has been made for an EPO secreting tumor.

# HCC: Metastatic to lungs. C2D6 FOLFOX/sorafenib. Per pt there 
are not plans for surgery or TACE. Pain was well-controlled with 
home oxycontin.      

# HTN: Continued amlodipine 2.5 mg daily.

Transitional issues:
- Close oncology followup (arranged prior to discharge) where 
labs will be drawn and need for additional IVF will be assessed
- Followup final blood cultures
- Consider starting Bactrim for PCP prophylaxis and vitamin D 
for bone health if will be on dexamethasone long term
- Cont to work with patient on coping with difficult diagnosis
