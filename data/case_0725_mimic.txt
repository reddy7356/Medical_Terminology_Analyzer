Brief Hospital Course:
## Brain Abscess: Pt was admitted to ___ from an outside 
hospital following her history of altered mental status as well 
evidence of frontal bilateral masses. Pt underwent a CT scan and 
MRI which showed the appearance of cystic lesion. Pt was started 
on IV steroids and neurosurgery were consult. On the night of 
admission pt underwent an open bone flap and drainage to assess 
whether lesion was metastatic versus an infection. Pus was noted 
and drained noted to have brain abscess on biopsy/drainage 
performed on ___. Pt was then admitted and observed ___ the 
Neurosurgical ICU where she underwent a second procedure to 
remove her remaining rt sided lesion. Streptococcus Viridans was 
cultured and pt was started on a course of Vancomycin and then 
transitioned to Ceftriaxone per Infectious disease 
recommendations 2gm IV q 12hrs on ___. Per Neurosurgery 
recommendations pt was started on Keppra for seizure 
prophylaxis. Pt currently has two sutures ___ place at time of 
discharge, the largest will dissolve, the second will need to be 
removed during a follow up visit to Dr. ___ office on 
___ 11:30. Pt will need a repeat CT scan as an outpatient 
which has been scheduled for ___ 2:00, after CT head scan 
pt will see Dr. ___.  Pt will need a minimum of a 4 week 
course of Ceftriaxone 2gm IV q12hrs. Pt will have, during this 
duration, a follow up Infectious Disease Clinic appointment 
where they will decide whether she needs additional treatment.  
Pt underwent a TTE that did not show any endocarditis.  TEE was 
deferred as it would not change management and was felt to be a 
high risk 
procedure per our cardiology team.  The most likely etiology of 
her brain abscesses is seeding from her lung infection (see 
below) or from endocarditis.   

## Lung Lesion: Pt underwent a biopsy of lung mass recently that 
was positive for BOOP. As the possibility of malignancy still 
existed the pt's RUL mass went to the bronchoscopy suite where 
she underwent 6 biopsies, BAL, brush examination. Biopsies 
showed alveolar and peribronchial tissue with mixed inflammatory 
infiltrate, suggestive of acute pneumonia. Bronchial mucosa with 
mildly increased goblet cells and focal acute inflammation. No 
malignancy was identified. Pt was discharged with a 7 day 
steroid taper per Interventional Pulmonary.  Pt will f/u with a 
repeat CT chest with contrast scan on ___ ___ to check the 
RUL mass.  Results will be faxed to Dr. ___ will follow 
up with Dr. ___ on ___ 17:15.

##. Mobility: Pt had bone flap removed for abscess drainage. She 
will need to wear the helmet whenever she is mobile. She will 
later need a graft however this will not be performed until 
several months from now.

## Leukocytosis: Pt's WBC was noted to trend up and then down 
prior to discharge. Pt noted to have thrush as well as yeast ___ 
her urine. Pt was started on a 14 day course of oral 
Fluconazole.
- continue total 14 days Course of Fluconazole  

## Endometrial thickening: On CAT scan pt's endometrial lining. 
Recommend pt undergo a transvaginal U/S to evaluate endometrial 
thickening as an outpatient.  

## FEN: pt underwent bedside and swallow evaluation. Per speech 
and swallow recommendations pt was started and tolerated a soft 
diet with thin liquids.  

## Psych: Pt has history of bipolar disorder, for which she 
usually takes Thoridazine. After discussion with Neurosurgery it 
was decided that the Thoridazine would have a potential to 
interfere with the pt's neurological examination. Pt will be 
re-evaluated by Dr. ___ on ___, at that time a decision 
will be made whether Thoridazine can be restarted.
- Recommend discussing with Dr. ___ on ___an 
start her Thoridazine again.

long history of "nervous breakdowns". They began in the 1960s 
and had been previously instiutionalized.  Had previously been 
on lithium, but mroe recently was maintained on thioridazine x 
___ years.  This medication was discontinued on previous 
admission for her brain abscess.  Since then she has been 
paranoid - her daughter has tried to give her medications but 
the patient thought she was poisoning her so the daughter has 
had to hide the medications in applesauce.  
Over the last ten days the patient has developed sleeplessness, 
agitation, and a "hyped up mood". Per her daughter who lives 
with her these are the same symptoms she had in the past with 
her other breakdowns. The patient reports also having visual 
hallucinations. The daughter initially called the PCP after the 
patient had not slept for 3 nights and the PCP put her back on 
her thioridazine and has been titrating the medication up over 
the last week. The daughter thought the patient was improving, 
however, tonight when the patient was supposed to be sleeping 
the daughter woke to find her awake and thus brought her to the 
ED.

frontal vertex is unchanged since prior exam. Area of 
hypodensity within the left frontal lobe adjacent to it and area 
of craniotomy is unchanged in size since prior exam. Mildly 
increased soft tissue laterally is minimally increased and may 
represent increased granulation tissue. The ventricles and 
extra-axial spaces are unremarkable. Right frontal burr hole is 
again noted, unchanged. Previously seen material with multiple 
air bubbles filling left cranioplasty appears more homogeneous 
on the current study. There 
are no air bubbles within this region. There is no depressed 
skull fracture. The paranasal sinuses and visualized mastoid air 
cells are grossly clear. 
IMPRESSION: 
No acute intracranial abnormality on this non-contrast CT. 
Minimally 
increased soft tissue (likely granulation tissue) adjacent to 
the left frontal area of encephalomalacia. 
CXR ___:
FINDINGS: The study is somewhat limited secondary to AP portable 
technique. Within that limitation, no consolidation or edema is 
evident. There is mild tortuosity of the thoracic aorta. The 
cardiac silhouette is grossly within normal limits for size. No 
effusion or pneumothorax is noted. The visualized osseous 
structures are unremarkable. 
 
Brief Hospital Course:
ASSESSMENT & PLAN: ___ s/p crani for abscess - cultures grew s. 
viridans and completed 6 wks of ceftriaxone, s/p cranioplasty. 
Has not slept for 2 weeks and was started on Thioridazine by 
PCP. CT scan stable.  

# Mania: Patient's symptoms are consistent with mania. Organic 
causes for her current episodes was rule out with negative CXR, 
negative UA, and blood cultures were negative x 48 hours on her 
transfer to ___.  She had a repeat Head CT with 
neurosurgical evaluation for any changes and possibility of 
intervention.  After review of head Ct, the neurosurgical team 
felt no need for surgical intervention as there was no 
significant change in her Head CT.  Additionally, she remained 
afebrile, no leukocytosis on lab work.  Likely this episode of 
mania is related to her medication changes.  Psychiatry service 
was consulted for further managment of her thioridazine.  
Initially, there was discussion about changing her Keppra to 
another agent, but this was deferred to her future inpatient 
psychiatric hospitalization where she could be closely 
monitored.  Ambien was initiated per psychiatry recommendations 
to help her insomnia.  

#. H/O Brain abscess: As mentioned above, her CT was unchanged 
on admission.  Was evaluated by neurosurgery in ED who did not 
see any surgical indications.  Her scan was unchanged and her 
would site was healing well.  Keppra was continued.  Psychiatry 
recommended considering changing to depakote for possible mood 
stabalizing benifits but this was deffered and can be considered 
by psychiatry as an inpatient. 

# h/o lung asbcess: Had been seen by ID in the past in relation 
to this.  Was supposed to be scheduled for Chest CT in ___, but 
was not obtained.  In speaking with her PMD, this was 
rescheduled for ___ at ___.  

# h/o DVT: Had previously been on coumadin for ___ DVT, but had 
been discontinued after recent hospitalization.  Her PMD had 
repeated ___ Doppler study which showed NO DVT.  Thus, 
anticoagulation was discontinued.

#. COPD: Her outpatient medication is for Bonava, but 
unavailable at ___.  Asymptomatic and maintained normal oxygen 
saturation on room air.  She had albuterol as needed written for 
which she did not need. 

#. Hyperlipidemia: will continue simvastatin.  
  
#. Cataract: stable and continued outpatient regimen.

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted to the hospital because of insomnia and a 
manic episode.  You were evaluated for possible causes of your 
mania.  Our work up was negative.  We did not find an infection 
or any metabolic problems.  You had a head CT to evaluate the 
recent brain abscess.  It was reviewed with the neurosurgeons 
who did not see any changes from before.  Your mania is likely 
related to recent changes in your thioridazine.  

Medication changes:
Thriodidazine and Keppra were continued.  

Please return to the hospital or call your doctor if you have 
temperature greater than 101, shortness of breath, worsening 
difficulty with swallowing, chest pain, abdominal pain, 
diarrhea, or any other symptoms that you are concerned about.
