radiation to L 
breast p/w exertional chest pain and NSSTTW.  
  
SUMMARY OF EXERCISE DATA FROM THE EXERCISE LAB: 
Exercise protocol: Gervino 
Resting heart rate: 69 
Resting blood pressure: 132/78 
Exercise duration: 10.25 min. 
Peak heart rate: 147 
Percent max predicted HR: 89 
Peak blood pressure: 165/90 
Symptoms during exercise: none 
Reason exercise terminated: Fatigue 
ECG findings: Sinus with isolated VPB 
  
IMAGING METHOD: 
Stress and resting perfusion images were obtained on separate

INTERPRETATION: 
Resting and stress perfusion images reveal uniform tracer uptake 
throughout the 
myocardium.  Left ventricular cavity size is normal. 
  
Gated images reveal normal wall motion. 
The calculated left ventricular ejection fraction is 74%. 
  
IMPRESSION: Normal cardiac perfusion and wall motion with LVEF 
of 74%.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ is a ___ year old woman with a history of DMII, HLD, and 
breast cancer undergoing XRT to L breast who presented with 
chest pain. 

# Chest Pain: Differential included unstable angina versus 
stable angina versus non-cardiac chest pain. Multiple risk 
factors for CAD especially XRT, DM,HTN, and obesity. She was 
risk stratified with biomarkers and stress test with myocardial 
perfusion study. Biomarkers and stress test were unremarkable. 
It is likely that her chest pain was secondary to a 
musculoskeletal source. Her initial chest pain improved with 
aspirin 325 on arrival and did not recur during her admission.

# R ___ digit MCP Joint pain: Differential includes gout given 
elevated uric acid. ddx also includes osteoarthritis vs. 
dupatreyns contracture. Ms. ___ was trialed on colchisine which 
improved her pain. Further workup/treatment per PCP ___.

History of Present Illness:
This is an otherwise quite healthy ___ woman who 
underwent a lumpectomy and axillary dissection approximately 3 
weeks ago.  She had a positive lymph node FNA'ed under 
ultrasound; however, the axillary dissection
only showed 10 negative nodes; therefore, it was felt thatthe 
positive node had not been retrieved.  She was re-ultrasounded 
in the office with me and we did identify a node just inferior 
to the seroma cavity.  She is quite a large
woman with a BMI over 40 and initially the patient was reluctant 
to have more surgery and wished to just proceed with endocrine 
therapy and radiation but in the interim she decided she would 
like to have it excised so we proceeded.

taxol (___), who presents with nausea, vomiting, fatigue,
and was found to have hypotension to ___. 

Ms. ___ reports that she has had months of nausea, vomiting, and
abdominal discomfort that were ultimately worked up and found to
be from metastatic recurrence of breast cancer with liver 
lesions
in ___. More recently, she began taxol ___ and last received
this ___. A few days after C1D7 of taxol she had fatigue and
nausea with multiple episodes of emesis (nonbloody, occasionally
bilious) whenever she attempted to eat. Over these last 2 weeks
with chemotherapy, she feels she also has been greatly
deconditioned with dyspnea and intermittent cough productive of
white phlegm. She endorses lightheadedness whenever she got up

96.1, 100% on RA. Per ED report she was notably tachypneic to 32
and unable to complete sentences. Ms. ___ herself is not able to
give a clear report that this occurred. She received stress dose
hydrocort and 2 L NS with stabilization of BPs to
100s-130s/70s-90s.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear ___,

You were admitted with hypotension (low blood pressure) because 
of severe nausea and vomiting from your chemotherapy. You were 
treated with intravenous (IV) fluids, and felt much better -- 
you were able to keep down your meals as well. I discussed your 
case with Dr. ___ will see you as an outpatient.

You also complained of increased shortness of breath. Your CT 
scan did suggest pulmonary arterial hypertension; however, I got 
an ultrasound of your heart which was normal. Your shortness of 
breath was markedly improved with fluids alone.

You did have bacteria in your blood. Fortunately, this appears 
to have been a contaminant (that is, coming from your skin when 
your blood was drawn). You do not need any antibiotics for this.
