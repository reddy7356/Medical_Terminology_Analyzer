Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ was admitted to ___ on ___ for evaluation and 
management of his sudden-onset small-volume hemoptysis in the 
setting of renal cell carcinoma metastatic to the lung. He was 
on cycle 2, day 7 of Phase II study ___. His hospital course 
by problem is as follows:

1) Hemoptysis - Mr. ___ hemoptysis was attributed to 
progressive pulmonary renal cell carcinoma metastases. His 
history and symptoms were non-life threatening, yet particularly 
concerning for disease progression and/or drug reaction. He is 
on a phase II trial as above. A preliminary re-read of his CT 
from outside hospital identified mildly increased pulmonary 
nodule size. It was determined he would benefit from 
bronchoscopy to determine the source of his bleed. He underwent 
bronchoscopy on the afternoon of ___. The procedure 
identified a small area of slow bleeding in the lingula. This 
lesion was ablated. Additionally, 2 small non-bleeding nodules 
in the left upper lobe were prophylactically ablated. Neither 
the left lower lobe nor the lobes of the right lung demonstrated 
evidence of recent bleed.

2) URI - Patient's complaints of sinus congestion, cough 
productive of sputum, lack of fever, and exposure to family 
members feeling like they had a "cold" were attributed to viral 
respiratory infection. Thought to be an exacerbating factor 
causing hemoptysis, though not able to rule out disease 
progression versus drug reaction at this time. Encouraged PO 
intake.

# Metastatic RCC - Followed by Dr. ___. Stable throughout 
admission.

# NSTEMI with drug-eluting stent (___) s/p clopidogrel course 
and now on aspirin regimen. Aspirin held during hospitalization 
given recent hemoptysis. To be resumed upon discharge.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___, 

Thank you for choosing ___ for your medical care. You were 
briefly admitted on ___ for a bronchoscopy to control

coughing up blood. Your procedure was successful and did not 
have any complications. There was a very small nodule on the 
left side of your lung that was bleeding slowly. You had 2 small 
lesions in the left upper lobe of your lung that were also 
ablated to prevent future bleeding. There was no bleeding in 
your right lung.

Upon discharge, please keep all your scheduled appointments with 
Dr. ___ Dr. ___. Please resume your medications 
you were taking prior to arrival. You may continue to take 
aspirin. You may eat your normal diet.

Please call the Hematology-Oncology office at ___ or 
present to the emergency department if you experience any of the 
following: chest pain, palpitations, lightheadness or vertigo, 
worsening cough, coughing up blood, fever, chills, night sweats,
