___ 2:16 AM ~CHEST (PA & LAT)
INDICATION: Preoperative evaluation.
IMPRESSION: No acute cardiopulmonary process.
.
___ 3:20 AM ~CT ABDOMEN W/CONTRAST; CT PELVIS W/CONTRAST
HISTORY: ___ male with history of laparoscopic band 
placement with subsequent revision. Admitted for abscess around 
intra-abdominal tube. Now status post removal of infected 
gastric band and repair of erosion. Recently developed fever to 
102.5 and tachycardia. Concern for a leak or abscess.
IMPRESSION:
1. Extensive phlegmonous change around the lesser curve of the 
stomach and adjacent transverse colon. Small amount of 
extraluminal gas at this site may be related to recent surgery 
or infection. Long tubular phlegmonous tract with small amount 
of associated low-density fluid concerning for organizing 
abscess extends from stomach into the right pelvis. Appendix 
cannot be visualized separately from the area of pelvic 
phlegmon.
2. Multiple small locules of gas infiltrating the epicardial fat 
could be related to surgery but could indicate superior 
extension of infection.
3. Small left pleural effusion.
4. Small amount of gas within the urinary bladder. This would 
not be unusual if the patient has recently been catheterized 
with a Foley. However, if no Foley has been placed, findings are 
concerning for infection.
5. A few loops of mildly dilated small bowel in the upper 
abdomen are probably due to reactive ileus. No obstruction.
