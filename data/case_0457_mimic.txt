HIV
 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ year old male with PMH notable for major depressive disorder, 
multiple suicide attempts requiring inpatient hospitalizations, 
psoriasis, who presents with acute onset right sided facial 
paralysis involing the forehead.

# VII Nerve Facial Palsy: Unclear etiology, though the deficits 
found in the functions of the VII nerve with forehead 
involvement was suggestive of a peripheral nerve process, i.e 
facial nerve palsy/Bell's palsy. Differential for the VII nerve 
palsy included lyme disease (given patient's living situation in 
a wooded area), and patient was empirically started on IV 
ceftriaxone. Differential also included a viral source, such as 
VZV, CMV, HSV and HIV. In the ED, patient had an LP which showed 
normal WBC, RBC, glucose but elevated protein to 96. Neurology 
team was consulted who had high suspicion for lyme disease. ___, 
ESR and CRP were also sent to rule out inflammatory processes, 
and were all unremarkable. Central processes such as tumor, 
multiple sclerosis were considered unlikely given lack of 
headaches, visual changes, weakness, numbness in the 
extremities. Patient was not started on prednisone given time 
window as well as pending infectious workup. Patient was 
discharged on oral doxycyclyine for three week course for 
presumed lyme disease with lyme studies pending at the time of 
discharge. Labs to be followed by primary care physician, who 
will contact patient to discontinue antibiotic therapy if lyme 
results are negative. Will follow up with neurology as an 
outpatient.

#Hip/buttock pain: Patient's description of two week history of 
sharp pain in his right buttock radiating down to his calf 
suggested a peripheral radiculopathy e.g sciatica. It was 
unclear if this radiculopathy was related to the facial palsy.  
Patient will follow up with neurology for monitoring of 
symptoms.

#Depression/Anxiety/Bipolar disease: Per outpatient 
psychiatrist, Citalopram dose was doubled to 40mg daily.  
Continued Abilify and Clonazapem at home dose.
 
Transition of Care:
- Patient's PCP, ___ follow up on patient's pending 
labs and determine further treatment.
- Patient will also follow up with neurology as outpatient to 
monitor for resolution of symptoms.

History of Present Illness:
Mr. ___ is a ___ year old male with a history of major 
depression vs. bipolar disorder and two prior suicide attempts 
who presented to the ED yesterday with suicidal ideation and 
depression after being off psychiatric medications for 2+ weeks 
due to an increase in his copays a month ago. Because of this he 
started taking smaller doses of his remaining supply of Abilify 
(5 mg instead of 30 mg) to make it last longer. He ran out of 
Abilify about two weeks ago and ran out of Klonopin and Ambien 
about three weeks ago.  He has continued to take Celexa. Since 
changing the dose of his Abilify, he has noticed a gradual 
worsening of his mood.  About a week ago, he started having 
"dark thoughts" -- feeling like he wanted to end his life and 
wishing that "God would strike me down."  He denies having a 
specific plan.  He felt very nervous that he would act on these
thoughts, to the point that he felt somewhat nauseous and had 
trouble sleeping and eating.  He waited to contact his 
psychiatrist until ___ morning because he did not want to 
wait for a bed in the ED through the weekend.  He contacted his

psychiatric decline, which he felt was precipitated by inability 
to access ECT (which had been very effective for him in the 
past) and medications due to cost.  The patient thinks that he 
was doing "very well" five weeks ago when he was taking all his 
medications.  However, he has significant chronic stressors, as 
he is the primary caretaker for his elderly parents.  His father 
has been undergoing treatment for prostate cancer, and his 
mother was diagnosed with Alzheimer's three weeks ago.

On arrival to the inpatient unit, the patient describes "feeling 
safe and relieved" to be in an inpatient setting.  He endorses 
depressed mood, lack of energy, decreased motivation, and 
decreased sleep since stopping Ambien and Abilify.  He has an 
abnormal sleeping pattern at baseline, usually staying up all 
night wanting TV, falling asleep in the early AM and then waking 
up throughout the day, but he states that his sleep has been 
worse while off medications.  He has not had any visual/auditory 
hallucinations and his appetite is unchanged except as above.

Brief Hospital Course:
PSYCHIATRIC

#) DEPRESSION WITH SUICIDAL THOUGHTS

Pt presents with recurrent depression manifested by the 
following upon arrival to the unit:
-low mood
-anhedonia (previously had friends, job and social life- now 
secludes and rarely goes out of his home.  Seen on the unit to 
be withdrawn, dysphoric despite attendance at groups - did not 
appear to be taking pleasure out of activities)
-guilt and low esteem (pt feels embarassed and shamed over his 
decline from professional status to unemployment and living with 
parents)
-anergia 
-pmr (pt had reported that prior to hospitalization he mostly 
lie in bed x 18 hrs/day)
-suicidal thoughts (pt with active thoughts of overdosing and 
killing himself)

We determined that although the above sx were undoubtedly 
perpetuated by monthly cocaine use x appx ___ years, the pt 
seemed to have an organic, severe, and recurrent depression.  
Upon collateral from pt's outpt providers and Dr. ___, 
___ had done well in the past with ECT.

The team initiated ECT treatments for Mr. ___ which began on 
___.  On his first tx was difficult to induce a seizure, so 
we decreased his standing dose of Klonopin to 0.5mg TID.  Mr. 
___ had a total of 5 ECT treatments prior to discharge.  He 
tolerated the treatments well with no cognitive decline and 
signficant mood improvement marked by the following; slightly 
brighter affect, lack of suicidal thoughts, more interest in the 
future and socialization.  

In addition to ECT, we increased Celexa to 40mg daily.  The pt 
was reminded of risks including but not limited to; sedation, 
and sexual changes.  Due to an intolerable tremor (LUE>RUE) we 
discontinued his abilify. At time of discharge, patient still 
had mild LUE tremor which he reported existed prior to starting 
Abilify. 

Mr. ___ was given information about MAOIs and their benefits 
in patients with treatment refractory depression.  Although this 
medication is currently contraindicated given his co-morbid 
cocaine use and potential for labile blood pressures, we advised 
Mr. ___ that in the future, if he achieved sobriety and could 
follow strict dietary restrictions, an MAOI could possibly be 
considered by the outpatient team.  

In summary, Mr. ___ mood slightly improved during his 
hospitalization but he still lacked some spontaneity, while his 
affect was brighter it was still not completely reactive.  He 
denied si and acknowledged that the team can't read his mind and 
failure to reveal such thoughts could lead to a poor outcome and 
his own health risk. He remained disheveled on the unit and 
became focused on d/c as opposed to reviewing his initial 
presentation and plans to get better.  

#) H/O NON-COMPLIANCE
One day, Mr. ___ surprised the team by announcing in the AM 
that he had called his parents to pick him up and take him home. 
 Although we had agreed to d/c him the following day, Mr. ___ 
said that he decided it was time for him to leave and he 
couldn't stay another day.  After disclosing to us that he had 
lied about a plan to travel with his parents to ___ for 
___, he shared his thoughts that he was not benefiting 
from hosptialization and preferred to go home.  Since his 
parents are elderly and travelled over an hour to come to the 
hospital, he was adamant we d/c him home.  The pt then later 
revealed that he had legal troubles and a court date for 
___ which he wanted to attend to.  He refused to give us 
any further details.  Since we were going to d/c him the 
following day, and he was safe, we saw no reason to keep him 
hospitalized further despite our surprise at his impromptu d/c 
plan.  We met with his family and firmly gave our opinion that 
the pt must f/u as directed to assure success with his tx of 
depression. 

#) COCAINE ABUSE
The pt reported using about $40/month of cocaine.  He was warned 
of the dangers of drug use in terms of CV events, death, and 
worsening depression. Pt was receptive to this information along 
with our recommendation that he engage in AA/NA for sobriety.  
On the unit, he did attend these groups and remained open to 
considering outpatient referrals for cont'd help with sobriety.  


#) DEPENDENT PERSONALITY TRAITS
Pt exhibited significant dependence on his family for support 
and meeting daily needs.  He has little motivation to detach 
from his core unit, although circumstances may dictate that he 
needs to gain independence in the near future, which could be 
further destabilizing for him.
Pt has some insight into his "co-dependency" with his family

GENERAL MEDICAL CONDITIONS
#) H/O BELLS PALSY - no acute issues on the unit

PSYCHOSOCIAL

#) COLLATERAL
-Records were sought from ___ where the pt was 
hospitalized ___ years ago
-Dr. ___ has treated the pt before with ECT 
provided information that ECT was highly beneficial to the 
patient.  The problem in the past, however, was that upon d/c 
from the hospital, the pt did not f/u with outpt maintenance.

#) FAMILY CONTACT
-Pt's father, ___, was informed of the pt's progress 
throughout his hospital stay.
-Due to the pt's cocaine use in the home, and his parents being 
elderly, we had some concerns for elder abuse.  ___ assisted 
us in contacting the pt's family who reported no concerns for 
their safety and we did not file with elder services.
-Prior to discharge, a family meeting was held with the care 
team, the patient, and the patient's parents.  The prognosis and 
the need for ongoing treatment were reinforced with the parents.

#) INTERVENTIONS
A DMH (dept of mental health) application was filed for the 
patient with his consent.  Specific interventions that we are 
hoping for include:
-case management (pt faces financial troubles and possible 
housing difficulties in about 6 months as his parents are 
selling their house and moving to assisted living)
-vocational /job training (the pt has a h/o working at a high 
level and would likely feel a great sense of pride and 
accomplishment if he were to return to the workplace) 
-psychiatry/therapy services
-socialization via a day program/clubhouse
-community based flexible support person (pt needs support 
around sobriety and would benefit from a sponsor and information 
about AA/NA)

#) GROUPS/MILIEU
-The pt attended most groups on the unit.  He initially went to 
the groups despite appearing apathetic and withdrawn.  After 
receiving ECT tx, he interistingly showed less motivation for 
groups and started to minimize the importance of 
hospitalization.

LEGAL STATUS
Pt remained on a CV throughout the duration of the 
hospitalization

RISK ASSESSMENT
This pt has a chronically elevated risk of suicide, although his 
immediate risk has been significantly reduced.  
Risk factors include: major depression that is severe and 
recurrent, history of multiple suicide attempts, co-morbid 
substance abuse, h/o non-compliance with follow-up, is 
unemployed, single, and lacks much socialization.  He is also 
facing possible homelessness and financial crisis within the 
next six months.

To reduce his risk, we have established the pt with DMH 
services, treated his depression with ECT and inc'd dose of SSRI 
(which has shown great benefit), and educated the pt about the 
dangers of drug use in terms of worsening his depression.  We 
have also given him considerable education about the importance 
of cocaine abstinence and have recommended AA/NA meetings.  Mr. 
___ parents collected him on the date of discharge and are 
aware of his depression and need for close f/u with outpt and 
ECT maintenance.  There are no weapons at home, and everyone 
agreed that he seemed safe for discharge. 

At the time of discharge, Mr. ___ is still dysphoric but 
improved from the acute depressive episode leading to 
hospitalization.  His prognosis is guarded given his h/o 
noncompliance/recurrent depression/failure to go to maintenance 
ECT.  Should he comply with treatment, however, he would have a 
very favorable prognosis and we have educated him about such.

discussed with the patient our recommendation to simplify the
