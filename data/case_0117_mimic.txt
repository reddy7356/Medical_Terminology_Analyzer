Pelvic US ___:
IMPRESSION:
1. The patient deferred transvaginal examination. Endometrium 
not
definitively visualized though area thought to represent 
endometrium appears homogeneous and measures 3 mm.
2. Significantly enlarged left ovary with a 2.3 cm simple cyst. 
Given
postmenopausal state, this is concerning for malignancy. Could 
be better
evaluated with a transvaginal examination if patient amenable at 
later date or possibly MRI. Recommend GYN consult/referral.

Pelvic MRI ___:
IMPRESSION:
1. Solid-appearing ovarian mass measuring 2.7 x 2.2 cm in the 
left ovary.
Vascularity not assessed without intravenous contrast.
2. 2.2-cm cyst in left ovary.
3. Fibroid uterus.

5. 4-cm heterogenous lesion in the right iliac bone may 
represent a
previously treated lesion; correlation with prior imaging would 
be extremely helpful.
6. Heterogenous soft tissue deposit adjacent to the coccyx 
incompletely
evaluated on this study but could represent either a resolving 
hematoma or a hemorrhagic metastasis. Again correlation with 
previous imaging is essential.

 
Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ is a ___ year olf femaleinitially admitted to the 
Internal Medicine service at ___ for management of ESRD and 
further work up of a vaginal mass/bleeding. Gyn Oncology was 
consulted regarding the vaginal mass and she subsequently 
underwent an examination under anesthesia, laparoscopic
bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy by Gyn Onc and excision of 
suburethral mass by Urology. Please see Dr. ___ 
report for further details regarding the procedure. Ms. 
___ brief hospital course is as follows:

# Vaginal Mass/Bleeding: Patient was monitored with q6 Hct 
initially, which were stable in the mid to high ___ after 
transfusion of 1U of PRBCs. Patient had no acute episodes of 
bleeding. Imaging studies revealed a left ovary with a 2.3 cm 
simple cyst but did not further characterize the vaginal mass. A 
CA-125 was checked and found to be 10. Through consultation with 
the gyn/onc team, the patient was prepped for a biopsy under 
anesthesia to better characterize the mass. On ___, Ms. 
___ underwent an exam under anesthesia which revealed a 
posterior urethral mass which was resected by urology. The 
Gyn-Oncology team performed a laparoscopic
bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy. Final pathology was pending at 
discharge. Ms. ___ will follow up with her outpatient 
oncologist and Dr. ___. 

# Metastatic RCC s/p nephrectomy: Pa  Following discussions with 
the hematology and oncology team, the decision was made to hold 
the patient's Votrient (as prescribed by outpatient oncologist) 
given the side effect of bleeding.  Efforts were also made to 
obtain Votrient from the patient's nephew. 

# CAD s/p CABG: was stable during admission on home regimen. 
Held ASA given bleed.  We continued Amlodipine, Hydralazine, 
Metoprolol, Crestor, although hydralazine dose was reduced. 
Despite previous INR report, following discussion with 
outpatient provider, Dr. ___, patient is not on coumadin.

renal failure.  Patient was continued on a diabetic diet with 
ISS.

# Hypothyroidism: Stable, continued levothyroxine while 
inpatient.

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted for further evaluation of a vaginal mass. This
