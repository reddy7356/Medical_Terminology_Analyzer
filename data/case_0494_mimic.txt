ORGANISMS/ML.

___ CT HEAD WITHOUT CONTRAST
FINDINGS:  There is no evidence of acute intracranial 
hemorrhage, edema, mass effect, or infarction.  Prominent 
ventricles and sulci suggest age related involutional changes or 
atrophy.  Periventricular white matter hypodensities are 
consistent with chronic small vessel ischemic disease.  The 
basal cisterns appear patent and there is preservation of 
gray-white matter differentiation.  
No fracture is identified.  Visualized paranasal sinuses, 
mastoid air cells, and middle ear cavities are clear.  The 
globes are intact.   
IMPRESSION:  No acute intracranial process.   

___ CXR
FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained. 
 The cardiac silhouette is top normal.  Mediastinal contours are 
unremarkable.  No focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or 
evidence of pneumothorax is seen.  Slight prominence of the hila 
most likely relates to pulmonary vascular engorgement.  There 
are degenerative changes along the spine.  
IMPRESSION:  Central pulmonary vascular engorgement. 

___ & ___ ECG
Normal sinus rhythm. Right axis deviation. Right bundle branch 
block.

___ Transthoracic Echo
Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved 
regional and global biventricular systolic function. No 
pathologic flow or structural cardiac cause of syncope 
identified.

DISCHARGE LABS:

MCV-94 MCH-29.8 MCHC-31.7 RDW-14.8 Plt ___

___ 06:15AM BLOOD Calcium-10.0 Phos-3.4 Mg-1.___ with DM2, HTN, hypothyroidism with history of multiple 
recent falls-mechanical and syncopal-, who presents with several 
weeks of dizziness with walking and elevated blood sugars, and 
was discovered to have a UTI.

ACUTE ISSUES
#Syncope and presyncope- Patient endorses dizziness worse early 
in morning and worse with walking.  One prior syncopal episode 
on ___ with loss of consciousness and fall to ground with head 
strike. No evidence of cardiopulmonary etiology, euvolemic on 
exam, no symptoms while in-house.  TTE showed "Mild symmetric 
left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved regional and global 
biventricular systolic function. No pathologic flow or 
structural cardiac cause of syncope identified." EF>60%. Patient 
was not found to be orthostatic.  Telemetry showed normal sinus 
rhythm.  Etiology may be related to recent hyperglycemia in 
setting of steroid injection for hip vs urinary tract infection. 


#UTI- Patient had UA suggestive of UTI. Urine culture (prelim) 
grew E coli >100,000 organisms/mL. She denied any dysuria or 
suprapubic tenderness, although she did have presyncope. She 
received ciprofloxacin 250mg x1 in ED. Nitrofurantoin was 
contraindicated given her renal failure. She received one dose 
of ceftriaxone, before this was switched to cefpodoxime, to 
complete 7-day total course for complicated UTI (last dose 
___.

#Hypertension- HCTZ was discontinued given concern for 
hypovolemia. Lisinopril was increased from 10mg to 20mg daily. 
Felodipine was continued. Patient was intermittently 
hypertensive during hospital course, but blood pressure improved 
by time of discharge. There were no hypotensive measurements 
recorded.

CHRONIC ISSUES:
#Asthma- continue home Albuterol Inhaler PRN 
#Diabetes- Held glimepiride and started ISS. Resumed glimepiride 
on discharge.
#Gout- continue home Allopurinol
#Hypothyroid- continue home Levothyroxine Sodium 
#Allergies- continue home Fluticasone nasal

# CODE: Full code, confirmed
