He first noticed red-tinged urine 2 days ago. The shaking began 
___ days ago, first noticed when he was holding the telephone to 
his ear and couldn't keep it still with his right hand and had 
to switch hands. He fell once this morning as a result of the 
shaking making him unsteady, but denies any trauma to the head, 
or any loss of consciousness or dizziness.  This has never

IMAGING: 

Renal US as outpatient (Atrius, ___: clear renal cyst in 
upper pole of R kidney, no cholelithiasis, no focal liver 
abnormality seen.

NCHCT (___):
NON-CONTRAST HEAD CT:  A portion of the study was repeated due 
to patient motion. There is no acute hemorrhage, mass effect, or 
loss of gray/white matter differentiation to suggest an acute 
large vascular territorial infarction.  Multiple foci of 
hypoattenuation within the corona radiata and periventricular 
white matter are suggestive of chronic small vessel ischemic 
disease.  The ventricles are mildly large due to age appropriate 
atrophy.  Suprasellar and basilar cisterns are not compressed.  
The bones are unremarkable.  Visualized paranasal sinuses and 
mastoid air cells are well aerated. 
IMPRESSION:  No evidence of an acute intracranial process.

Renal/bladder US (___): Final
IMPRESSION:  Minimally complex right renal cortical cyst.  No 
evidence of hydronephrosis or source of hematuria identified.
 
Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ is an ___ yo man with a history of DMII complicated by 
chronic renal insufficiency stage II, HTN, HepC, and a history 
of prostate cancer s/p radiation, who presents with gross 
hematuria and shaking, found to have a UTI/severe urosepsis.

ACUTE CARE:  
# Severe urosepsis: UA in the ED was consistent with a UTI 
(+leuk, WBC >182, many bacteria). Spiked a fever around 1700 on 
___, with T 103, RR 28, WBCs 13, and HR 103, meeting 
criteria for SIRS, and urosepsis with the UTI as a source. 
Considered severe as there was a change in mental status 
associated and end organ damage (___). Continued with fevers for 
2 days after starting ctx, so concern for pseudomonal bacteremia 
led to broadening with Zosyn, but cultures and sensitivities 
came back revealing pansensitive E coli. Fevers resolved, and 
Mr. ___ continued to be afebrile when transitioned to PO 
ciprofloxacin. Will need to follow up with blood cultures and 
will continue with cipro for a total of 14 days from last 
negative blood culture (___).

# Acute on chronic kidney injury: Creatine level noted in the ED 
to be 4.5, up from the patient's baseline of 1.9, last check in 
___. On ___, the patient experienced a significant change in 
mental status, with large amplitude muscle jerks, inattention, 
and clonus. No evidence of encephalopathy as this episode was 
noted to be a transient change in mental status, and serum lytes 
were normal. Clinical picture, fevers, and UTI/urosepsis is most 
consistent with a prerenal cause precipitating ATN, in the 
setting of ACEI and NSAID use at home. Additionally, the urine 
chemistry and osmolality was more consistent with an 
interstitial process, in addition to the prerenal hypovolemia, 
lending credibility to ATN precipitated by hypovolemia. After 
IVF, creatinine has been slowly improving, consistent with some 
degree of ATN. In light of his CKD as well as his ___ hold 
ACEI, metformin, and NSAIDs at home, as these likely contributed 
to his renal failure. Will follow up with PCP for further 
management and appropriate choice of alternative medications 
given his kidney function.

# Gross hematuria: Mr. ___ noted red urine for ___ days prior 
to admission. Renal and bladder ultrasound were obtained which 
showed minimally complex right renal cortical cyst with no 
evidence of hydronephrosis or bladder thickening/masses. His 
hematuria improved while his UTI was being treated with 
antibiotics, which makes the infection as the most likely 
etiology. Given his radiation history of the area for prostate 
CA, he is likely to have friable, ectatic vessels, predisposing 
him to worse hematuria with the added insult of the UTI. At 
discharge, he had no gross hematuria, but microscopic evidence. 
On microscopic examination of the urine, no dysmorphic RBCs to 
suggest GN. Differential also includes possible malignancy given 
his history of prostate cancer and his age. Urine cytology was 
sent and appointment with urology for cystoscopy was arranged. 
His PSA was last checked on ___ and it was 0.6 and no 
nodules were felt on prostate exam.  

# Anemia: The patient's anemia is chronic, with hct in ___ of 
27.4 with MCV of 7.9 consistent with iron deficiency anemia. His 
iron studies in ___ are also consistent, with low ferritin and 
high TIBC. Ferritin as an inpatient is also low, with low serum 
iron, normal TIBC, normal transferrin, and low transferrin sat 
(5.6%), consistent with an iron deficiency anemia. Guaiac in the 
ED was negative, so less concern for other sources of bleeding 
causing acute drop in hematocrit, as there is already a 
convincing source with his gross hematuria. He was transfused 2 
units of blood (admission Hct was 19.8) during admission and Hct 
improved to 23. 
Chronic anemia is likely secondary to long standing iron 
deficiency and more acutely to hematuria, worsening in turn the 
preexisting iron deficiency anemia. He was started on iron 
supplements while in the hospital to address his iron deficiency 
anemia. The low ferritin in the setting of severe sepsis is 
concerning for additional source of bleeding, as ferritin is an 
acute phase reactant and expected to be high in this setting. 
Last colonoscopy was in ___ and only finding was polonic 
polyps. In light of his chronic iron deficieny anemia and the 
concern for malignancy, recommend a diagnostic colonoscopy 
sooner, within the next month.

# Confusion/myoclonus: On ___, Mr. ___ was confused when he 
spiked a fever at 1700 on ___. He has a blown L pupil (appears 
to be chronic, since his eye surgery), and he was also acutely 
very confused with evident inattention on mental status exam. 
His myoclonic jerks/tremors were also much worse, with 
hyperreflexia with sustained clonus in the brachioradialis 
reflexes. Possible rigors on top of his noted muscle jerks on 
admission. A CT Head was obtained showing no acute changes. 
Episode was likely related to his urosepsis, as his mental 
status change was transient and improved with downtrending fever 
after antibiotics and acetaminophen treatment. He had no other 
episodes of mental status change during his hospitalization.

# Tremor/myoclonus: The patient had a postural as well as 
action/intention tremor in UEs on exam, without tremors at rest. 
At times, appeared more like myoclonic jerks especially when he 
was febrile. He improved with treatment of his UTI, with only 
slight evidence of a tremor after significant time with arms 
held outstreched during discharge. Given abrupt presentation in 
setting ___ and urosepsis, likely secondary to this process. 
We got TSH and free T4 levels, as hyperthyroidism can 
precipitate tremors, but his TSH was only minimally decreased, 
and his free T4 was normal. Additionally, tremor continued to 
improved as his urosepsis has been treated. He was evaluated by 
___ on the day of discharge, as his tremors had led to a fall the 
day of admission, and found to be more stable with a walker than 
with his cane. He will continue with home ___ to improve 
ambulation.

# Lymphocytopenia: WBC has been elevated and continues to be 
elevated to 12.6 despite treatment and improving clinical 
picture. His differential also had low lymphocytes, which 
persisted during his hospital stay (around 5-6%). An HIV Ab was 
sent, and found to be negative. It is unclear what the etiology 
is, and if this is an acute finding, or more chronic. Arranged 
for follow up with his PCP as an outpatient to ensure resolution 
of leukocytosis and recheck his WBC differential for workup of 
lymphocytopenia (may need blood smear).

# High AG metabolic acidosis: Initially found to have a 
metabolic acidosis with an anion gap on admission. Now resolved 
with a bicarbonate of 25. This was likely ___ uremia. There was 
also concern for significant sepsis with hypovolemia, so there 
is likely an element of hypoperfusion with lactic acidosis, as a 
lactate level was 2.2.

CHRONIC CARE:
# DMII: Last HgA1c was 5.8 in ___. Will hold metformin and 
lisinopril. The patient was started on sliding scale while 
inpatient with daily finger sticks in the AM. Given CKD, and 
baseline Cr 1.9, should not be on metformin. For now, given his 
HbA1c is in a good range, will hold metformin and recommend 
follow-up with PCP for further management, as sulfonylureas are 
worrisome for hypoglycemia, and metformin is contraindicated 
with his renal function. Will continue to hold lisinopril given 
resolving ___.

# HTN: Per discussion with pharm rep, HCTZ is not an ideal drug 
for this patient given his baseline Cr of 1.9 and GFR of 29.5. 
He was discontinued of all antihypertensives while he was 
hospitalized since his blood pressures were in the 100s-110s 
systolic while here. 

# OA of left knee: The patient did not complain of any pain 
while here, but he had only been ambulating minimally. He is on 
chronic NSAIDs at home (nabumetone 750mg daily). As this is 
contraindicated in renal insufficiency, we discontinued it. He 
received a steroid injection on ___ so will hold off on 
pain meds for now, and have him follow up with ortho and PCP for 
pain management if needed.

# Glaucoma: Continued with latanoprost, pilocarpine, 
dorzolamide, and brimonidine.

# Prostate Cancer: Last PSA was 0.6 on ___. He continued 
with tamsulosin. 

# Hepatitis C: Last LFTs checked on ___ and were normal, 
AFP was 8.1. Abdominal ultrasound of ___ with no sign of 
cirrhosis. LFTs were checked while in hospital, and all were 
within normal limits, with only a slight elevation of AST, and 
high LDH.  A viral load was 4,989,635. These findings were 
similar to those reported in ___ during a follow up for the 
patient's HCV. Per atrius note, patient not previously treated 
because thought to not have significant response to medication. 
Will follow up with his PCP. 

# HLD: Continued with simvastatin. 

# GERD: Continued with omeprazole.

TRANSITIONAL CARE:
- Holding Nabumetone, ACEI, metformin, and thiazide, given CKD 
and his recent ___
- restarting amlodipine 5mg, please follow up for possible 
increase now that off the thiazide and ACEI
- Please follow up with diabetes management as discontinuing 
metformin 
- please evaluate knee pain as holding NSAIDs for now due to ___ 
(received steroid injection on ___
- Patient has appointment scheduled for nephrology and urology. 
Likely needs cystoscopy 
- please follow up with blood cultures and urine cytology
- please repeat UA to evaluate persistence of 
microscopic/macroscopic hematuria
- follow up with resolution of tremors
- recheck creatinine levels (3.1 at discharge, baseline is 1.9)
- please arrange for diagnostic colonoscopy by next month due to 
concern for malignancy in the setting of chronic iron deficiency 
anemia. Recheck hematocrit to ensure it continues to remain 
stable. 
- recheck CBC for low lymphocyte count, may need further work up 
with blood smear 
- patient instructed to complete 14 days of antibiotic treatment 
from last negative culture (last day on ___

INDICATION:  ___ year old man with ataxia and CT head concerning 
for watershed 
infarct.  Evaluate for acute infarct. 
  
TECHNIQUE:  Three dimensional time of flight MR arteriography 
was performed 
through the brain with maximum intensity projection 
reconstructions. 
  
Dynamic MRA of the neck was performed during administration of 
16 mL of 
Multihance intravenous contrast. 
  
Brain imaging was performed with sagittal T1 and axial FLAIR, 
T2, gradient 
echo and diffusion technique. 
  
Three dimensional maximum intensity projection and segmented 
images were 
generated. This report is based on interpretation of all of 
these images. The 
examination was performed using a 1.5T MRI. 
  
COMPARISON:  ___ noncontrast head CT. 
  
FINDINGS:  
  
Study is moderately degraded by motion.

midline shift 
or infarction.  There is prominence of the ventricles and sulci 
suggestive 
involutional changes.  Extensive periventricular, pontine and 
subcortical T2 
and FLAIR hyperintensities are noted, which may represent small 
vessel 
ischemic changes. 
  
MRA brain:  Evaluation of the M2 and distal middle cerebral 
artery arteries is 
limited secondary to motion degradation.  Within limits of 
study, a 
intracranial vertebral and internal carotid arteries and their 
major branches 
appear grossly patent. 
  
MRA neck:  The common, internal and external carotid arteries 
appear normal.  
There is no evidence of internal carotid artery stenosis by 
NASCET criteria.  
The origins of the great vessels, subclavian and vertebral 
arteries appear 
normal bilaterally.

without intravenous contrast.  Coronal and sagittal reformations 
were also 
performed. 
  
DOSE:  Acquisition sequence: 
   1) Stationary Acquisition 4.0 s, 15.1 cm; CTDIvol = 45.3 mGy 
(Head) DLP = 
684.4 mGy-cm. 
 Total DLP (Head) = 684 mGy-cm. 
  
COMPARISON:  ___ noncontrast head CT. 
  
FINDINGS:  
  
In the watershed region of the right MCA/PCA territories, is 
loss of cortical 
gray-white differentiation.  There is no evidence of hemorrhage 
or large mass. 
Periventricular and subcortical white matter hypodensities are 
nonspecific, 
but likely represent chronic small vessel ischemic disease.  
Prominence of the 
ventricles and sulci is suggestive of involutional changes. 
  
No fracture seen. The imaged portion of the paranasal sinuses, 
mastoid air 
cells, and middle ear cavities are clear. The imaged portion of 
the orbits are 
unremarkable.  Soft tissue densities are noted within bilateral 
external 
auditory canals which may represent cerumen. 
  
IMPRESSION: 
  
  
1. Loss of gray-white differentiation in the watershed region of 
the right 
MCA/PCA territories concerning for acute to early subacute 
infarct.  If 
clinically indicated, brain MRI may be obtained for further 
evaluation. 
2. No evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage.

UTIs (last UTI documented in ___, HTN, DM, CKD stage III, 
admitted with fever, leukocytosis, with exam and laboratory data 
consistent with UTI and LLE cellulitis. Patient reports chronic 
___ edema and per Atrius records, has been on Torsemide 20 mg in 
the past, no ECHO noted in chart. Given concerns for acute or 
subacute stroke on CT, MRI/MRA was done on ___ with no acute 
findings noted. He was monitored on telemetry, started on 
aspirin 81 mg daily, and ECHO was ordered to complete stroke 
work-up and to assess EF given unilateral leg edema. If his 
unilateral leg edema persists, would consider CT abdomen/pelvis 
for additional etiologies of leg edema as outpatient. 

#Sepsis
#UTI
#LLE cellulitis
The patient presented febrile, tachycardic, and with 
leukocytosis and evidence of infection ___ LLE cellulitis and 
positive UA. Urine CX had pan-sensitive proteus. His LLE 
cellulitis improved with IV CTX/Vanco. He was transitioned to PO 
Bactrim/Keflex to complete a 7 day course of antibiotics. 

#LLE edema: Negative for DVT by ___ on admission. He is on 
trosemide but could be related to infection. Will continue home 
torsemide and have the patient follow up with PCP after 
___ of therapy. 

#Ataxia: Unclear how long he has been having symptoms of 
instability; given unclear history that he reports at time of 
admission and reason for admission, obtained head CT w/concerns 
for acute or subacute stroke on ___ MRI/MRA was obtained on 
___ with no acute findings noted. Case was discussed with 
neurology who felth that the MRI read was the correct as his 
neuro exam was not focal. He should follow up with neurology as 
an outpatient. 

#DM2 with complications. ISSH while in ___ but HgA1c 5.7.

#CKD stage III: Cr currently at baseline of 1.5-1.9. Continued 
home lisinopril and initially torsemide but restarted prior to 
discharge. 

#Anemia:
-Iron 32, TIBC 256, Ferritin 244, Transferrin 197; colonoscopy
per atrius chart was ___: tortuous colon, no masses; 
-recent iron studies on ___ at nephrology visit were iron:
112, TIBC: 398, and transferrin 284; 
-f/u with PCP and nephrology for repeat iron studies/CBC;

#HTN
Continued home amlodipine and lisinopril.

#BPH/prostate cancer
Continued home tamsulosin

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
-  Outpt Neuro follow up. 
- Complete course of antibiotics for UTI and cellulitis. 

Greater than 30 minutes was spent in care coordination and 
counseling on the day of discharge.
