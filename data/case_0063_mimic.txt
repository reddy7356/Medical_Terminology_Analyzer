HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEM

EDEMA: Pt had similar episodes in the past due to medication 
noncompliance for CHF 
treatment. While it is likely that current symptoms are related 
to diastolic dysfunction and volume overload, pt otherwise lacks 
other signs and symptoms of volume overload. Significant 
contribution could be from venous stasis. We resumed his past 
out patient diuretic and fluid restriction during initial 
hospital stay, but dicontinued diuretic soon as pt appeared 
euvolemic to dry. 

URINARY RE TENSION: could be due to BPH, however more concerning 
is bladder ca vs prostate ca given age and constitutional 
symptoms. Also concerning was his UA which was positive for WBC 
and RBC without bacterial growth. We placed Foley, and pt put 
out 1.2 L of retained urine. Renal ultrasound was normal and 
negative for hydronephrosis. Urine cytology was sent (results 
pending), and we started Tamsulosin and Finasteride base on 
urology consult recommendation. He will need outpatient Urology 
follow up for further evaluation in the setting of a history of 
bladder ca Grade II in ___

HYPONATREMIA: could be due to CHF or very poor nutritional 
intake or post obstructive renal failure. He was fluid 
restricted. UA was not consistent with SIDH. Sodium improved 
some what and remained stable

DEPRESSION: Social work was consulted and we initiated treatment 
with Paxil 20 mg.
