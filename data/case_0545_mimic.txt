Pertinent Results:
Conclusions  
Pre CPB

No spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the left atrial 
appendage. The left atrial appendage emptying velocity is 
depressed (<0.2m/s). 

The left ventricular cavity is severely dilated. Overall left 
ventricular systolic function is severely depressed (LVEF= 30 
%). [Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely more 
depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.] 

The right ventricular free wall is hypertrophied. The right 
ventricular cavity is dilated with normal free wall 
contractility. 

The diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels 
are normal. There are focal calcifications in the aortic arch. 
There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. 

There are three aortic valve leaflets. An aortic valve 
prosthesis is present (Native Pulmonary Valve). There is no 
aortic valve stenosis. Moderate (2+) aortic regurgitation is 
seen. 

The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate (2+) 
mitral regurgitation is seen. 

The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate [2+] 
tricuspid regurgitation is seen with an annulus of 48mm. 

A pulmonic valve prosthesis is present with mild-mod 
regurgitation. 

Dr. ___ was notified in person of the results in the OR 
during the procedure.

Post CPB

The patient separated from bypass on epineprhine, milrinone and 
phenylephrine infusions. With a cardiac ouput of 2.4 LPM. 

Tricuspid ring is well seated with trivial regurgitation. There 
is a well seated mitral valve ring in good position with no 
residual MR and a peak gradient of 9mmHg. There is a mechanical 
Aortic Valve prosthesis which is well seated with no 
perivalvular leak. Peak gradient of 22 and mean of 11. 

The LVEF is unchanged from prior at 30%. There is no sign of 
aortic injury or dissection.

Final Report 
INDICATION:  ___ year old man with redo AVR/MVrep  // r/o inf,

EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT) 
  
TECHNIQUE:   Chest radiograph, PA and lateral views 
  
COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___ 08:24 
  
FINDINGS:  
  
There is opacity at the right lung base, new since 8 hr prior, 
which may be from aspiration. There is mild atelectasis of left 
lung base, improved from 8 hr prior. There are small bilateral 
pleural effusions. Right internal jugular venous line terminates 
in right atrium.  3 prosthetic heart valves and sternotomy wires 
are again noted. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged. 
  
IMPRESSION:  
  
Right lung base opacity is new since 8 hr prior and may be from 
aspiration. 
There are small bilateral pleural effusions.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ was admitted to the ___ on ___ for surgical 
management of his heart disease. He was placed on heparin as he 
had been off Coumadin for 5 days. He was worked-up in the usual 
preoperative manner. On ___ he was taken to the operating 
room where he underwent a redo sternotomy, mechanical aortic 
valve replacement, mitral valve repair and Maze procedure. 
Please see operative note for details. Postoperatively he was 
taken to the intensive care unit for further monitoring. He was 
acidotic and vasoplegic out of the OR on Epinephrine, Levophed 
and Milrinone, with high volume requirements and higher vent 
support. Over the next 2 days, he was weaned off all vasoactive 
medications and inotropes and extubated on POD2 without 
incidence. Platelets had dropped and Hit AB came back as 
positive. Swan was changed to Heparin free, he was started on 
Argatroban and Hematology was consulted. Coumadin was held until 
platelets increased to greater than 150. SRA was resulted as 
negative and patient was changed from  Argatroban to Heparin and 
bridged with Heparin until INR>2.0. The patient remained 
neurologically intact and hemodynamically stable. Beta blocker 
was initiated and the patient was started on a Lasix drip for 
diuresis. The patient was transferred to the telemetry floor for 
further recovery. Chest tubes and pacing wires were discontinued 
without complication. Lasix was changed to bolus dosing. He 
continues to be fluid overloaded and will continue to need 
diureses at home. His potassium is hight nornmal and is being 
discharged on daily potassium  only, a potassium level will need 
to be cheched on ___. The patient was evaluated by the 
physical therapy service for assistance with strength and 
mobility.  By the time of discharge on POD 11 the patient was 
ambulating freely, his wounds were healing and pain was 
controlled with oral analgesics.  The patient was discharged to 
home in good condition with appropriate follow up instructions.
