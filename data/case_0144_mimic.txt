DISCHARGE LABS: N/A
 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ with PMH HTN, bipolar with psychotic features is transferred 
from psychiatric facility for AMS after being found minimally 
responsive now much improved. 

ACUTE ISSUES: 

1. Acute encephalopathy: Patient received an extensive work up 
to evaluate for infectious, toxic, and metabolic etiologies of 
her AMS which has been negative to date. Specifically, toxic 
ingestions, hypothyroidism, electrolyte abnormalities, 
neurosyphilis were ruled out, and a head CT was negative for 
acute intracranial abnormalities. We have held medications with 
concern for anticholinergic toxicity and and she has improved. 
She had one episode of hypotension that resoved with fluids and 
has otherwise remained hemodynamically stable and her acute 
encephalopathy has resolved. An EEG was negative for 
epileptiform discharges or focal abnormalities. Patient is 
medically cleared for an inpatient psychiatric hospitalization.  


2. History of HTN: There is documentation of HTN in her chart 
from the OSH, however she is only on beta blockers, and she has 
been normotensive throughout her hospitalization with one 
episode of hypotension. Beta blockers were discontinued. 

3. Bipolar Disorder: Patient was continued on lithium and 
risperidone. She denied symptoms of mania but did endorse 
delusions of being an employee at her prior psychiatric 
facility. These delusions improved as her AMS resolved. Her 
trazodone was held in the setting of acute delerium. Her beta 
blockers were held in the setting of one episode of hypotension. 
Psychiatry was consulted. Patient received additional PRN doses 
of risperidone for agitation and subsequently developed 
worsening Parkinsonism. Her PRN doses were discontinued and 
standing dose reduced, and she received one dose of Cogentin. 
Her Parkinsonism continued and Risperidone was discontinued 
entirely. She was started on standing Cogentin 1 mg BID. 
Psychiatry recommended Zyprexa 2.5 mg BID PRN Agitation or 
audio/visual hallucinations but patient did not have subsequent 
agitation or AVH and thus Zyprexa was not started. Patient is 
medically cleared for inpatient psychiatric facility. She is 
admitted under ___, has a 1:1 sitter, and may not sign 
out AMA.  

4. White Oral Lesions: Upon admission, patient was very 
dehydrated and white oral lesions were noted. Initially 
concerning for oral candidiasis vs. skin sloughing in the 
setting of severe dehydration. The lesions improved with 
hydration and did not require further intervention. 

5. Dehydration: Patient presented with dry mucous membranes. She 
received IVF with improvement in clinical hydration status. 

6. Mildly elevated coags: Patient's coags were mildly elevated 
upon admission. She had no signs of bleeding and remained 
hemodynamically stable. Please continue to monitor as 
outpatient. 

7. Tachycardia: Patient was intermittently tachycardic in the 
setting of anxiety. Tachycardia resolved with PRN doses of 
Ativan, but we elected not to order a standing benzo in order to 
minimize delerium-inducing medications. Benzodiazepines were 
subsequently discontinued entirely. 

CHRONIC ISSUES: None

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: 
- Continue to monitor Parkinsonism features and titrate atypical 
antipsychotic to minimize this side effect
- Minimize delerium-inducing agents including benzos and 
anticholinergics
- Monitor tachycardia, most likely anxiety related
- Patient has a record of UCx from ___ on ___ documenting 
growth of ___ CFU MRSA. ___ was unable to provide 
documentation of whether this infection was treated. We repeated 
a UA and UCx on ___, both of which were negative. Our 
medical team, and in consultation with ID, determined there was 
no evidence of active UTI infection nor indication for 
antibiotic treatment at this time.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___, 

It was a pleasure caring for you during your admission to ___ 
___. You were admitted for altered mental status. Although we 
are not entirely sure what caused your altered mental status, we 
believe your anticholinergic and sedating medications likely 
contributed. We stopped these medications and your mental status 
improved. 

During your hospitalization, you also developed worsening 
symptoms of Parkinsonism, a side effect of your atypical 
antipsychotic. We discontinued your Risperidone and started you 
on Cogentin. Your psychiatrist at your ___ facility will 
continue to adjust your antipsychotic dosing to minimize this 
side effect while maximizing the benefit. 

Once again, it was a pleasure caring for you and we wish you the 
best in your recovery, 

Sincerely, 

___, MD
