Discharge Instructions:
You may shower and bathe normally.  Do not drive or drink 
alcohol if taking narcotic pain medication.  Resume all of your 
home medications, but please avoid aspirin/advil for three 
weeks.   Call Dr. ___ for appointment (___) 
AND if you have any urological questions.  If you have fevers > 
101.5 F, vomiting, severe abdominal pain, or inability to 
urinate, call your doctor or go to the nearest emergency room.

 

The operation you have experienced is a "scraping" operation. 
Bleeding was controlled with electrocautery which has produced a 
"scab" in the channel through which the urine passes (the 
urethra). About ___ weeks after the operation, pieces of the 
scab will fall off and come out with the urine. As this occurs, 
bleeding may be noted which is normal. You should not worry 
about this. Simply lie down and increase your fluid intake for a 
few hours. In most cases, the urine will clear. If bleeding 
occurs or persists for more than 12 hours or if clots appear 
impairing your stream, call your surgeon. Because of the 
potential for bleeding, aspirin (or Advil) should be avoided for 
the first 3 weeks after surgery.

You will be given a prescription for antibiotics to be taken for 
a few days after surgery. This is to help prevent infection. If 
you develop a fever over 101°, chills, or pain in the testicles, 
call your surgeon. Although not common, this may indicate 
infection that has developed beyond the control of the 
antibiotics that you have taken.

*** Call Dr. ___ office to schedule followup appointment 
for removal of catheter in 1 week.
