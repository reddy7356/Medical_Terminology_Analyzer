___ 5:00 am URINE
   URINE CULTURE (Final ___:    NO GROWTH. 

IMAGING:
==============
___ TTE
CONCLUSION:
- The left atrial volume index is mildly increased. The right 
atrium is moderately enlarged. There is normal left ventricular 
wall thickness with a normal cavity size. There is normal 
regional and global left ventricular systolic function. The 
visually estimated left ventricular ejection fraction is 55-60%. 
There is no resting left ventricular outflow tract gradient. 
Tissue Doppler suggests an increased left ventricular filling 
pressure (PCWP greater than 18 mmHg). Mildly dilated right 
ventricular cavity with normal free wall motion. The aortic 
sinus diameter is normal for gender with normal ascending aorta 
diameter for gender. The aortic arch diameter is normal with a 
normal descending aorta diameter. The aortic valve leaflets (3) 
appear structurally normal. No masses or vegetations are seen on 
the aortic valve. There is no aortic valve stenosis. There is no 
aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets appear 
structurally normal with no mitral valve prolapse. No masses or 
vegetations are seen on the mitral valve. There is mild [1+] 
mitral regurgitation. The pulmonic valve leaflets are normal. No 
masses/vegetations are seen on the pulmonic valve. The tricuspid 
valve leaflets appear structurally normal. No mass/ vegetation 
are seen on the tricuspid valve. There is mild to moderate 
[___] tricuspid regurgitation. There is mild pulmonary artery 
systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: 
- No 2D echocardiographic evidence for endocarditis. Mildly 
dilated right ventricle. Normal global and regional 
biventricular systolic function. Mild mitral regurgitation. Mild 
to moderate tricuspid regurgitation. Elevated LVEDP and mild 
pulmonary hypertension.

___ CXR Portable
FINDINGS: 
- Mildly enlarged cardiomediastinal silhouette.  Mild 
calcification and tortuosity of the descending thoracic aorta.  
Slight rightward deviation of the trachea.  Opacification 
overlying the cardiac silhouette likely represents a large 
hiatal hernia.  The pulmonary vasculature is normal.  Extensive 
bilateral interstitial opacities likely represent diffuse 
interstitial lung disease.  Mild bibasilar atelectasis.  No 
focal consolidation.  A rounded opacification at the right lung 
apex likely represents an emphysematous bulla or a pneumatocele. 
 No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.
IMPRESSION:
1.  Opacification overlying the cardiac silhouette likely 
represents a large hiatal hernia, however lateral view 
radiograph is recommended for confirmation.
2.  Extensive bilateral interstitial opacities likely represent 
diffuse interstitial lung disease.
3. A rounded opacification at the right lung apex likely 
represents an emphysematous bulla or a pneumatocele.

___ CXR Portable
IMPRESSION: 
- There has been interval placement of a right upper extremity 
PICC which terminates ___ the upper superior vena cava..
- The lungs are hyperinflated.  There is no focal consolidation, 
pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  There is a large hiatal 
hernia.  The cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged.  There is no 
overt pulmonary edema.  No acute osseous abnormalities are 
identified.

___ XR Hand
FINDINGS: 
- There is severe erosion and osteolysis involving approximately 
1.5 cm of the distal ulna.  Extensive erosive change and 
remodeling of the proximal carpus with near complete destruction 
of the proximal carpal row and severe narrowing at the 
radiocarpal joint with extensive remodeling of the distal 
radius. There is likely ankylosis at the radiocarpal joint.
- Erosive change at the head of the proximal phalanx of the 
thumb and the head of the middle phalanx of the index finger is 
moderate.  There is volar and ulnar subluxation of the base of 
the proximal phalanx of the thumb relative to the head of the 
first metacarpal.
- Soft tissue mineralization projecting ___ the region of MCP 
joints could represent cement from prior reported MCP 
arthroplasties, less likely soft tissue mineralization. Severe 
erosions possibly ___ the setting of postsurgical change with 
complete loss of the heads and necks of the second-fourth 
metacarpals with severe volar and ulnar subluxation of the base 
of the proximal phalanges of the second-fourth digits.
- Severe erosive change at the PIP joints of the fourth and 
fifth digits.
IMPRESSION: 
1.  Per OMR, the patient has had prior MCP joint arthroplasties 
with apparent removal.  There is severe erosion and likely a 
component of post surgical change at the second-fourth 
metacarpals where there is extensive erosion and loss of bone at 
the head neck of the second-fifth metacarpals.  There is severe 
ulnar and volar subluxation of the base of the proximal 
phalanges relative to metacarpals.  No prior comparison study to 
assess for progression.
2.  Severe remodeling of the proximal carpal row with severe 
joint space narrowing at the radiocarpal joint with radiocarpal 
ankylosis and remodeling of the distal radius.
3.  Extensive erosion of the distal 1.5 cm of ulna.
4.  Additional erosions at the head of the proximal phalanx of 
the thumb, head of the middle phalanx of the second digit and 
the fourth and fifth PIP joints are severe.

 
Brief Hospital Course:
BRIEF HOSPITAL COURSE
=====================
Mrs. ___ is a ___ woman with past medical history of 
rheumatoid arthritis (on MTX/toclizumab/prednisone), bilateral 
hand joint replacements as well as bilateral total knee 
replacements, GERD, and osteoporosis, who presented to ___ ED 
from ___ on ___ with progression of left hand cellulitis 
despite outpatient keflex and new R knee swelling/pain. 

She was found to have GPC bacteremia and R knee septic 
arthritis, likely secondary to the hematogenous spread of her L 
hand cellulitis. Patient underwent both a R knee washout and 
liner replacement and left hand debridement and has transitioned 
to a 6 week course of IV vancomycin with additional PO rifampin.

On multiple occasions, the patient was noted to have an 
irregular heart rhythm both while ambulating and at rest. ECG 
revealed PACs and SVT, and she was placed on low-dose 
metropolol. 

ACUTE ISSUES:
============= 
# Prosthetic joint infection, left hand cellulitis, MRSA 
bacteremia 
Found to have MRSA bacteremia ___ BCx at ___, L hand 
cellulitis, and R knee PJI. She was started on IV vancomycin/CTX 
initially at ___, and was then transitioned to IV 
vancomycin/meropenem at ___. Wound cultures from left hand 
infection and blood cultures grew MRSA; meropenem was thus 
discontinued. She underwent L hand debridement on ___ and R knee 
debridement/liner replacement ___ and has transitioned to a 6 
week course of IV vancomycin with additional PO rifampin. Her 
most recent blood cultures (___) were negative, and her TTE did 
not show any signs of endocarditis. TEE was deferred as she 
given plan for 6 week course. Her home immunosuppressive RA 
regimen has been discontinued iso infection, although she is 
safe to restart her home celecoxib for pain management and was 
continued on prednisone 10mg qd. R knee drain removed right 
before discharge. PICC ___ place for IV antibiotics.

#Rheumatoid arthritis 
Per Dr. ___ rheumatologist), patient is safe to 
restart MTX and leucovorin ___ a few weeks. He also recommends 
holding off on toclizumab until finishing her outpatient 
antibiotic regimen and continuing celecoxib and prednisone 10 mg 
for pain management. Although Mrs. ___ was experiencing some 
joint pain, her most recent CRP was 3.3, which reassured us that 
her pain was likely due to overuse injury rather than an RA 
flare. ___ the case of an RA flare, only her prednisone dose 
should be increased. She has rheumatology follow up scheduled 
for ___. 

#Palpitations
Mrs. ___ complained of several episodes of palpitations and was 
noted to have SVT on telemetry. She has history of tachycardia 
that breaks with Valsalva maneuver. ECG and telemetry were 
indicative of PACs and SVT, possibly ___ the setting of 
deconditioning and sensitivity to exertion. She was started on 
metropolol 12.5 mg daily but should follow up with her 
outpatient cardiologist for further evaluation. Can consider 
uptitrating metoprolol for palpitations and SVT as an 
outpatient.

CHRONIC ISSUES
==============
#Bibasilar atelectasis concerning for interstitial lung disease
Mrs. ___ was noted to have bibasilar crackles on exam, though 
she was reassuringly not symptomatic nor hypoxemic. CXR on ___ 
showed bilateral interstitial opacities concerning for ILD 
secondary to her RA. 

#Foot cyst
Mrs. ___ was noted to have benign-appearing cyst ___ ___. ___ orthopedics was concerned for infection, but held off 
intervention given her more acute hand and knee infections. Per 
___ podiatry, the lesion is a ganglion cyst with no required 
intervention.
