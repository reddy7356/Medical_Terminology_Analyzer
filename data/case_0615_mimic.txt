Chief Complaint:
Chest pain
 
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Percutaneous Coronary Intervention with drug eluting stent 
placement.
 
History of Present Illness:
___ year old female with PMH significant for CAD and aortic 
stenosis s/p hybrid procedure including mid LAD stenting and 
subsequent open heart surgery with AVR with bioprosthesis in 
___.  In ___ the patient was treated at ___ 
___ for an episode of recurrent clinical angina for which 
she ruled out for an MI.  She describes this as chest and
throat "pressure."  She underwent diagnostic cardiac 
catheterization ___ at ___ which revealed an eccentric 
smooth bordered 80% mid LAD stenosis immediately prior to the 
origin of a very large major diagonal branch and a focal 
eccentric 95% mid LAD stenosis just after the origin of the same 
diagonal vessel.  The patient is now referred for planned 
LAD-Diagonal branch PCI of these lesions.
During the procedure, a DES was placed into a large diagonal off 
of the mid LAD. A severely retroflexed smaller LAD was found to 
be jailed, slow flow, and they were unable to rescue.

hemodynamically stable, feeling fine. Denies chest pain and SOB.

1. Coronary angiography in this right dominant system 
demonstrated 80% 
mid LAD stenosis into a diagonal branch. The continuation of the 
LAD was 
retroflexed and had a 90% stenosis at its origin, and was a 
small 
caliber vessel that was likley intramyocardial. The diagonal 
branch was 
the larger parent vessel. The ___ had no angiographically 
apparent 
disease. The LCx was widely patent. The RCA was not injected. 
2. Limited resting hemodynamics reveal systemic arterial 
normotension 
with SBP 126 mmHg. 
3. Successful PCI of the LAD into a large diagonal branch with 
3.5x12mm 
Promus DES (see ___ comments). 
4. Unable to cross into the LAD with TIMI 2 flow at the end of 
the 
procedure (see ___ comments). 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ y/o female with PMH of CAD and aortic stenosis s/p mid LAD 
stenting and AVR with bioprosthesis in ___.  Underwent 
diagnostic cath on ___ which revealed 80% mid LAD stenosis 
and a focal eccentric 95% mid LAD stenosis.  Patient was 
referred for planned LAD-Diagonal branch PCI. 
.  
#CAD s/p ___ into mid LAD large diagonal:  During the 
procedure, the diagonal DES resulted in a jailed LAD which was 
unable to be rescued but showed TIMI 2 flow.  The LAD was small 
and thought to not be a dominant vessel.  She was admitted to 
the CCU for further monitoring.  Her cardiac enzymes did not 
increase and she remained chest pain free throughout the short 
hospitalization.  She was maintained on integrillin for 18hrs 
post-catheterization, and discharged on her home medications for 
CAD.
.
#HTN: her blood pressure medications were restarted and no 
changes were made as her BP was well controlled.

Discharge Instructions:
It was a pleasure to take care of you at ___ 
___. 

During your hospital stay you had a procedure done to reverse 
two heart vessel narrowings. One of the narrowings was 
successfully reversed with a stent and for that you will need to 
take a medication for ___ year to prevent the wire from 
reocluding. The other narrowing you had could not be repaired. 
You were transfered to the CCU to be better watched following 
the procedure. You had no complications during your CCU stay.

We are making the following changes in your home medications:
-Aspirin from 81mg to 325mg for 1 month, daily by mouth. After 1 
month you can likely resume taking aspirin 81mg as before.  
Please speak with your cardiologist about this medication change 
first.
-Start Plavix 75mg daily by mouth. You should take this 
medication for at least ___ year to prevent reoclusion of the wire 
that was placed in one of your heart vessels.

You should continue to take all the other medications as usual.
 
Followup Instructions:
