Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the ___ Surgical Service on 
___ for evaluation and treatment of abdominal pain. She was 
seen in clinic prior to admission status post ERCP, and after 
repeat US and HIDA she had no subsequent cystic duct
obstruction. The patient underwent laparoscopic cholecystectomy, 
which went well without complication (refer to the Operative 
Note for details). After a brief, uneventful stay in the PACU, 
the patient arrived on the floor tolerating IV fluids, and on IV 
and PO for pain control.  The patient was hemodynamically 
stable. There was concern for EKG changes seen intraoperatively, 
but repeat cardiac enzymes were all negative. 

Pain was well controlled. Diet was progressively advanced as 
tolerated to a regular diet with good tolerability. The patient 
voided without problem. During this hospitalization, the patient 
ambulated early and frequently, was adherent with respiratory 
toilet and incentive spirometry, and actively participated in 
the plan of care. The patient received subcutaneous heparin and 
venodyne boots were used during this stay.

At the time of discharge, the patient was doing well, afebrile 
with stable vital signs. The patient was tolerating a regular 
diet, ambulating, voiding without assistance, and pain was well 
controlled.  The patient was discharged home without services. 
The patient received discharge teaching and follow-up 
instructions with understanding verbalized and agreement with 
the discharge plan.

 o You will need to stay out of bathtubs or swimming pools for a 
time while your incision is healing. Ask your doctor when you 
can resume tub baths or swimming. 
   
 HOW YOU MAY FEEL:  
 o  You may feel weak or "washed out" for a couple of weeks. You 
might want to nap often. Simple tasks may exhaust you. 
 o  You may have a sore throat because of a tube that was in 
your throat during surgery. 
 o  You might have trouble concentrating or difficulty sleeping. 
You might feel somewhat depressed. 
 o  You could have a poor appetite for a while. Food may seem 
unappealing. 
 o  All of these feelings and reactions are normal and should go 
away in a short time.  If they do not, tell your surgeon. 
   
 YOUR INCISION: 
 o Tomorrow you may shower and remove the gauzes over your 
incisions. Under these dressing you have small plastic bandages 
called steri-strips. Do not remove steri-strips for 2 weeks.

incision.) But if they fall off before that that's okay).

medications. If needed, you may take a stool softener (such as 
Colace, one capsule) or gentle laxative (such as milk of 
magnesia, 1 tbs) twice a day. You can get both of these 
medicines without a prescription. 
 o If you go 48 hours without a bowel movement, or have pain 
moving the bowels, call your surgeon.  
   
 PAIN MANAGEMENT: 
 o It is normal to feel some discomfort/pain following abdominal 
surgery. This pain is often described as "soreness".  
 o Your pain should get better day by day. If you find the pain 
is getting worse instead of better, please contact your surgeon. 

 o You will receive a prescription for pain medicine to take by 
mouth. It is important to take this medicine as directed. o Do 
not take it more frequently than prescribed. Do not take more 
medicine at one time than prescribed.

prescription pain medicine. Please don't take any other pain 
medicine, including non-prescription pain medicine, unless your 
surgeon has said its okay.
