Brief Hospital Course:
___ F PMHx HTN, CAD c/b MI s/p DES to LAD (___), 
hypothyroidism who initially presented to ___ after fall now 
with hypertensive emergency, chest pain.

#HTN emergency: patient with reported difficult to control BP, 
with hypertensive emergency likely ___ not receiving her home 
medications and severe pain. Concern for evidence of end-organ 
damage with elevated Cr (baseline per outpatient records appears 
to be 1.6-7). EKG showed dynamic changes, but trp negative x3. 
She required admission to CCU for titration of blood pressure 
medication. Patient also required intermittent nitro gtt for BP 
control. EKG changes resolved with blood pressure control. Blood 
pressure medications were titrated and final regimen is:
- clonidine 0.5 Q6 hours
- ramipril 10 mg daily
- metoprolol XL 50mg daily (pre-admission atenolol was 
discontinued)
- chlorthalidone 25 mg PO daily (new medication)
- Imdur 60 mg daily (new medication)

# Chest pain: 
# Coronary artery disease s/p LAD stent (___):
Patient w/CAD s/p LAD stent (___). ECG showed dynamic changes 
in the setting of hypertensive emergency, specifically with STE 
in avR, V1 and diffuse ST depressions. Trops negative x1. Recent 
cath (___) without severe disease. Serial EKGs showed 
improvement in ST changes once BP normalized. Troponins were 
negative x 3. Heparin gtt was not started ___ recent trauma. 
NCHCT negative for hemorrhage or infarct. Patient was given 325 
mg ASA at onset of htn emergency and then 81 mg ASA daily. Given 
patient's report of severe allergy to statin, this was not 
given. Patient switched from atenolol to metoprolol as noted 
above.

# ?UTI: 
# ESBL:
Patient initially received CTX for UA concerning for UA. 
However, patient had been asymptomatic and UCx <10^5 cfus ESBL. 
CTX discontinued and foley catheter removed. Patient maintained 
on contact precautions per hospital policy for ESBL.

# Multiple injuries s/p fall: patient with reported mechanical 
fall, s/p trauma evaluation negative for acute fracture. Pain 
control with po Tylenol/oxycodone/IV dilaudid PRN initially and 
weaned to Tylenol PRN. Patient will need hand specialty 
follow-up for ongoing right hand ttp to ensure no carpal 
fracture. ___ evaluated and recommended the patient could be 
discharge home w/ home ___. 

# Non gap and elevated anion gap metabolic acidosis: AG 16, HCO3 
11. Outpatient labs indicate prior normal bicarb levels. Renal 
consulted during hospitalization. Unclear etiology; suspect 
arginine as contributor as well as Tylenol.  No clear evidence 
of GI bicarbonate losses.  Lactate wnl and urine w/o evidence of 
ketones. Discontinued arginine iso of acidosis and recommend 
follow-up as outpatient. 

---------------
CHRONIC ISSUES: 
---------------

# Colitis: Patient continued on home mesalamine PR. She had 
intermittent constipation initially, but then standing bowel 
regimen of Bisacodyl ___AILY, Miralax daily, Senna and 
Colace improved constipation. 

# Hypothyroidism: Continued on home regimen of tirosant: 
Tirosint *NF* (levothyroxine) 25 mcg oral 3X/WEEK (___) 
Tirosint *NF* (levothyroxine) 50 mcg oral 4X/WEEK (___) 

# Sinus bradycardia: Chronic issue for the patient. She remained 
HDS, asx. HR appropriately increases with exercise.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES  
===========================  
[] Please check bicarb to ensure resolution off arginine 
[] Please consider outpatient work up for causes of secondary 
hypertension 
[] Please note patient had right thumb/scaphoid tenderness post 
fall for which initial XRAY negative for acute fracture 
including follow up 1week post XRAY. Please refer for Hand 
Clinic follow up if clinically indicated. Pain resolved prior to 
discharge. 
[] Patient with history of migraine with aura, previously 
improved with atentolol. She was switched to metoprolol in 
hospital, please continue to monitor for recurrence of 
migraines.
[] Consider pMIBI or continued cardiac w/u for dynamic changes 
with hypertensive episodes to assess area of fixed 
hypoperfusion.
[] Patient presented with DNR/DNI following discussion with PCP, 
she elected to reverse code status after extensive discussion in 
the hospital. Please continue ongoing discussion with patient 
outpatient.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,

You were admitted to the hospital because you had a fall down a 
flight of stairs. You had imaging and fortunately, you did not 
have any broken bones. However, you did have a lot of bruising 
of your hands, face, and ribs. 

While you were in the hospital you had very high blood 
pressures. You were transferred to the cardiac intensive care 
unit so your blood pressure could be monitored carefully and 
better controlled. 

Your blood pressure medications were changed to better control 
your blood pressures.  We recommend strongly that you stop 
taking arginine because we think it may be causing acid to build 
up in your blood. 

Your blood pressure medications are:
Ramipril 10 mg daily
Imdur 60 mg daily
Clonidine 0.5 every 6 hours
Chlorthalidone 25 mg daily
Metoprolol 50 mg daily

Now that you are going home you should take all of your 
medications as prescribed.

Please call your primary care provider ___ to schedule an 
appointment either that day or for follow up early in the next 
week.
Please follow up either with a nephrologist (kidney doctor) at 
___ or with the nephrologists here at ___.  

Here are some contact numbers:
___ Nephrology ___
___ Nephrology ___

Take your blood pressure daily while you are relaxed while 
seated with your arm at the level of your heart. Record your 
blood pressures.  

Please seek medical attention if your BP is >200/100, your BP is 
<90/60, you develop chest pain, trouble breathing, or have 
changes in your vision.

We wish you the best!
