History of Present Illness:
Ms. ___ is a ___ year old female with DMT2 (not on any
medications, poorly controlled with diet and exercise), GERD, 
who
was transferred from ___ where she presented with changes
in her speech, frontal headache, as well as transient tingling 
of
her R thumb, index finger, and middle finger. She was in her
usual state of health until 1 week ago (___) when she noted that
her tongue felt different, as it was swollen. She also thought
that her mouth felt dry. She called her PCP's office and was
advised to start taking OTC Benadryl for presumed allergic
reaction. She took 1 pill of unknown dose of OTC Benadryl in the
morning and in the evening of FRI, SAT, and SUN. the Benadryl
made her drowsy and she slept through most of the weekend.  She
went to work on MON (works as a ___) and she told 
a
nurse at work about her symptoms.  At that time the nurse noted
that her speech was different, she was speaking more slowly than
usual and had difficulty getting words out - patient describes
this as if she knew what she wanted to say but it took her 
longer
than usual to say it.  She went to ___ ER where she was
assessed and endorsed starting birth control pills 1 week prior
to onset of symptoms (unclear which birth control), was advised
to stop it and take scheduled Benadryl every 6 hours.  She was
discharged home and felt well.  She went to the ___ class the
same day and is able to tolerate the exercise without any
symptoms.  On TUE and WED she was taking the scheduled Benadryl
as advised, felt tired but was able to push through the day.  
She
states that her symptoms of the tongue sensation have improved 
on
Benadryl but did not resolve completely which is why she
presented to urgent care at her PCPs office where she was
evaluated and the concern was raised about postnasal drip and
possibly nasal voice, she was referred to ENT for further
evaluation and was scheduled to see them on ___. On ___ morning
(yesterday) upon awakening she noted tingling sensation on the
dorsal surface of her right thumb, index finger, middle finger,
up to the wrist.  She drove to work and shared hair symptoms 
with
the NP whom she works for who also noted that her voice sounded
different than baseline.  At that time she also noticed that she
was experiencing a centrally located frontal headache that was
dull, constant, radiating to the back, 4 out of 10,
non-positional. EMS was called and she was taken to ___. 
By the time of the arrival of the EMS, the tingling sensation in
the right hand resolved (total duration of 3 hours), but she
noted numbness over the same distribution in the right hand as
the tingling. 

At ___, she was evaluated with NCHCT which was negative
for hemorrhage but showed bilateral frontal cortical
hypodensities concerning for infarction and small subcortical
hypodensity in bilateral frontal and parietal lobes. MRI brain
showed multiple bilateral frontal peripherally located foci of
restricted diffusion concerning for infarcts.  MRA of head and
neck showed occlusive disease in both supraclinoid ICA and MCA
concerning for moyamoya disease.  US duplex of bilateral 
carotids
was negative for evidence of carotid stenosis.  She was
transferred here for further evaluation and management. EKG w/
NSR, left axis deviation noted, T-wave inversions in lead III,
QTC 382, no other acute significant ST-T wave changes noted
compared to prior EKG from ___.  Labs notable for
hemoglobin 9.3 with MCV 72, LDL 121, Hgb A1c 8.6, ESR 59, CRP
18.2, Mg 1.6 (repleted).  Blood cultures were drawn on 
admission.
___, anticardiolipin antibodies, beta-2 macroglobulin ordered 
and
pending at the time of transfer.  She was started on aspirin 81
mg daily, atorvastatin 40 mg daily.  She was scheduled to get 
TTE
with bubble study; however, was transferred prior to completion.

Of note, patient has never had similar symptoms. Patient's 
mother
who lives with her (and is present at bedside) has not noted any
speech changes.  Furthermore, patient states that she has a long
history of speech difficulties and in the past has been slurring
words and has had difficulties pronouncing some words as a 
child,
but has never received any speech therapy.  Patient has never
been a smoker, and denies IV drug use.

On neuro ROS, the pt denies loss of vision, blurred
vision, diplopia, dysphagia, lightheadedness, vertigo, tinnitus
or hearing difficulty. Denies difficulties comprehending speech. 

Denies focal weakness, numbness. No bowel or bladder 
incontinence
or retention. Denies difficulty with gait.

RELEVANT IMAGES:

OSH labs reviewed.

RELEVANT IMAGES AND STUDIES (FROM OSH - transcribed exactly as
appearing in reports):

___ ___:
Impression:
1.  Bilateral frontal cortical hypodensities concerning for
infarction, potentially embolic in distribution.  No hemorrhage.
2.  Smaller subcortical hypodensities in the bilateral frontal
and parietal lobes.
3.  8mm soft tissue nodule in the left parotid superficial lobe,
most likely representing lymph node in a patient of this age. 
However continued clinical follow-up is recommended to document
stability.  If there is interval change, recommend further
evaluation with ultrasound.
4.  Additional findings as described above.

MRI W/WO CONTRAST ___:
Impression:
1.  Multiple bilateral frontal predominantly peripherally 
located
foci of restricted diffusion, some which are cortical is
identified.  These lesions do not demonstrate postcontrast
enhancement although there is some gyriform enhancement along 
the
frontal sulci associated with hypodensity on same day head CT. 
Due to the overall lack of enhancement, this is felt to be most
compatible with late acute infarcts in embolic distribution
rather than demyelinating process.
2.  Subtle sulcal enhancement associated with the regions of
diffusion-weighted hyperintense and FLAIR hyperintense signal
with cortical thickening corresponds to regions of hypodensity 
on
same-day head CT, felt likely to represent luxury perfusion. 
However, clinical correlation for infectious process is
recommended.
3.  The marrow signal is diffusely T1 hypointense, which made be
seen in the setting of marrow reconversion with chronic anemia. 
Correlation with CBC values is recommended.
4.  Additional findings described above.

MRA ___:
Impression:
1.  Occlusive disease identified in both supraclinoid internal
carotid arteries and middle cerebral arteries which is 
consistent
with ___ disease.  The underlying condition can be
determined by clinical correlation.
2.  Decreased proximal flow in the right petrous internal 
carotid
is likely due to distal occlusive disease.

US CAROTID DUPLEX BILAT ___:
Impression: Unremarkable study.  No evidence carotid stenosis.
 
Brief Hospital Course:
Patient is a ___ year old woman with history of diabetes type 2, 
poorly diet-controlled, obesity s/p gastric bypass, who 
initially presented to ___ with a week of intermittent 
symptoms included slurred speech and right hand numbness, after 
recently been started on estrogen containing OCP. There, she was 
found to have scattered foci of acute ischemic infarcts in the 
bilateral frontal and temporal lobes. MRA head was performed and 
showed severe stenosis of the intracranial internal carotid 
arteries and middle cerebral arteries, worse on the right. She 
was subsequently transferred to ___ for further care on the 
Stroke service.

On evaluation here, her overall picture was concerning for 
___ disease. Differential considerations also include 
vasopasm, severe atherosclerosis, vasculitis, etc., although 
these were all deemed far less likely. Further lab workup 
included serum/urine tox screens (negative), CBC with slight 
anemia, ESR/CR (slightly elevated of unclear significance, HIV 
(negative), ___ Ab/Sjo___'s Ab (pending), 
lupus AC/beta2-glycoprotein Ab/anti-cardiolipin Ab (pending), 
ACE (pending), ANCA (pending), and Hgb electrophoresis 
(pending). LDL was 121 and A1c 8.6 at OSH. Vascular Neurosurgery 
was consulted for consideration of diagnostic cerebral 
angiography and further therapeutic options. Given their limited 
availability over the weekend, they will arrange for outpatient 
procedure.

For therapy, she was started on aspirin 81mg daily, atorvastatin 
for hyperlipidemia, and discharged on metformin given poor diet 
control. She should follow up with her PCP to address 
hyperglycemia and hyperlipidemia management.

Transitional issues:
[ ] Neurosurgery to arrange for cerebral angiogram.
[ ] Patient will be scheduled for outpatient Stroke followup.
[ ] Please follow up pending labs: ___, dsDNA, ___ Ab, 
Sjogren's Ab, lupus AC, beta2-glycoprotein Ab, anti-cardiolipin 
Ab, ACE, ANCA, and Hgb electrophoresis.
[ ] Patient should continue aspirin 81mg daily in the meantime 
and was counseled to avoid dehydration.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear ___,

You were transferred from ___ to ___ for further 
evaluation of symptoms of changes in your speech, frontal 
headache, and transient tingling of your R thumb, index finger, 
and middle finger. You were evaluated with a CT and MRI of the 
head which were both notable for very small multi-focal strokes 
that were scattered throughout bilateral frontal and parietal 
lobes. The vessels of the head and neck were evaluated and were 
consistent with a disease called moyamoya. Neurosurgery was 
consulted and recommendation was made to further evaluate your 
vasculature with a cerebral angiogram, which will be schedule in 
the near future in an oupatient setting. Additional diagnoses 
were considered as well and several labs were sent to further 
work them up. Your initial exam was notable only for mild right 
facial weakness and very mild weakness of the right arm. 

Stroke can have many different causes, so we assessed you for 
medical conditions that might raise your risk of having stroke. 
In order to prevent future strokes, we plan to modify those risk 
factors. Your risk factors are:  
- Severe narrowing of the blood vessels in your brain
- Diabetes Mellitus Type 2
- High cholesterol

You may have a condition called Moyamoya syndrome. To evaluate 
for this, you will have a test called a Cerebral Angiogram. We 
will arrange for this as an outpatient in the next week. If you 
do not hear back within the next week, please call ___ to schedule.

We are changing your medications as follows:  
- Start taking Aspirin 81mg daily (for stroke prevention)
- Start taking Atorvastatin 40mg daily (for cholesterol)
- Start taking metformin 500mg twice daily (for diabetes)

Please take your other medications as prescribed.  

Please followup with Neurology and your primary care physician.  


If you experience any of the symptoms below, please seek 
emergency medical attention by calling Emergency Medical 
Services (dialing 911). In particular, since stroke can recur, 
please pay attention to the sudden onset and persistence of 
these symptoms:  
 - Sudden partial or complete loss of vision  
 - Sudden loss of the ability to speak words from your mouth  
 - Sudden loss of the ability to understand others speaking to 
you  
 - Sudden weakness of one side of the body  
 - Sudden drooping of one side of the face  
 - Sudden loss of sensation of one side of the body  
 
It was a pleasure to take care of you while during this 
hospitalization.

Sincerely,  
Your ___ Neurology Team

Discharge Instructions:
Elective Encephalo-duro-aterio-synangiosis (EDAS) for ___ 
Disease

Call your neurosurgeon’s office and speak to the Nurse 
Practitioner if you have:
 
* Any changes in your vision, speech or ability to move your 
arms & legs

* Any swelling, drainage or redness of your incision

* Any problems from your medications like, nausea, vomiting or 
extreme tiredness

* Any temperature higher than 101.5 F degrees

* Headaches that do not go away after taking your prescribed 
medication

Activity: 

* Start to return to your normal daily activities as you are 
able.  Start slowly and increase your activity at your own pace.
* Take special care to remain hydrated before, during, and after 
all activities 

* Do not drive a car or any other motorized vehicle for at least 
10 days after your surgery.  Your nurse practitioner ___ give 
you more information about when you can begin driving again when 
you have your sutures removed.   

Incision Care: 

* Keep your wound clean and dry.
* Do not rub, scratch, scrub or pick at any scabs that are on 
the incision.  
* You need to have your sutures removed ___ days after your 
surgery.  
* Do not use shampoo until after the sutures are removed.
* When you are allowed to shampoo your hair:
   * Let the shampoo run off the incision
   * Gently pat the incision with a towel to dry the area

Physical Issues you may Experience after Surgery:

* You may have constipation or difficulty moving your bowels.  
You can prevent constipation by:
   oDrinking lots of liquids like water and juice
   oIncreasing the amount of fiber you eat.  Fiber is contained 
in vegetables, prunes, fiber-rich breads, cereals and fiber 
supplements
   oExercising
   oUsing over-the-counter laxatives or bowel stimulants such 
as Docusate or Senokot. Stop using these medications if you have 
loose bowel movements or diarrhea

* Fatigue or extreme tiredness that will get better over time

* Numbness or tingling in the area where the incision is 
located.  This feeling may take weeks to months to go away 
completely.

* Muffled hearing in the ear closest to the incision.  

* Low back pain or shooting pain down the legs.  It can get 
better if you are more active. Make sure your clinician is aware 
of these symptoms.

Importance of Hydration after Surgery

* It is imperative that you remain hydrated after surgery
   oRemaining hydrated ensures proper blood volume, allowing 
blood to pass through the bypass without complication

* We recommend drinking approximately 2 liters (about two large 
soda bottles) of fluids a day after the procedure
   oAvoid excessive use of caffeine or alcohol as both can lead 
to the loss of fluids

Lifestyle expectations and changes after surgery:

* You may feel depressed.  Symptoms of depression can include: 
   oFeeling “down” or sad
   oBeing irritable, frustrated or confused
   oFeeling distracted
   oHaving lower self-esteem or relationship challenges
   oBeing unable to sleep or having insomnia
   oFeeling lonely

* If you have any of these symptoms, you can contact your 
Primary Care Provider who can refer you to a Psychologist or 
Psychiatrist. 

* You will be placed on lifelong aspirin after surgery to ensure 
proper blood flow through the bypass
   oIf you have any known side effects while taking aspirin, it 
is important to let your neurosurgeon know

* If you previously took birth control pills you may be asked to 
explore alternative forms of birth control
   oBirth control pills carry a risk of causing blood clots and 
therefore may inhibit blood flow through the bypass

* You should avoid high speed roller coasters, tight fitting 
items around your head and skydiving
   oAll of these activities can alter blood flow in your head, 
potentially disrupting the bypass
