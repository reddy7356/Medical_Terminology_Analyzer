Brief Hospital Course:
The patient is an ___ year old woman with pulmonary mycobacterium 
avium infection with bronchiectasis and Rheumatoid arthritis on 
Areva and Plaquenil who presented with fever and mild cough. 
Chest x-ray on admission showed new small infiltrate oncerning 
for pneumonia with repeat chest x-ray the following day after IV 
fluid hydration showing increased left lower lobe opacification 
confirming a pneumonia. 
Given these findings, she was treated with levofloxacin with 
instructions to complete a 5 day course.
She clinically appeared quite well throughout her hospital stay, 
and maintained good oxygen saturation both at rest and with 
ambulation.  She denied any shortness of breath.
Of note, prior to discharge, she did have an episode of 
dizziness, nausea, at which time her blood pressure was noted to 
be low.  She was given IV fluids with quick resolution of her 
symptoms and this was attributed to a likely vagal reaction (she 
was in the restroom at time of onset of the symptoms).
She was discharged with follow up with her primary care 
physician, at which time she should have a repeat chest x-ray to 
ensure clearance of her pneumonia.
.
Of note, her family is also concerned regarding her lack of 
appetite and weight loss, which I instructed them to address 
with her primary care physician.
.
In regards to the pulmonary ___ and bronchiectasis: She is on  3 
drug regimen: azithromycin, ethambutol, and rifampin. This was 
continued during this hospitalization. 
.
Her other medical issues remained stable throughout her hospital 
course.

procedure well and are now ready to be discharged from the 
hospital.   Please follow the recommendations below to ensure a 
speedy and uneventful recovery.
Peripheral Angiography
Puncture Site Care
For one week:
•Do not take a tub bath, go swimming or use a Jacuzzi or hot 
tub.
•Use only mild soap and water to gently clean the area around 
the puncture site. 
•Gently pat the puncture site dry after showering. 
•Do not use powders, lotions, or ointments in the area of the 
puncture site. 

You may remove the bandage and shower the day after the 
procedure.  You may leave the bandage off. 
You may have a small bruise around the puncture site.  This is 
normal and will go away one-two weeks. 
Activity

For the first week:
•Do not lift, push , pull or carry anything heavier than 10 
pounds
•Do not do any exercises or activity that causes you to hold 
your breath or bear down with abdominal muscles.   Take care not 
to put strain on your abdominal muscles when coughing, sneezing, 
or moving your bowels.
After one week:
•You may go back to all your regular activities, including 
sexual activity.  We suggest you begin your exercise program at 
half of your usual routine for the first few days.   You may 
then gradually work back to your full routine.

admitted with cough and fever - improved with levofloxacin. She
has had recent falls and functional decline,  which is the
primary reason her daughter brought her in to the hospital.  She 
was evaluated by physical therapy who recommended short term 
rehabilitation.

#BRONCHITIS  
#BRONCHIECTASIS W/ ACUTE EXACERBATION
 The patient has increased upper airway secretions, cough and
fever, consistent with a diagnosis of bronchitis. Given her
history of bronchiectasis and prior sputum culture positive for
pseudomonas we treated her with levofloxacin(prior pseudomonas
culture from ___ pan-sensitive). Was briefly on Cefepime, but
this was discontinued given lower concern for pneumonia, overall
stability and ongoing improvement.  Urine legionella negative
 - Continue levofloxacin for ___iscussed with Dr.
___ outpatient pulmonologist.  Course to end 
___. 
 - Flutter valve, chest ___, saline nebs for mobilization of
secretions.

#CHRONIC PULMONARY ___ INFECTION  
 The patient has been on suppressive antibiotics for ___ years
and her respiratory status has remained stable, despite repeated
positive AFB.  Continues on ethambutol/rifampin/azithro.  

#HTN - BP at times in the 190-200s during hospitalization
- INCREASED lisinopril to 20mg daily, patient declined take
lisinopril 40mg, because she is afraid it is too much too
quickly, and she would prefer to titrate her medications more
slowly.  Understands risk of stroke, heart disease, and that she
may need further titration in the future

#RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS  
 - Continue prednisone 2.5 mg daily  
 - Held MTX and Xeljanz in the setting of acute infection, 
restart after completion of antibiotic course.  

#PERIPHERAL ARTERIAL DISEASE  
 - Continue ASA 81 mg daily, cilostazol 100 mg BID and Lipitor 
40
mg daily  

#HYPOTHYROIDISM

Evaluated by physical therapy who recommended discharge to short 
term rehabilitation, < 30 day stay anticipated.  Daughter is 
beginning to look into long-term care options for her mother

Discharge Diagnosis:
Rib fractures, L1/L2 transverse process fractures

 
Discharge Condition:
Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Level of Consciousness: Alert and interactive.
Activity Status: Ambulatory - Independent.

 
Discharge Instructions:
* Your injury caused right nondisplaced ___ rib fractures, 
bilateral minimally displaced 12th rib fractures, right L1 and 
L2 transverse process fractures, left L1 transverse process 
fracture which can cause severe pain and subsequently cause you 
to take shallow breaths because of the pain.
 
* You should take your pain medication as directed to stay ahead 
of the pain otherwise you won't be able to take deep breaths. If 
the pain medication is too sedating take half the dose and 
notify your physician.
 
* Pneumonia is a complication of rib fractures.  In order to 
decrease your risk you must use your incentive spirometer 4 
times every hour while awake.  This will help expand the small 
airways in your lungs and assist in coughing up secretions that 
pool in the lungs.
 
* You will be more comfortable if you use a cough pillow to hold 
against your chest and guard your rib cage while coughing and 
deep breathing.
 
* Symptomatic relief with ice packs or heating pads for short 
periods may ease the pain.
 
* Narcotic pain medication can cause constipation therefore you 
should take a stool softener twice daily and increase your fluid 
and fiber intake if possible.
 
* Do NOT smoke
 
* If your doctor allows, non-steroidal ___ drugs 
are very effective in controlling pain ( ie, Ibuprofen, Motrin, 
Advil, Aleve, Naprosyn) but they have their own set of side 
effects so make sure your doctor approves.
 
* Return to the Emergency Room right away for any acute 
shortness of breath, increased pain or crackling sensation 
around your ribs (crepitus).
