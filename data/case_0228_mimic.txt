Brief Hospital Course:
___ presenting with 1.5 weeks petichael rash and 
thrombocytopenia (platlets of 5).  
.  
# thrombocytopenia - Definite etiology unclear as yet, but 
likely post-viral (given atypical leukocytes also on smear), 
medication induced (NSAIDs), or ITP.  There was no evidence of 
bleeding noted, and head CT was negative.  Hemolysis labs were 
negative, and no schistocytes were noted on smear.  Iron studies 
and B12 were unremarkable.  HIV and hepatitis panel were 
negative.  Started prednisone empirically.  Platelet count was 
initally 5, and gradually increased to 15 on the day of 
discharge.  LFTs were also mildly elevated initially, but 
trended downward.  Antiplatelet antibody was sent, and was still 
pending at the time of discharge.  Hematology followed the 
patient during her hospital course.  She was discharged on 
prednisone 60mg to be continued until followup with hematology, 
with plan for a slow taper.  She will have her platelet count 
checked tomorrow on the oncology floor of ___, and then every 
other day at her PCP's office at least until her hematology 
followup appointment.  
.  
# HA - Mild, simliar to prior migraines per pt, though no visual 
changes now. Head CT negative.  Treated with tylenol.  Avoiding 
NSAIDs given thrombocytopenia.
