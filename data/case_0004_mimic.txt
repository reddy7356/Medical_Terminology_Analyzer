ERCP
The scout film showed a plastic stent in place. 
After the stent was pulled, the bile duct was deeply cannulated 
with the sphincterotome. 
Contrast was injected and there was brisk flow through the 
ducts. Contrast extended to the entire biliary tree. 
Once again there was an intra-ampullary stricture 1 cm in 
length. 
There was proximal dilation with the CBD 15 mm in diameter. 
Several small filling defects consistent with stones were 
identified in the distal CBD. 
The left and right hepatic ducts and all intrahepatic branches 
were normal. 
A biliary sphincterotomy was made with a sphincterotome. There 
was no post-sphincterotomy bleeding, but revealed a fleshy 
intra-ampullary component, concerning for a neoplasm. 
The biliary tree was swept with a balloon starting at the 
bifurcation. 
Several small stones were removed. The CBD and CHD were swept 
repeatedly until no further stones were seen. 
Brushings were taken of the intra-ampullary stricture and sent 
for cytology. 
Cold forceps biopsies were performed for histology at the fleshy 
intra-ampullary component.  
The final occlusion cholangiogram showed no evidence of filling 
defects in the CBD. 
Excellent bile and contrast drainage was seen endoscopically and 
fluoroscopically.  
Overall, successful ERCP with sphincterotomy demonstrating 
fleshy intra-ampullary component with associated intra-ampullary 
stricture concerning for neoplasm.  Cytology and biopsies taken.
 
Recommendations: NPO overnight with IV hydration with LR (and/or 
albumin infusions if needed). 
No aspirin, Plavix, NSAIDS, Coumadin for 5 days. 
Continue with antibiotics - Ciprofloxacin 500mg BID x 5 days.

On ___ she received 2 units FFP and 1 unit platelet for 
cirrhosis related coagulopathy and platlets prior to her ERCP 
with sphincterotomy that
demonstrating fleshy intra-ampullary component with associated 
intra-ampullary stricture concerning for neoplasm (  Cytology 
and biopsies).  Following procedure she had abdominal pain, but 
lipase was only 80 so acute pancreatitis was not suspected and 
the day of discharge she had minimal pain and tolerated regular 
diet.

GI was not suprised to see AST and T bili slightly higher and 
are not worried about residual obstruction or complications.  
She understands to be on the look out for abdominal pain and 
signs of bleeding.  She will take oxycodone prn for a few days 
for any residual pain.  She will take cipro for 5 days on 
discharge to prophylaxis of infection and manual measurement of 
qtc did not show prolonged qtc.

# EtOH cirrhosis. Evidence of coagulopathy on labs (INR 1.9), 
thrombocytopenia, and abnormal LFTs c/w known cirrhosis. Follows 
with an outpatient hepatologist. No e/o hepatic encephalopathy 
on exam. Continue home thiamine, rifaximin, 
spironolactone, propranolol, bumex held in hospital for BPs near 
100/50 and because she was NPO but will be restarted on 
discharge.

CHRONIC MEDICAL PROBLEMS:
# CAD s/p stent: Patient not on statin due to allergies, and 
does not appear to be on aspirin. patient explained that her 
usual providers/ardiologist aware that she is off of aspirin as 
she has thrombocytopenia/coagulopathy

# Anxiety/depression: clonazepam 1mg qhs.
# EMERGENCY CONTACT HCP: husband ___, ___

History of Present Illness:
Ms. ___ is a ___ lady with childs ___ class C 
cirrhosis from alcohol and a complicated biliary stricture 
history who is being admitted post-ERCP for monitoring.

She's undergone multiple ERCPs. Dark urine and light stools in 
___ prompted MRCP showing CBD dilation. Her first ERCP that 
month showed distal CBD and PD strictures concerning for 
malignancy though brushings only showed atypical cells. An EUS 
the following month showed thickening PD wall, again raising the 
concern for malignancy though ampulla biopsy showed metaplasia 
and chronic inflammation. A second ERCP in ___ showed again 
ampullary stricture and some stones that were swept, and she 
underwent sphinchterotomy. Brushings from the stricture as well 
as biopsies were sent, with path revealing atypical ductal 
cells. She had a post-sphinchterotomy bleed. Another ERCP 
several days later was done to control bleeding with epinephrine 
injection and stent placement, though she also required ___ 
embolization. A fourth ERCP was in ___ at which time the 
metal stent was removed and a cholangiogram showed no filling 
defects. Brushings and cytology again showed reactive changes, 
no malignancy.

She has continued to experience post prandial epigastric 
discomfort and nausea. Another ERCP was done today due to 
lingering concern for malignancy given ongoing elevation of CA 
___ and mild AP elevation compared to prior values. It showed 
moderate diffuse CBD dilation measuring 12mm, though was 
otherwise normal. The ampulla was biopsied.

Seen on the floor she is in considerable pain and is frustrated. 
Her husband is by her side. She has ___ epigastric pain which 
is similar to the pain that prompted the ERCP but intensified 
considerably post-procedure. She required several doses of IV 
dilaudid in the post-procedure holding area, and achieved some 
relief with a 1mg dose. She has considerable nausea, and felt 
that IV Zofran did not help. She does not wish to answer 
questions currently, but denies fevers, chills, headache, 
diarrhea. She has some mild ___ edema for which she usually takes 
bumex. She has never had pulmonary edema.

ROS: otherwise negative.

IMAGING:
-ERCP (___): A moderate diffuse dilation was seen at the main 
duct with the CBD measuring 12 mm.  Procedures: Cold forceps 
biopsies were performed for histology at the major papilla. 
Impression: Biliary dilation (biopsy) Otherwise normal ercp to 
third part of the duodenum 
-CXR (___): IMPRESSION: In comparison with the study of ___, there is again moderate enlargement of the cardiac 
silhouette without evidence of vascular congestion. This 
discordance raises the possibility of cardiomyopathy.  No 
evidence of acute focal pneumonia or pleural effusion. 
-CXR (___): IMPRESSION: 1. No substantial change compared to 
the prior examination. 2. Enlargement of the pulmonary arteries, 
heart, and the azygos vein is consistent with pulmonary arterial 
hypertension. 3. No evidence of pneumonia or pulmonary edema. 
-CT A/P (___): IMPRESSION: 1. No evidence of hydronephrosis. 
 No findings to suggest pancreatitis. 2. Extrahepatic biliary 
dilatation, with CBD measuring up to 1.5 cm.  Poorly defined 
area of hyperdensity within the mid to distal aspect of the CBD 
could represent a stone.  If there is clinical concern for 
choledocholithiasis or CBD obstruction, further evaluation with 
MRCP is recommended. 3. Bilateral small nonhemorrhagic pleural 
effusions, right greater than left. Moderate bibasilar 
atelectasis. 4. Cholelithiasis without evidence of 
cholecystitis. 
-TTE (___): IMPRESSION: Moderately dilated and hypokinetic 
right ventricle with moderate to severe tricuspid regurgitation 
and severe pulmonary hypertension. Mild symmetric left 
ventricular hypertrophy with hyperdynamic systolic function.  
-CXR (___): IMPRESSION: Compared to prior chest radiographs, 
most recently ___ at 23:37. Pulmonary vasculature is more 
engorged.  New peripheral opacity at the base of the right lung 
could be atelectasis and pleural effusion, but the configuration 
raises concern for infarction due to acute pulmonary embolus.  
No pneumothorax.  Cardiomegaly is moderate and the contour of 
the main pulmonary artery raises possibility of pulmonary 
arterial hypertension. 
-RUQ U/S (___):   IMPRESSION: 1. Cirrhosis with trace 
ascites. 
2. Reversed portal vein flow. Patent hepatic arteries and veins. 

3. Cholelithiasis. Unchanged common bile duct dilation. No 
choledocholithiasis.

Brief Hospital Course:
___ y/o woman with ETOH cirrhosis complicated by hepatic 
encephalopathy, biliary strictures s/p multiple ERCPs, CAD s/p 
stent to LAD ___ who was initially admitted to the ICU 
following ERCP with epigastric pain and hypotension .  Course 
notable for decompensated cirrhosis, NSTEMI, new diagnosis of 
portopulmonary hypertension and RV failure, and eventual 
refractory shock and multi-system failure.  Despite aggressive 
care and initiation of epoprostenol the patient developed 
refractory shock and ongoing GI bleeding.  Given her multi 
system failure and the degree of pulmonary hypertension she was 
not felt to be a candidate for liver transplant as she 
clinically worsened.  Many family meetings were held with ICU 
team, pulmonary HTN team, and hepatology team.  The decision was 
made to pursue comfort measures and the patient died with family 
at the bedside.     

# Hypotension: on ___, patient became acutely hypotensive on 
the floor with SBPs in ___ differential included cirrhotic 
decompensation, with potential trigger including infection (? GI 
or urinary source), mild post-ERCP pancreatitis, pain meds, or 
HRS physiology. CXR without PNA. No ascites on exam. The 
decision was made for FICU transfer. She received IVF 
resuscitation. Blood and urine cultures were sent. She was 
broadened from cipro to vanco/zosyn. A CT A/P was obtained which 
had no acute findings. She was initiated on midodrine 5mg TID.

# Pulmonary hypertension/RV dysfunction: Morning of ___, 
patient developed upper substernal discomfort with rising 
troponin consistent with NSTEMI.  She was continued on aspirin; 
no beta-blocker or anticoagulation were started given patient 
had platelet count of 30 and low SBP.  A repeat ECG was checked 
30min later, which was notable for ___ enlargement. Due to 
concern for PE, she was started on a heparin gtt. A CTA was 
negative for PE and the heparin gtt was stopped. A STAT echo was 
obtained which showed "moderately dilated and hypokinetic right 
ventricle with moderate to severe tricuspid regurgitation and 
severe pulmonary hypertension." Given significantly elevated 
pulmonary arterial hypertension, Dr. ___ was consulted and a 
PA catheter was placed which revealed pulmonary hypertension 
felt to be portopulmonary HTN given known liver disease. Due to 
ongoing RV failure, the decision was made to transfer the 
patient to ___ for initiation of epoprostenol. Patient 
was initiated on epoprostenol and dose was slowly uptitrated 
over time with close monitoring of hemodynamics and oxygenation. 
 Patient was also diuresed with IV Lasix in effort to improve 
volume overload and hemodynamics.  

# Hypoxic respiratory failure: following ERCP, patient became 
mildly hypoxic with O2 sats to low ___ felt to be due to 
splinting/atelectasis.  Throughout her course she had worsening 
oxygenation felt to be multifactorial with contribution of 
pulmonary edema/pleural effusion, atelectasis, possible 
underlying pneumonia, and pulmonary HTN.  On ___ she was 
intubated for hypoxemic respiratory failure and increased GI 
bleeding/altered mental status.

#GI bleeding/Melena: Patient had episodes of melena during MICU 
admission in setting of recent ERCP and thrombocytopenia. She 
was treated supportively with transfusions given high risk for 
EGD in setting of hemodynamic instability and hypoxemic 
respiratory failure.  She eventually developed significant 
bleeding from upper airway requiring packing by ENT.  

#Shock: ___ patient developed shock requiring 3 pressors 
felt to be due to mixed physiology with known RV failure, 
ongoing GI bleeding, and likely septic shock with unclear 
source.  She was treated supportively with vasopressors and 
transfusions.  She eventually developed refractory shock and 
acidemia.  As described above given grim prognosis and the fact 
that she was not a transplant candidate the decision was made to 
pursue comfort measures.    

#Thrombocytopenia/coagulopathy due to underlying cirrhosis and 
DIC.  Treated wiith transfusion support.  

# Post-ERCP pancreatitis: Patient originally presented on ___ 
for ERCP; found to have CBD dilation s/p ampullary biopsy. 
Post-procedure she had persistent abdominal pain, mild elevated 
of lipase to 74. She was treated for presumed pancreatitis; kept 
NPO, received IVF, pain control w/IVF dilaudid. She was then 
transferred to FICU in setting of hypotension as above; she was 
kept NPO with pain control PRN. 

# EtOH Cirrhosis: Childs C. On admission patient was noted to be 
decompensated in the setting of jaundice, ___, hypotension. She 
has a known history of hepatic encephalopathy, no history of 
varices on imaging. She was continued on rifaximin and 
lactulose. A RUQ U/S was notable for reversal of flow in her 
pulmonary vein without evidence of clot.

___ EUS-FNA:
-----------------
-EUS was performed using a linear echoendoscope at ___ MHz 
frequency: The head and uncinate pancreas were imaged from the 
duodenal bulb and the second / third duodenum. The body and tail 
[partially] were imaged from the gastric body and fundus. 
-Pancreas parenchyma: There was lobularity and mild hyperechoic 
strands noted throughout the pancreas. The changes did not meet 
___ criteria for chronic pancreatitis. 
-Pancreas duct: The pancreas duct measured 3 mm in maximum 
diameter in the head of the pancreas and 1.7 mm in maximum 
diameter in the body of the pancreas. The duct was normal in 
echotexture and contour. No intra-ductal stones were noted. No 
dilated side-branches were noted. 
-Bile duct: The bile duct was imaged at the level of the 
porta-hepatis, head of the pancreas and ampulla. The maximum 
diameter of the bile duct was 8 mm. A plastic stent was seen on 
EUS within the bile duct. The distal bile duct wall near the 
ampulla was thickened. This could be secondary to reactive 
changes from stent placement versus a neoplastic process. There 
was sludge noted in the bile duct. (cytology) 
-The ampulla was visualized endoscopically with both the 
echoendoscope as well as a duodenoscope. It appeared markedly 
prominent with the possibility of an intra-ampullary lesion. 
(biopsy)

Studies and pathology from prior admission:
===========================================
PATHOLOGY:
___ CBD brushings: rare highly atypical epithelial cells in 
a background of reactive glandular epithelial cells

___ pathology of papilla biopsy: Duodenal type mucosa with a 
few dilated glands. No evidence of malignancy 

ERCP ___:
A mass-like adenomatous appearance papilla was seen. Forceps 
biopsies were performed from the ampulla for histology. 
Scout film was normal.
The bile duct was deeply cannulated with the sphincterotome.
Contrast was injected and there was brisk flow through the 
ducts. Contrast extended to the entire biliary tree.
There was a 1cm long stricture of the distal CBD and a 8mm long 
stricture of the distal PD.
Double duct sign was noted, suggestive of neoplasm.
The CBD was 15mm in diameter. No filling defects were 
identified.
The PD was 4 mm in diameter. No filling defects were identified.
The left and right hepatic ducts were mildly dilated.
A biliary sphincterotomy was not made due to elevated INR (1.9). 

 
IMAGING:
___ CT abd/pelvis:
-No periampullary lesion is visualized. No significant main 
pancreatic ductal dilatation, which continues to the ampullary 
region. Plastic CBD stent in place with pneumobilia. 
-Generalized stranding of the abdomen and pelvis is noted, which 
may be secondary to portal hypertension rather than soft tissue 
tumor infiltration. Splenorenal shunt. 
-No focal hepatic lesions. 
-Trace right pleural effusion. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs ___ is a ___ yo female with a history of CAD s/p stent 
in ___, EtOH cirrhosis, with recent hyperbilirubinemia who was
