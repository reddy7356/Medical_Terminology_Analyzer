IMAGING:
CXR ___
IMPRESSION:  
Heart size is normal.  Mediastinum is normal. Left retrocardiac 
consolidation and right basal consolidation have substantially 
increased since the previous examination concerning for 
infection or aspiration.  Atelectasis is less likely. 

MRPC ___
IMPRESSION: 
1. Cirrhotic liver morphology with multifocal hepatocellular 
carcinoma. 
2. Previously identified cystic duct stone not well seen on MRI. 
 No MR 
evidence of cholangitis. 
3. Gallbladder is mildly distended with sludge and wall edema, 
findings are nonspecific and could be related to third spacing 
or chronic liver disease, although especially in the setting of 
a cystic duct stone, acutecholecystitis could have a similar 
appearance. 
4. Sequela of portal hypertension with large volume ascites, 
splenomegaly, and varices. 

ECHO ___
The left atrial volume index is normal. The right atrium is 
moderately dilated. Late saline contrast is seen in left heart 
suggesting intrapulmonary shunting. Left ventricular wall 
thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic function are 
normal (LVEF >55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall 
motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear 
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic 
stenosis or aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve appears 
structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is 
mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no 
pericardial effusion. 

IMPRESSION: Mild intrapulmonary shunting. Normal global and 
regional biventricular systolic function. Mild pulmonary 
hypertension.

=====================
___ with HCV/EtOH cirrhosis, HCC, papillary urothelial 
carcinoma, COPD, and thrombocytopenia who presented to ___ 
___ with abdominal pain and shortness of breath with 
significant H/H drop. 

ACTIVE ISSUES:
=============
#ANEMIA
#UPPER GI BLEED
Pt admitted due to concern for GI bleed. Hb dropped during 
hospitalization and patient had episode of melena. EGD was 
performed and showed 1 ___ of grade 11 varices with recent 
stigmata of bleeding and portal gastropathy, that was banded. He 
was treated with IV octreotide, IV PPI, and IV ceftriaxone. He 
remained hemodynamically stable since his procedure. He was 
switched to PO Pantoprazole 40mg daily at the time of discharge.

#ABDOMINAL PAIN
#ABNORAL LFTS
#C DIFF COLITIS
LFTs upon admission with t bili of 4.4 (direct predominant) and 
ALT 133, AST 372. Pt with recent admission for colitis at OSH. 
Repeat CT upon transfer was concerning for colitis and revealed 
a stone in the CBD. Pt likely with component of alcoholic 
hepatitis, but given concern for cholangitis with stone in CBD 
on imaging, zosyn was initiated. MRCP revealed no stone in the 
CBD, and LFTs downtrended, so it was thought that stone likely 
passed. After MRCP, zosyn was changed to ceftriaxone to complete 
course for infection ppx in setting of bleed (7 day course). 
Because of our concern for colitis, C diff was sent and was 
positive so patient was initiated on PO vanc, and ceftriaxone 
was discontinued on ___. His PO lactulose was continued given 
his ongoing abdominal pain and fatigue.

#HYPOXIA
#COPD EXACERBATION
Patient with brief O2 requirement up to 6 L. A LVP was performed 
and hypoxia improved. Because of hypoxia, smoking history and 
wheezing on exam, azithromycin and predisone were initiated to 
complete a five day course for COPD exacerbation on ___. An 
echo with bubble was ordered and revealed mild intrapulmonary 
shunting. 

#CIRRHOSIS:
#Hepatitis C virus:
#ASCITES: 
Childs class C, MELD-Na 21. EtOH and HCV cirrhosis. HCV has not 
been treated. EtOH use ongoing. Has history of ascites and 
hepatic encephalopathy. Noted to have gastric varcies on CT abd 
back in early ___, started on nadolol at that time (though 
now currently is on metoprolol succinate 50mg daily). Diagnostic 
paracenteses was w/o SBP. He underwent and LVP during admission. 
EGD was notable for 1 cord of grade II varices in the lower 
esophagus a well as portal gastropathy. He was restarted on his 
PO diuretics when more hemodynamically stable as well as 
nadolol.

#ETOH ABUSE
Pt with ETOH abuse at home. Pt started on CIWA upon admission, 
but was not scoring.
