History of Present Illness:
___ yo female with history of HTN, HL, and CAD s/p PCI with 
stents ___ years ago presents with substernal chest pressure. She 
notes that she is tired at baseline, but that she has felt 
extreme fatigue x3-4weeks. She has also noticed lightheadedness 
and dizziness and suffered a mechanical fall about ___ weeks 
ago. During this time, she also noticed a sensation of SOB, but 
never had increased work of breathing. Three days ago she saw 
her PCP for this reason and at that point EKG revealed new T 
wave changes different from baseline. D dimer was normal. She 
was scheduled for an outpt stress test on ___. However, she 
developed substernal chest pressure around noon after unloading 
groceries. She notes this was less in severity and a different 
type of pain than the last time she had chest pain when she was 
stented. In ___, she had a painful band like sensation under

# CORONARIES: History of CAD with prior 95% LAD stenosis s/p 
stenting in ___. Her risk factors include HTN, HL, 
postmenopausal female, and recently stopping her statin therapy. 
She has had DOE for the past month, which may be an anginal 
equivalent. She presented with chest pain with T wave changes on

leading to small bowel obstruction with transition point in the

with acute on chronic inflammatory process is not excluded. No

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms ___ is a ___ yo F with a h/o Crohns ileitis c/b 
infrequent flares who presents after sudden onset of crampy abd 
pain, nausea, and anorexia and found to have active terminal 
ileitis and SBO.

1. SBO/ Ileitis
The patient presented to the ED after 8 hours of crampy, diffuse 
abdominal pain that she described as different than her typical 
Crohn's flare. In the ED, the patient had a CT scan that showed 
active terminal ileitis consistent with Crohns, but also a high 
grade SBO with a transition point at the level of the pelvis. On 
the floor, the patient was made NPO, she was given IVFs, IV 
morphine, and IV zofran. The patient was not having emesis, so 
an NGT was not necessary for gastric decompression. GI was 
consulted and they recommended IV cipro and flagyl, but they did 
not think that steroids were necessary because the patient's 
inflammatory markers were not that elevated. On HD#1 she passed 
flatus and had 2 episodes of non-bloody diarrhea and noted 
feeling hungry. Her abdominal exam showed improvement in her 
tenderness hence she was advanced to a clear liquid diet and 
restarted on her home PO pain medication. She endorsed mild 
cramping and nausea with the clear liquid diet and was 
encouraged to advance slowly. On HD#2 she was transitioned to a 
regular diet, PO Cipro Flagyl and per GI recommendation will go 
home with a ___. Neuropathic Facial pain
This is a chronic problem for Ms. ___ and was exacerbated 
by the fact that she was kept strictly NPO on hospital day 0. A 
pain consult was called and an attempt to manage her pain on IV 
morphine was unsuccessful. On hospital day #2 she was started on 
her PO medications of cymbalta, sertraline, carbamezapine, and 
methadone and her pain was better controlled.

3. Anemia
She was found to have a HCT of 34 on her initial labs, Iron 
studies was consistent with anemia of chronic inflammation and 
no intervention was done.

4. Hypertension
Her Exforge was held throughout the hospitalization and she 
remained normotensive. 
She was discharged on no anti-hypertensives and advised to 
follow up with her PCP regarding management.

Transition of care issues: 
Re-evaluate the need for anti-hypertensive
The patient had follow-up with both her PCP and with her 
gastroenterologist, Dr. ___

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted to the hospital with abdominal pain that was 
determined to be a result of an obstruction of the small bowel 
likely secondary to your Crohn's Disease. While you were here, 
we initially kept you without food, gave you fluids, and IV 
medications. As your pain improved and you were passing gas, we 
were able to successfully restart your diet and your home 
medications. Your pain was very much improved on discharge. I 
just want to reiterate that you may not feel 100% for a few 
days. Please take it slowly with your diet and also with your 
activity.

You will continue the cipro and flagyl for 10 days total. After 
that finishes, you can start back on your Keflex. We also have 
held your ExForge while here and your BP have been normal. You 
can check your BP at home and restart the med if it is high, or 
you can wait and discuss with your doctor. I would hold your 
Iron pill until you are passing regular stools, as this can make 
you more constipated.

If you develop worsening abdominal pain, nausea, or vomiting, 
please call Dr. ___.

The following medication was STARTED:
Cipro 500mg by mouth every 12 hours for 6 more days (last dose 
on ___
Flagyl 500mg by mouth every 8 hours for 6 more days (last dose

pressures over 130/80 at home
