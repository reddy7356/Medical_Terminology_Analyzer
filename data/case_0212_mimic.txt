Brief Hospital Course:
The patient is a ___ year old female with hypertension and 
significant anxiety about her family history of myocardial 
infarctions who presented with an episode of near syncope in the 
setting of possible mild dehydration, and exertion, admitted for 
rule out myocardial infarction.

#1. Near Syncope: We suspected that this could have been due to 
a recent diarrheal illness one week prior to presentation, in 
addition to diuretic use, in setting of exertion.  
- The patient was admitted to telemetry, with no events noted 
during the first hospital day.  Serial cardiac enzymes were done 
and found to be negative x3.
- Records were obtained from her primary care provider's office 
and revealed that the EKG findings seen on admission are the 
patient's baseline without acute changes.  In addition, review 
of these records showed an outpatient stress test that was done 
in the past year which was normal. 
- Daily ASA was continued; the patient's chest pain resolved and 
she felt entirely well during the first hospital day without any 
further intervention.

#2. Hypertension, hyperlipidemia, GERD: We continued the 
patients home medications for GERD and HTN.  As the patient was 
not sure of her simvastatin dose, this was held for her one day 
of hospitalization.    

#3. Iron deficiency anemia: Continued the patient's home po iron 
supplementation.

#4. Multinodular goiter: Continued the patient's levothyroxine. 
Recent TFTs done by PCP were found to be within normal limits. 

#5. Seasonal allergies: Continued the patient's home loratidine  


#6. Hyperglycemia on labs: on initial labs which was found to 
resolve on HD#1 labs. HgbA1c found to be normal at 5.9.
