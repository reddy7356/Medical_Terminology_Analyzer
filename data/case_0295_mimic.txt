IMAGING:
========
Lower extremity US (___): Deep venous thrombosis involving the 
left common femoral vein with extension into the proximal 
greater saphenous vein.  Subcutaneous edema within the left 
lower extremity. No evidence of right lower extremity deep 
venous thrombosis.

CTAP w/ contrast (___): 1. Partially occlusive deep vein 
thrombosis of left common iliac vein is
identified.  The thrombosis extends into the external iliac and 
common femoral veins. Right common iliac vein and IVC are 
patent. IVC filter is in place. 2. Uterine endometrial appears 
fluid distended, consider nonemergent pelvic ultrasound for 
further evaluation for any endometrial pathology.

CXR (___): Mild left base atelectasis.  Possible very minimal 
interstitial edema.

Pelvic US (___): 1. Evaluation of the endometrial echotexture 
is limited.  Endometrium thickness of 7 mm does not warrant 
further workup unless there is history of vaginal bleeding.  If 
patient has vaginal bleeding, endometrium would be considered 
thickened in a postmenopausal patient and gynecological 
evaluation would be recommended.

who p/w worsening LLE pain, redness, and swelling x2 days, found 
to have extensive of DVT to Lt common iliac and cellulitis. 

ACUTE ISSUES:
=============
# Recurrent deep venous thrombosis: 
Pt with hx of provoked DVT, PE iso spinal surgery (s/p IVC 
filter) in ___ on Xarelto, p/w 2d of worsening LLE swelling, 
redness, and pain found to have extension of DVT into Lt common 
iliac vein.  last colonscopy > ___ years, mammogram unsure ? "a 
few years", ovaries/uterus intact. No recent weight changes, 
bowels normal. husband states she is quite sedentary. Hematology 
oncology was consulted for assistance with choosing and 
anticoagulation agent. She was initially started on heparin drip 
which was transitioned to Lovenox, and she underwent a bridge to 
warfarin. Continued daily dosing of warfarin based on INR

#Left lower extremity cellulitis: 
Likely cellulitis on LLE given elevated WBC, focal area of 
erythema below knee. Initially on vanc/CTX but had rash so CTX 
was dc'ed after 1 day. Then on vanc/levo, which was narrowed to 
Bactrim on ___. However, rash worsened off the vanc and 
leukocytosis returned and appearance of 2 cm blister so was 
restarted on vanc/bactrim/flagyl on ___, which was then 
narrowed to vancomycin on ___. Treated with IV vancomycin 
until ___ at which point she was transitioned to clindamycin 
450mg
QID based on ID recommendations. 

# Rash: 
Was noted to have diffuse papular pink rash on bilateral arms 
and back on ___ which was pleuritic, no blistering
lesions, which is likely secondary to an autoeczematization 
reaction  in the setting of the cellulitis versus reaction to
Vancomycin. Hydrocortisone cream as needed.

# Incidentally found uterine distended endometrial cavity. 
US with nonspecific findings of 7 mm endometrial wall. Further 
work-up only if complaining of post-menopausal bleeding

CHRONIC ISSUES:
===============
# Hypertension: Patient unsure if she take HCTZ. SBP was 120's 
on arrival.
Will hold for now

- Changed Meds:  None
- Follow-up appointments: PCP after rehab discharge
- Post-Discharge follow-up Labs Needed: Last hgb 11.3, cr 0.6, 
and inr 2.9. Please recheck INR everyday until on a stable 
warfarin regimen.
- Incidental Findings:  Endometrial thickness 7 mm. Will need 
biopsy if develops symptoms of postmenopausal bleeding (no 
bleeding this admission).
