The patient states that as of late she has been spending more 
and more time laid-up in bed with worsening depression.  She 
cannot quantify exactly when this started however, roughly 2 
weeks ago she developed worsening dizziness and SOB with minimal 
exertion, unrelieved by her baseline 4L of oxygen with activity. 
 She also noted that she has had non-productive, non-bloody 
cough over the same time period and may have felt her heart 
"fluttering."  This morning she was seen in her "psychopharm" 
clinic, and her provider urged her to go to urgent care.  In

Pertinent Results:
CT abdomen Pelvis:
IMPRESSION: 
  
1. Bilateral pulmonary embolism involving at least the right 
pulmonary artery 
and right and left lobar pulmonary arteries. 
  
2. No evidence of ischemic or inflammatory changes within the 
bowel. There 
are small retroperitoneal lymph nodes, which may be reactive. 
  
Findings of bilateral pulmonary emboli were discussed with Dr. 
___ at 
the time of interpretation. 
  
  

 
Brief Hospital Course:
Bilateral PE's. - Patient with large, central b/l PE's.  The 
only etiology possible in her history is decreased ambulation 
and venous stasis in the setting of her depression c/b obesity.  
She is no longer an active smoker, she is UTD on her cancer 
screening and has not presented with an obvious 
hypercoagulability thus far in her life.  As her renal function 
improved, we decied to go with lovenox bridge to coumadin.
.
Plan going forward:
- Patient to follow-up with PCP to establish ___ in a ___ 
clinic 
.
Tachycardia:  Patient was newly tachycardic for the first time 
on the day of discharge.  She was euvolemic and her bp was up to 
130/70, and her HCT was stable making hypovolemia unlikely.  
Instead we believed that now that when her renal function 
improved she cleared her atenolol and began responding 
appropriately to her PE.
- We started metoprolol at 25 BID with reduction in her heart 
rate. She should be switched to 50mg Metoprolol ER QD tomorrow 
morning.
.
Plan going forward:
- would have patient discuss changing atenolol to metoprolol SR 
given her renal faillure.
.
Hypotension:  resolved
.
Depression: We continued her home regimen, and encouraged her to 
have close follow-up with her o/p provider for this as 
depression may have set this off in the first place.
.  
ILD: The patient's oxygen requirement was stable in house and we 
continued her home prednisone, azathioprine, bactrim, and 
oxygen.

hypothyroidism, ILD on home O2, prior PE not on AC, and 
pancreatic cancer on chemotherapy who presented to ___ ED with 
complaints of nausea (no vomiting), diarrhea, and crampy 
abdominal pain.  

Patient was in usual state of health until ~2 weeks ago, and had 
finished her last cycle of chemoradiation on ___. ~ 2 weeks ago 
she noted intermittent palpitations, without chest pain or SOB, 
without clear precipitating factors. Shortly after she noted 
diarrhea, described as reddish-brown, mucusy, and more forceful 
than the diarrhea she had had previously with chemotherapy; with 
associated nausea without vomiting responsive to Zofran, and 
some crampy abdominal pain. She had some associated 
lightheadedness and polyuria, without dysuria. No recent travel 
or prolonged immobilization, no recent injury to legs or 
anywhere else. Has a chronic cough and had some chills 
associated with diarrhea, no fevers or new cough/congestion. 
Because of concern for the intensity of her symptoms, she 
decided to come into the ED for evaluation. 

In ED initial VS: 96.7 79/59 99 18 97/NC  
Exam: Tachy reg rhythm; CTABL; soft ntnd; CN ___ intact; 
Rectal: brown stool 

Labs notable for:

WBC 12.4, hb 9.7
nl coags
no e/o infection on UA

Imaging notable for:  
-CTA: 
1. There is a thrombus seen within the left main pulmonary 
artery which is seen extending into the lingula left lower lobe. 
Chronicity is uncertain due to lack of contrast enhanced prior 
exams, although patient has history of pulmonary embolus.
2. There is similar appearance of a known pancreatic cystic mass 
along the pancreatic body and tail, compared to the prior study 
in ___.
3. 7.0 x 3.6 x 3.6 cm fluid collection is seen at the level of 
the right greater trochanter, possibly representing bursal 
fluid.
-CXR: Pulmonary fibrosis is noted left greater than right with 
similar distribution as compared with the prior CT chest. No 
definite signs of a superimposed pneumonia though evaluation is 
somewhat limited given background lung disease. No large 
effusion or pneumothorax. Heart is at least top-normal in size. 
Mediastinal contour appears unremarkable though there is an 
unfolded and partially calcified thoracic aorta noted. Bony 
structures are intact. No free air below the right 
hemidiaphragm. 
-EKG: wide-complex tachycardia, HR 130, right-axis deviation, 
and RBBB; tachycardia initially irregular with HR ~150 bpm then 
sinus tachycardia at ~100 bpm.

Consults: Cardiology: would not treat heart rate specifically. 
Instead would investigate for underlying cause of tachycardia 
and treat accordingly. Tachycardia likely responsive. 
Addendum: found to have PE, recommend MASCOT evaluation in AM 
for further management.  

Patient was given 3L NS, dextrose, and started on heparin GTT 

VS prior to transfer: 98.7 123/56 110 26 98/nc 
 
On arrival to the MICU, patient reports some abdominal cramping 
and R leg cramping, but otherwise feels well.

IMAGING:

___ CTA CHEST/ABDOMEN  
1. There is a thrombus seen within the left main pulmonary 
artery which is 
seen extending into the lingula left lower lobe.  There is mild 
right heart 
strain with pulmonary artery hypertension. 
2. known pancreatic mass along the pancreatic body with 
dilatation of the main 
pancreatic duct for which further evaluation with MRI/MRCP may 
be performed. 
3. Interstitial lung disease is again seen in the upper lobes 
and lower lobes 
bilaterally with superimposed opacities which are concerning for 
multifocal 
infection. 
4. Ovoid fluid collection measuring 7 x 3.6 cm of abutting the 
right greater 
trochanter for which percutaneous drainage may be performed to 
exclude 
infection.  No CT evidence for osteomyelitis at this time. 

___ CXR
AP portable upright view of the chest. 
Pulmonary fibrosis is noted left greater than right with similar 
distribution as compared with the prior CT chest.  No definite 
signs of a superimposed pneumonia though evaluation is somewhat 
limited given background lung disease. 
No large effusion or pneumothorax.  Heart is at least top-normal 
in size.  
Mediastinal contour appears unremarkable though there is an 
unfolded and 
partially calcified thoracic aorta noted.  Bony structures are 
intact.  No 
free air below the right hemidiaphragm. 
IMPRESSION: As above. 

___ TTE
The left atrium is elongated. There is mild symmetric left 
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and 
regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%). The right 
ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with mild global free wall 
hypokinesis. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened 
but aortic stenosis is not present. Mild (1+) mitral 
regurgitation is seen. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is 
seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. 
There is no pericardial effusion. 
 IMPRESSION: Symmetric LVH with normal global and regional 
biventricular systolic function. Mild mitral regurgitation. 
Moderate pulmonary hypertension.
 Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of ___, 
there is more tricuspid regurgitation and esimated pulmonary 
pressures are higher, consistent with the given interim history 
of pulmonary embolism.  

Discharge Labs:
___ 08:48AM BLOOD ___ PTT-70.6* ___
 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ with h/o HTN, HLD, RBBB, T2DM, CKD (baseline Cr 1.6), 
hypothyroidism, ILD on home O2, prior PE not on AC, and 
pancreatic cancer on chemotherapy who was admitted to MICU w/ PE 
and ?pneumonia, as well as hypotension (resolved in MICU) and 
diarrhea of unknown source, then transferred to floor for mgmt 
of PE and diarrhea.

=====================
ACUTE ISSUES
=====================

# Pulmonary embolus:
Patient presented to MICU with hypotension, with mild trop leak, 
tachycardia. Tachycardia and hypotension responsive to fluids, 
with resolution of hemodynamic instability. CTA demonstrated 
large thrombus in L main pulmonary artery, however, after 
reviewing with a multidisciplinary cardiology and pulmonary 
team, it was thought that her tachycardia and hypotension were 
more likely related to her GI symptoms / hypovolemia than to her 
PE. Furthermore, the chronicity of her PE was unclear from her 
imaging and it was thought that the PE may not have been acute 
at the time of presentation. Her O2 requirement was at baseline 
and as below her tachycardia/hypotension responded promptly to 
IVF. Echo ___ showed increased tricuspid regurg, incr estimated 
pulm pressures, c/w recent PE; but no thrombus in transit. She 
was started on a heparin gtt ___ which was transitioned to 
Lovenox 1mg/kg BID ___. This is second PE (first in ___ so 
will need lifelong A/C. Per Dr. ___ transition 
to Lovenox with target antiXa level 0.6-1. We titrated Lovenox 
dose to 70mg BID, but supratherapeutic ___ antiXa level 1.44) 
and hard to titrate to correct antiXa range given fluctuating 
renal function so Lovenox d/c'ed. Starting ___ began warfarin 
with heparin drip as bridge. Final warfarin regimen is 5 mg 
daily for target INR ___.

# SVT
Per MASCOT note ___ was found to have SVTs i/s/o PE. Recorded 
SVT episode 0200 ___, broke with metoprolol 5mg IV followed by 
metoprolol 6.25mg PO Q6H. Seems likely to be an AVNRT given most 
severe episode on ___ found to be started and stopped by PACs. 
Patient was on metoprolol tartrate 6.25mg PO Q6H from ___, 
started on metoprolol succinate 25mg PO ___, uptitrated to 
metoprolol succinate 50mg PO ___.

# Hypotension, tachycardia: Patient presented hypotensive to 
79/59 and tachycardic. Hypotension and tachycardia were 
responsive to 3L IVF, suggesting component of 
diarrhea/hypovolemia. While in the MICU her BPs were stable with 
SBPs in 120s, and patient remained normotensive on the floor.

# Crampy abdominal pain 
# Nausea/Vomiting/Diarrhea
# Leukocytosis
No acute findings on CT abdomen c/f intrabdominal pathology. 
Legionella negative. C. diff negative. Stool cultures negative. 
Her diarrhea may have been due to a viral gastroenteritis which 
improved during her stay. Pt was c. diff/noro negative and 
responded to loperamide. Loperamide changed to PRN ___ after no 
BM for 3 days. Patient did not have diarrhea after ___, and 
required senna for regular BM.

# ? CAP
Patient has had chronic cough since onset of diarrhea, as well 
as CT chest findings concerning for infectious process. 
Legionella urine antigen negative. Patient received benzonatate 
and CAP coverage with ceftriaxone (___) and azithromycin 
(___).

# ___
Cr 1.9 from baseline 1.6 likely prerenal, ___ resolved and Cr 
returned to baseline with fluids.

=====================
CHRONIC ISSUES
=====================

# ILD
Patient with known ILD on 3L@rest/5L@walking home O2. She 
remained on baseline O2 despite PE. Continued prednisone 10mg 
daily, loratadine, albuterol nebs PRN. 

# Pancreatic cancer: Has known pancreatic adenocarcinoma stage 
IB (T2N0M0). Started on chemoradiation with capecitabine 1500 mg 
PO BID M-F ___ - ___.  Continued APAP, oxycodone PRN for 
pain control, Zofran for nausea. 

# Anemia: close to recent baseline. 

# Hypothyroidism: continue synthroid

# DM2: held glipizide and repaglinide, HISS while inpatient

# HTN: Valsartan held ISO PE w/ hypotension, continued to hold 
because started on metop succinate 50mg PO QD.

# HLD/cardioprotection: Continued Atorvastatin, ASA

# Psych: continued lorazepam, risperidone, bupropion, 
escitalopram

# GERD: continued omeprazole

- Called PCP regarding transition: next month patient's PCP ___ 
retire and she will be transferred to care of new PCP hire ___ 
(in hiring process).
- We appreciate the PCP office referral to Cardiology for

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,

WHY WAS I ADMITTED TO THE HOSPITAL?
- you had diarrhea and was not drinking enough fluids, leading 
to dehydration and low blood pressure
- when you came to the hospital you were also found to have a 
blood clot in your lungs

WHAT WAS DONE FOR ME IN THE HOSPITAL?
- you received fluids and supportive care until your diarrhea 
resolved and your blood pressure returned to normal
- you also received blood thinners to dissolve the clot in your 
lungs
- you were started on long-term blood thinners (warfarin) to 
prevent future clots
- while in the hospital you were found to have a new heart 
arrhythmia related to the clot in your lung, which we are 
treating with a medication (Metoprolol) to slow down your heart 
rate. Your PCP's office will set you up with a Cardiologist to 
further manage your new heart condition.

WHAT SHOULD I DO WHEN I GO BACK TO ASSISTED LIVING?
It is very important to drink more fluids so that you can stay 
hydrated and prevent your blood pressure from dropping. We have 
arranged for your visiting nurse to weigh you regularly to make 
sure you are taking enough in, and to check labs to make sure 
you blood is thin enough on warfarin. Please continue to take 
your Metoprotol for your heart arrhythmia.

Do not restart your valsartan until you discuss with your 
primary doctor. 

It was a pleasure being involved in your care.

Sincerely,
Your ___ Team
