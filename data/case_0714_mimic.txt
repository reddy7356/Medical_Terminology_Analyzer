Pertinent Results:
Transesophageal Echocardiogram ___
PREBYPASS 
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left 
ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular 
cavity size is normal. Regional left ventricular wall motion is 
normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal 
(LVEF>55%). [Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is 
likely more depressed given the severity of valvular 
regurgitation.] Right ventricular chamber size and free wall 
motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly 
thickened. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve 
leaflets are moderately thickened. The mitral valve leaflets are 
myxomatous. There is moderate/severe bileaflet leaflet mitral 
valve prolapse (P2 and A3)

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ was admitted on ___ and was taken to the 
operating room. She underwent a mitral valve repair. Please see 
the operative note for full details. She tolerated the procedure 
well and was transferred to the CVICU in stable condition for 
recovery and invasive monitoring. 
  
Ms. ___ weaned from sedation, awoke neurologically intact 
and was extubated on POD 1. She was weaned from inotropic and 
vasopressor support. She arrived to the intensive care unit 
without a cardiac rhythm under her temporary pacing wires. Beta 
blockade was therefore held and with time her rhythm slowly 
recovered. She was diuresed toward her preoperative weight. She 
remained hemodynamically stable and was transferred to the 
telemetry floor for further recovery. She was evaluated by the 
physical therapy service for assistance with strength and 
mobility. She was noted for junctional rhythm and betablockers 
were stopped.  EP was consulted over few days her rhythm 
returned to sinus rhythm and was restarted on betablocker.  
Epicardial wires were removed and she was discharge home with 
services.
