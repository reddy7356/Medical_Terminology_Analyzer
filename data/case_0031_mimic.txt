History of Present Illness:
Patient is a ___ year old married man with prior diagnosis of 
depression and medical history significant for HTN, DM, and CAD, 
family history of schizophrenia and BPAD, who is brought in by 
his wife after his PCP suggested that he appeared manic and in 
need of psychiatric evaluation.  
. 
On initial interview in the ED, the patient was noted to be  
pressured, intrusive, tangential, paranoid, and agitated on 
approach, difficult to follow and obviously angry at having been 
brought to the hospital, saying "I'm not crazy!  This is the 
human condition, man!", adding "Why shouldn't a person be
allowed to dance on tables?" While initially uncooperative with 
care, he does eventually allow medical evaluation, including 
screening labs and NCHCT, none of which reveal obvious acute 
abnormalities.  History is obtained primarily from his wife, 
___, present at the bedside. 
. 
Per the patient's wife, a nurse, ___ has "always been 
irritable, with a lot of depression for most of his life and 
some manic episodes recently"; she says "I didn't realize it 
until now, but I think he's bipolar", describing how, for the 
last several months, the patient has appeared agitated, 
argumentative,
grandiose, goal-driven, and impulsive, with decreased need for 
sleep.  She says that he was laid off his job as an ___ 
___ in ___ of last year after having "yelled at his boss" 
and believes that his symptoms have gradually worsened since 
that time.  She states that he currently spends the majority of 
his time smoking marijuana in the basement while obsessing over 
___, though he has in the last few days incessantly 
posted nonsensical, grandiose, or paranoid statements on 
Facebook- declaring, for example, "his goal to save humanity", 
or stating "they're out to get me"- which has caused his friends
concern; note that the patient requested to "friend" this writer 
on Facebook during the course of the interview.  ___ states 
that the patient recently insisted on driving separately to his 
granddaughter's school recital in case "he needed to get away in 
a hurry", afraid an unidentified party was following him.
. 
___ additionally describes how the patient will pace the 
house for 30 minutes at a time, only occasionally sitting down, 
appearing "catatonic", still and staring straight ahead, mute, 
for up to 15 minutes.  If their eldest daughter, age ___ and 
diagnosed with bipolar disorder, is home, ___ states that the 
patient will follow her about the house "talking non-stop".  She
notes that yesterday "he only talked in rhymes".  She is unsure 
whether he has been compliant with zolpidem for sleep, retiring 
to bed at 4:30 AM and rising at 8:00 AM for the past few months. 
 She ultimately brought him to the ED not only for his 
disorganization but inability to care for self, noting that he
now requires prompting to shower and will only eat when she 
prepares and places food in front of him.  
. 
She says that, while the patient has in the last ___ years 
experienced numerous episodes of depression, he refuses to 
accept medications, clarifying "he's in denial".  Though he has 
never been diagnosed with bipolar disorder she recounts how, 
___ years ago, he flew to ___ and spent $1,000 on souvenirs, 
spending $8,000 on souvenirs while traveling through ___ ___ 
years ago.  She further describes how, when angry, the patient 
will "throw things, throw things out of the house" recalling an 
episode last ___ in which he threw a cup which struck her in 
the head resulting in a laceration requiring multiple sutures-
her children, alarmed, called the police, who arrested the 
patient and charged him with simple assault.  His current legal 
status remains unclear.
. 
The patient initially greets this writer with hostility when 
told that he will be hospitalized shouting "You'd better give me 
a lobotomy, or kill me, 'cause if you don't turn this thing 180 
degrees there'll be hell to pay!" but eventually accepts his 
disposition, rounding on his wife to say "It's better that I get 
out of that INSANE house- the two of you are CRAZY!", referring
to his wife and daughter.  He initially claims he does not trust 
this writer but changes his mind after inquiring as to the 
origin of my surname, saying "Those are good people!  
Trustworthy people!  Will you promise to come back and talk to 
me so I can tell you what I'm really about?"
. 
Course in Emergency Department: Patient did not take any 
medications. He did not require any chemical restraints. He was 
notable to be irritable at times but otherwise cooperative.

Brief Hospital Course:
#. Legal/Safety: Patient admitted to ___ 4 on a ___ initially upon admission he declined to sign a conditional 
voluntary agreement (section 10 & 11) but later signed a CV with 
several 3 day notices. Patient maintained his safety throughout 
his admission on 15 minute checks and did not require physical 
or chemical restraints. He was noted to be somewhat disruptive 
in the milieu at times and somewhat intrusive at times but he 
was redirectable with no unsafe behaviors. Of note, patient did 
sign a 3 day notice that expired on the day of discharge. Given 
his compliance with medication, significant improvement in his 
disorganized thought process, consistent denial of suicidal 
ideation or thoughts of self harm, he did not meet criteria to 
file a 7&8b. 
.
#. Bipolar disorder, manic episode with psychotic features
- Patient initially presented with mania with psychotic features 
characterized by decreased need for sleep, racing thoughts, 
pressured speech, impulsivity, paranoia, and persecutory 
delusions; per his wife, he had experienced numerous episodes of 
depressions and two episodes of mania in the past suggesting a 
diagnosis of bipolar disorder rather than a historical diagnosis 
of unipolar depression. 
- After discussion of the risks and benefits, we initially 
started risperidone that was eventually converted to 
paliperidone and titrated up to 9 mg po qhs. He tolerated this 
medication well with some complaints of headache that responded 
well to prn Tylenol. Of note, we did discuss the pros and cons 
of starting a long acting injectable, which the patient declined 
during this hospitalization 
- Given manic symptoms, we also discussed the risks and benefits 
of lithium and the patient was amenable to a trial. lithium was 
started at 300 mg po qhs, which he tolerated well without 
complaints of side effects. Lithium level on ___ was 0.7. 
- For insomnia, patient was stated on Valium ___ mg po qhs with 
significant improvement in sleep
- Of note, the patient was compliant in attending groups and was 
occasionally disruptive and intrusive but with no unsafe 
behaviors. In the setting of the structure of the unit and on 
the above medications, the patient's condition improved 
significantly-- mood lability, agitation, irritability improved 
as did his sleep. Thought process became significantly more 
organized, linear, goal oriented with some improvement in his 
insight. Of note, he consistently denied suicidal ideation, 
thoughts of self harm, or harm to others during his 
hospitalization. In addition, he attended to his ADL's 
appropriately-- no evidence that he would be unable to care for 
himself. 
- Prior to discharge a family meeting was held and his wife 
agreed that his condition had improved and felt safe having him 
return home. Patient and his wife were counseled extensively on 
the importance of following up with outpatient treaters and 
continuing his medications as prescribed. 
.
#. Cannabis use disorder
Patient was counseled on the importance of cessation given the 
potential that significant daily marijuana use may have been 
contributing to his psychiatric presentation. Patient reported 
he would abstain from cannabis use.
