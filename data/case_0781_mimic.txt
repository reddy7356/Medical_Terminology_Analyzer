Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ is a ___ w/ h/o laryngeal ca who unfortunately is 
being admitted to the hospital with N/V and dehydration after a 
recent administration of chemotherapy.  
 
#. N/V- Patient's repeated presentations likely related to 
chemotherapy induced nausea and vomiting which has persisted 
despite a change in chemotherapy regiment o ___.  His 
nausea and vomiting had largely resolved by the time he was 
admitted to the oncology floor.  He was started with a regimen 
of IV compazine/ativan with zyprexa.  Ativan and zyprexa were 
the most effective agents.  The patient was transitioned to a PO 
regimen which was given through the G tube.  He was unable to 
tolerate PO because of throat pain but his tube feeds were 
successfully restarted.  However, he had residual nausea with 
around 1 emesis daily over the next two days.  His TF rate was 
decreased from 120cc/h to 105cc/h and this issue resolved by 
time of discharge even though he never had high residuals.  
 
#. Mucositis - Patient had significantly increased throat pain 
this admission with diffuse exudates across his soft palate down 
into the throat.  This was likely triggered by his XRT.  
However, the patient had previously been able to tolerate food 
or medications PO but was unable to do so this admission because 
of the pain.  He was treated with local therapy using magic 
mouthwash, nystatin, and caphosol.  He was sometimes reluctant 
to take these therapies because of the pain associated with 
them.  He was given oxycodone and tyelnol through his G tube for 
the pain.  The remainder of his PO medications were given 
through the G tube due to throat pain.  
 
#. Fever - The patient had a single temperature of 100.5.  Blood 
cultures, UA, and CXR were unrevealing for a source of 
infection.  The patient had a G tube cellulitis which appeared 
to be responding to treatment.  His fever was attributed to the 
above mucositis. 

#. Fall - The patient experienced a mechanical fall while trying 
to reach the bathroom.  He was on significant amounts of 
oxycodone, zyprexa, and IV ativan at the time which were thought 
to be the precipitant.  He had head strike without LOC and had 
no neurologic defecits on exam some a CT head was not obtained.  
       

# G-tube site infection/cellulits- patient had been on 
outpatient treatment with Amox/Clav.  He was continued with 
Amp/Sulbactam upon arrival and transitioned back to Amox/Clav 
when his vomiting had improved and he was able to tolerate 
medications by NG tube. 
 
#. Laryngeal ca- Regimen recently changed to ___.  
Consider changing his antiemetic regimen following further 
chemotherapy.

laryngeal squamous cell cancer, on chemotherapy, status post 
G-tube placement, presenting with nausea and vomiting.

1.  Nausea and Vomiting:  This is most likely a side effect of
his chemotherapy regimen with a 5-day delay being typical of
cisplatin.  He had normal LFTs on ___, so this is
unlikely be related to a biliary or hepatic process.  He had a 
CT
of the head that was not concerning for any acute process that
would be responsible for neurogenic nausea and vomiting.  His
symptoms were controlled with Compazine, Ativan and Zyprexa as
well as promotility agent such as Reglan.  He was able to resume
a regular diet, and tolerated his tube feeds without difficulty
with the above antiemetic regimen.  His chemotherapy regimen was
altered to avoid cisplatin to mitigate the side effects in the
future.

2.  Laryngeal cancer:  As above, the patient presents with
recurrent nausea and vomiting likely induced by cisplatin
chemotherapy.  We are in touch with his outpatient oncologist,
and we decided to switch his chemotherapy regimen to carboplatin
and Taxol, which the patient should be able to tolerate with 
less
side effects.  He received his first dose of this medication
while inpatient and did not have any nausea or vomiting 
following
his dose.

3.  Nutrition:  The patient has a PEG tube in place.  Nutrition
was consulted and made recommendations regarding his tube 
feeding
regimen, which he was able to tolerate without the need of any
additional antiemetics.  His PEG tube site did not appear to 
have any surrounding cellulitis.

Brief Hospital Course:
A ___ man with a history of laryngeal cancer readmitted
to the hospital with nausea and vomiting and dehydration
following recent administration of chemotherapy.

1.  Nausea and vomiting:  Most likely chemo related, although
less severe than with his previous regimen of cisplatin.  Given
that he only presented with one day of vomiting four to five
times, his outpatient providers decided to continue his current
regimen of carboplatin and Taxol.  After admission to the
hospital, the patient's nausea and vomiting were well controlled
with p.o. antiemetics and he did not have any further episodes 
of
nausea or vomiting.  His tube feeds were restarted and he was
allowed to take clears p.o. and he tolerated this diet without
any difficulty.

2.  Laryngeal cancer:  The patient received his second dose of
carboplatin and Taxol while he was admitted on ___. 
He will require standing antiemetic regimen with taper as
reproduced below:
compazine q6hours standing starting day 2 after chemo
dexamethasone 4mg PO BID starting Day 2 after chemo.
stading zyprexa bid x 5 days then cont prn as below
ativan ___ q4-6h prn nausea and standing before bed
zyprexa 2.5 to ___ disintigrating prn nausea q8hr

3.  Nutrition:  PEG tube was in place and his current home tube 
feed
regimen was continued per nutrition recommendations.

4.  Elevated ___ and PTT:  This was initially attributed to
subcutaneous heparin administration.  His heparin was decreased
to b.i.d. and then discontinued.  However, his ___ and PTT
remained prolonged and review of his medical records showed that
they had been prolonged for as long as he had been tested in our
hospital system.  A fibrinogen was checked to ensure that there
was no consumptive process and was normal.  An inhibitor screen
was sent, especially in consideration of his history of
autoimmune hemolytic anemia, which was still pending at time of 
discharge.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
- followup inhibitor screen and coags
- close outpatient f/u with orthostatics and hydration as needed
