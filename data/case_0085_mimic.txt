Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ is a ___ with h/o HIV (CD4 162) and CVA presenting 
with cough and fever found to have cavitary pneumonia and MSSA 
positive sputum.

# MSSA pneumonia ___ immunocompromised host: As evident on CXR 
and pt's symptoms of productive cough, fever, and chills. 
Notably not hypoxic. Given pt's history of HIV and very low CD4 
count (<200), there was concern for both common bacterial 
infection as well as oppotunistic infections including PCP, 
___, fungal. He did not report TB exposure or risk factors and 
CXR not c/f TB infection. Based on imaging findings, ___ was 
also considered (had some bilateral findings, but patient's CD4 
count not ___ the range where this is typically a concern, and 
AFB smear negative) vs. aspiration. Since pt has CD4 count < 200 
and has not been on PCP prophylaxis, he was briefly placed on 
bactrim therapy for PCP, as well as initially covered with 
vancomycin, ceftriaxone and azithromycin. Another consideration 
was malignancy and supported by weight loss and significant 
history of smoking. Repeat CXR on morning after admission showed 
cavitary lesion which was better shown on Chest CT without 
contrast. ___ conjunction with cavitary lesion ___ right mid-lung, 
this was suspicious for staph pneumonia, potentially 
post-influenza as patient provided history of viral prodrome, 
however influenza PCR was negative while inpatient. Eventually, 
sputum culture from OSH grew MSSA. He was then narrowed to 
nafcillin for MSSA pneumonia with the help of Infectious Disease 
consultation. He underwent both TTE and TEE to rule out 
endocarditis given high-grade bacteremia, and these were both 
negative. There was no evidence of peripheral stigmata or 
complications from endocarditis. Therefore, after placement of a 
PICC line, he was discharged on a course of nafcillin for 4 
weeks with plans to follow-up ___ ___ clinic.

# Diarrhea: Weeks ___ duration, per patient, with associated 
weight loss of 10 lbs over the past month. Has been intermittent 
with HAART therapy, which places him at risk for additional 
pathogens, especially with CD4 < 200. This prompted concern for 
cryptosporidiosis given dehydration, electrolyte disturbances 
(hypokalemia), and weight loss, however this test was negative. 
This could also have been antibiotic-associated vs. 
medication-associated (ritonavir and atazanavir a/w diarrhea) 
vs. HIV-assicated diarrhea. Work-up included egative C. diff, 
stool culture, O&P, cyclospora, isospora, cryptosporidium and 
Giardia. This was improving, per patient, on discharge, and he 
no longer had major electrolyte disturbances.

# Acute urinary retention: Patient stated that urinary retention 
has been an issue for him during previuos hospitalizations. Per 
record review, it appears that the patient has been on both 
tamsulosin and finasteride as an outpatient for "likely" BPH. 
While inaptient, he continued to fail voiding trials, and was 
requiring CIC, so foley was placed ___. Has a history of taking 
tamsulosin ___ the past, but this is contraindicated with 
ritonavir, so this was not restarted. He was discharged with a 
foley ___ place, but with plan for voiding trial and urology 
follow-up as outpatient.

# HIV: His most recent CD4 count was 131 on ___ at ___ 
___. HIV-1 RNA was 55 copies/mL at that time as 
well. Pt reports general adherence with medications but he does 
report stopping them for a while a few months back. Given his 
inconsistency with medications, he may need HIV genotyping due 
to risk of developing resistance. His home regimen (atazanavir, 
ritonavir, raltegravir, and emtricitabine-tenofovir) was 
continued ___, and he was told to follow-up with his 
outpatient HIV primary care physician. He was also restarted on 
PCP prophylaxis with bactrim on discharge.

# Nutrition: Patient very cachectic on exam. He reported issues 
___ the past with weight loss and reports recent 10lb 
unintentional weight loss over this month. Nutrition was 
consulted who recommended multivitamin and nutritional 
supplement TID. His weight was monitored as well. 

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: 
# Nuntrition: could discuss PPN/TPN as outpatient when infection 
resolved versus appetite promoting agent (e.g. megace)
# Pulmonary: will need CT ___ follow-up (3 weeks from discharge) 
to re-eval cavitary area for resolution and to rule out 
malignancy
# GU: voiding trial for urinary retention as an outpatient
# CODE STATUS: full code confirmed  
# CONTACT: ___ (friend) ___

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,

It was a pleasure taking care of you during your hospitalization 
at ___. You were admitted from ___ due to fevers 
and a cough over the past several weeks, and found to have a 
pneumonia caused by a bacteria caused by a bacteria called Staph 
aureus. This infection was very severe and spread to your blood. 
For this reason, you will need long term antibiotics.

You were seen by our Infectious Disease specialists, who 
recommended receiving at least 4 weeks of nafcillin. 

You need to have a follow-up CT scan of your chest to assess for 
resolution of your pneumonia. We strongly suggest that you have 
this done on the day of your follow-up appointment with Dr. 
___. (If you are absolutely unable to do this, you can have 
it done locally, but then you must bring the report and the 
images to your ___ appointment.)

___ terms of your HIV regimen, it is very important that you take 
your medications every day. We are also starting you on a new 
medication, called Bactrim, which will help prevent some 
infections for which you are at risk. Please follow-up with your 
outpatient physicians as below.

We wish you the best!
-Your ___ Team
