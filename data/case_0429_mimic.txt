Brief Hospital Course:
___ G1P0 admitted at 24+2 weeks gestation with short cervix.
.
Ms ___ initially had some irregular contractions on toco 
which resolved with hydration. Her cervix, however, was found to 
be 1cm dilated and 90% effaced. Fetal testing was reassuring. 
Due to her high risk for a preterm delivery, she was admitted 
for hospitalized bedrest, close observation, and betamethasone 
for fetal lung maturity. She was contined on the vaginal 
progesterone weekly. ___ was consulted and agreed with 
hospitalized bedrest until 28 weeks gestation. She started 
contracting irregularly at 25 weeks and she was started on 
Nifedipine for tocolysis. Her cervix was unchanged at that time. 
On toco, she had frequent periods of irritability with 
occasional contractions (typically ___ contractions/30min). At 
28 weeks gestation, her cervix was dilated to 2.5cm dilated and 
at 30 weeks gestation she was 3cm/100%. The progesterone was 
discontinued at that time. She remained hospitalized until 34 
weeks when her cervix stabilized at 3cm. She was discharged home 
at that time. The Nifedipine was discontinued. She will continue 
modified bedrest at home with close followup.
.
In regards to fetal well-being, her fetal testing was reassuring 
throughout this admission. She was monitored with daily NSTs, 
weekly, biophysical profiles, and growth scans every three 
weeks. She was betamethasone complete on ___. The NICU was 
consulted. On the day of discharge, ultrasound revealed a vertex 
fetus, BPP ___, AFI 16.8, and ___ 24998g(57%).
.
She had no complications during her hospitalization. She was 
followed by social services to help her cope with this lengthy 
hospitalization. Physical therapy was consulted to provide 
stretching/exercises while on prolonged bedrest. She had a 
normal GLT prior to administration of betamethasone.
