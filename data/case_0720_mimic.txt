Brief Hospital Course:
The patient with h/o GE junction cancer s/p neoadjuvant therapy 
was admitted to the Surgical Oncology Service for elective 
surgical resection. On ___, the patient underwent 
exploratory laparoscopy, D2 total esophagogastrectomy, left 
thoracotomy and intrathoracic Roux-en-Y esophagojejunostomy, 
which went well without complication (please see the Operative 
Note for details). Post operative patient was extubated and 
transferred in ICU for pressure support. On POD 1, patient's 
epidural was turned down, she was transitioned to ___, her BP 
improved and phenylephrine was weaned off. Patient was 
transferred to the floor NPO with NGT, on IV fluids, chest tube 
to H2O, Foley catheter and dPCA with IV Methadone for pain 
control. The patient was hemodynamically stable.
Neuro: The patient received epidural analgesia immediately post 
op, epidural was turned off secondary to hypotension, and 
patient was started on dPCA. Patient has a history of chronic 
pain and her pain was not well controlled with PCA only. IV 
Methadone was added into pain regiment. On POD 3 patient 
underwent rectus sheath block. After tube feeding started 
patient was transitioned to liquid Oxycodone, Methadone was 
weaned off and rectus sheath catheters were discontinued. 
CV: The patient remained stable from a cardiovascular 
standpoint; post operative ECG demonstrated normal sinus rhythm.
Pulmonary: Post operative patient had left chest tube to H2O. 
She had moderate output from CT. Her post op CXR revealed 
pulmonary edema and effusions. She required small amount of 
supplemental O2 post operative to maintain O2sat > 90%. On POD 
7, chest tube was removed, post removal CXR was negative for 
pneumothorax. On following day patient was weaned off 
supplemental O2 and remained on room air since. 
GI: Post-operatively, the patient was made NPO with NGT. She was 
started on trophic tube feed on POD 2. Her tube feed was 
advanced to goal on POD 4. Patient underwent upper GI study on 
POD 6, which was negative for leak and NGT was discontinued. 
Patient's diet was advanced to fulls and her tube feeds started 
to cycle. Patient tolerated small amount of full liquid diet, 
most of her medications were given via J-tube. On POD 8, patient 
was found distended and KUB was obtained. KUB demonstrated non 
obstructive gas pattern. Nutritional service was consulted, and 
patient tube feeding formula was changed to without fiber and 
was infused continuously. Patient had diarrhea and stool was 
sent for C. diff. C. diff PCR was positive and patient was 
started on Vancomycin PO. On POD 10, C. diff toxin came back 
negative and Vancomycin was discontinued. Patient was started on 
banana flakes to help bulking her stool and diarrhea subsided. 
GE: After Foley was discontinued on POD 3, patient was voiding 
without difficulties. 
ID: The patient's white blood count and fever curves were 
closely watched for signs of infection. Wound was evaluated 
daily and no signs or symptoms of infection were noticed. 
Endocrine: The patient's blood sugar was monitored throughout 
his stay and remained within normal limits. 
Hematology: The patient's complete blood count was examined 
routinely; no transfusions were required.
Prophylaxis: The patient received subcutaneous heparin and 
venodyne boots were used during this stay; she was transitioned 
to prophylactic Lovenox prior to discharge for 30 days total. 
At the time of discharge, the patient was doing well, afebrile 
with stable vital signs.  The patient was tolerating tube feed 
at goal and full liquid, ambulating with rolling walker, voiding 
without assistance, and pain was well controlled.  The patient 
received discharge teaching and follow-up instructions with 
understanding verbalized and agreement with the discharge plan.
