History of Present Illness:
HPI: The pt is an ___ year-old right handed woman with a past 
medical history significant for HTN, CHF, Afib (not on 
coumadin), and breast cancer who presents approximately 2 weeks

.
OSH CT - R temporal small hemorrhage with surrounding edema, 
grey-white junction intact. 
.
MRI Head:
FINDINGS: On T1-weighted sequences, there is high T1 signal 
within the cortex of the right temporal lobe likely consitent 
with hemorrhagic changes.  Following administration of 
intravenous gadolinium, there is further enhancement of the 
right temporal cortex as well as a small area in the cortex of 
the right insula. This likely represents pseudolaminar necorosis 
and reperfusion phenomena along with cortical hemorrhage in the 
setting of a subacute infarction in the territory of the right 
MCA. On gradient echo sequences, there is low susceptibility 
seen within the right temporal lobe consistent with old blood 
products. There is no discrete mass seen within the right 
temporal lobe. There is no mass effect. There is no shift of 
midline. There is moderate restricted diffusion seen within the 
right temporal lobe consistent with a subacute infarction. There 
are no other areas of restricted diffusion seen. 
.  
On FLAIR sequences, there is high periventricular and 
subcortical signal consistent with small vessel ischemic 
disease. There are normal arterial flow voids seen. There is no 
thickening of the mucosal sinuses. 
. 
IMPRESSION: 
1. Within the right temporal and right insular lobes there is 
cortical hemorrhagic changes and possible pseudolaminar necrosis 
consistent with a subacute area of infarction in the territory 
of the right MCA. 
2. There are no masses seen and there is no mass effect or 
midline shift. 
3. There are no areas of acute infarction seen. 
.
CT Chest, Abd, and Pelvis (prelim read): No evidence of new 
malignancy or recurrent malignancy
.
CT T spine (prelim read): There is a compression fracture of the 
T9 vertebral body with approximately 10% loss of height. This 
fracture appears to be acute; however, MRI could be used to 
better evaluate. There are bilateral pleural effusions, right 
greater  than the left 
.EEG:
BACKGROUND: A 9 Hz predominant posterior rhythm was seen, which 
attenuated with eye opening. Occasional independent bitemporal 
slower 
activity in the theta range was seen. 
HYPERVENTILATION: Could not be performed. 
INTERMITTENT PHOTIC STIMULATION: Produced no activation of the 
record. 
SLEEP: The patient progressed frm wake to drowsy sate, but did 
not 
attaine stage II sleep. 
CARDIAC MONITOR: A reneraly regular rhythm with an average rate 
of 90 
bpm and occasional irregularity was seen. 
IMPRESSION: This is a normal for age routine EEG in the awake 
and drowsy 
states. There were no lateralized or epileptiform features 
noted. Of 
note is the occasionally irregular ECG. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
Neurology:
Pt. was admitted to the General Neurology service.  MRI Head was 
performed (see read above) and showed evidence of a subacute to 
chronic infarct with some hemorrhagic transformation.  This was 
felt to be the etiology of the hemorrhage seen on the initial 
Head CT.  On exam she was at times agitated and paranoid, which 
was felt to be a residual from her infarct.  Neurologic exam was 
otherwise normal (though limited by cooperation), with intact 
strength and sensation.  Given the location of her infarct she 
would be at risk to have a right superior quadrantanopsia, but 
this could not be tested given her cooperation.  Unfortunately 
not all series on the MRI could be performed because pt. became 
agitated, so no MRA of the head or neck were not done.  The team 
attempted to encourage her several times to have the MRA of the 
head performed but pt. refused.  Pt. was monitored on telemetry 
and was in A fib throughout her stay.  Her rate was in the ___ 
to 100s on her home dose of digoxin.  Atrial fibrillation with 
cardiac emboli was felt to be the most likely etiology of her 
stroke, though artery to artery embolus from the carotid could 
be be entirely ruled out without MRA.  She was continued on her 
home aspirin regimen.  Anti-coagulation with Coumadin was not 
started acutely given the hemorrhage seen on CT and MRI, but 
should be considered as the hemorrhage resolves given her risk 
for further cardioembolic strokes.
.
Pt. had a history of breast cancer, s/p mastectomy, BRCA +.  
There was initially some concern that the hemorrhage could have 
been due to an underlying mass lesion (though ultimately MRI was 
more consistent with subacute infarct)  CT of the torso was 
therefore performed (without contrast given contrast allergy) 
and showed no evidence of mass lesion or metastasis per prelim 
read.
.
An EEG was performed to rule out subclinical seizures 
contributing to her confusion and agitation.  This was normal, 
with no epileptiform discharges.
.
A CT of the thoracic spine showed an acute compression fracture, 
with 10% loss of disc height.  She had no back pain, so this not 
intervened on.
.
We recommended that she have an MRA or CTA of her head and neck 
and a TTE to complete her stroke work up.  She requested 
transfer to ___ to complete this work up, so this was arranged.
.
Cardiology: In A fib throughout her stay, continued on home dose 
of digoxin.  One set of cardiac enzymes negative, no chest pain 
in house.
.
Respiratory:  Given high d-dimer and recent complaints of 
dyspnea there was initially some concern for PE in ED.  Patient 
refused VQ scan, and could not get a CTA due to a contrast dye 
allergy.  Her respiratory status was stable on the floor, with 
no shortness of breath or hypoxia to suggest PE.

Discharge Condition:
Stable

 
Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted to the hospital after you had a fall at home.  
You were found on Head CT to have some bleeding in the right 
side of your brain.  An MRI of your head showed a stroke, which 
is likely the cause of the bleeding.

We would like to do some more tests to see why you had the 
stroke.  You have requested transfer to ___ to 
have these performed there, which we will arrange.  It will be 
important to have these tests completed so we can minimize your 
risk of having further strokes.
 
Followup Instructions:
___
