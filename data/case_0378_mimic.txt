MICROBIOLOGY

RELEVANT STUDIES
======================
___ RUQ U/S: 
1. No signs acute cholecystitis. 
2. Echogenic liver consistent with steatosis. Other forms of 
liver disease 
including steatohepatitis, hepatic fibrosis, or cirrhosis cannot 
be excluded on the basis of this examination. 
3. Mild splenomegaly. 
4. Small bilateral pleural effusions.

___ CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST:
1. No evidence of an acute intracranial abnormality. 
2. Small air-fluid level in the sphenoid sinus raising the 
possibility of 
developing sinusitis.

ESR: ___ year old male with no significant past medical history
presents to the ICU as a transfer from OSH with acute 
respiratory
failure secondary to influenza complicated by ARDS, and new R
knee effusion likely inflammatory

#Acute Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure; ARDS
#Flu A positive 
Positive flu swab at OSH with fevers, respiratory symptoms and
bilateral hazy opacities on CXR and flu A positive. P/F ratio 
150
at lowest consistent with ARDS requiring paralysis and lung
protective ventilation strategy. Patient self extubated on ___
as been stable on NC since that time, currently 4L. On Tamiflu
with low suspicion for superimposed bacterial process at this
time. Patient without significant volume overload on exam but 
has
been receiving diuresis in ICU given pulmonary edema (due to
capillary leak in setting of ARDS). Currently off o2, doing very 
well, no need for diuresis.

- continue oseltamivir 75mg BID (day 1 = ___ to complete 7d
- defer antibiotics at this time 

#Right knee effusion
Pain with ambulation and moderate effusion of right knee. No
prior trauma. Effusion is tapped, no crystals, 4k wbc very
unlikely to be septic. Uric acid only in the 5s so unlikely gout
flair. Lyme vs GC comes to mind. Lyme titers sent, will get
GC/chlam tesing, cultures pending. ESR/CRP high, may be hinting 
at inflammatory arthritis.
Knee pain improved after tap. Patient freely ambulatory. Would 
defer further workup to outpatient.
- continue ibuprofen q8h prn
- trial ice pack/hot packs
- ___ culture pending

CHRONIC ISSUES
=============
#Elevated Transaminases - resolved
Low suspicion for shock liver as he has been largely 
normotensive
despite transient pressor requirement. Suspect due to viral
illness. 
-trend LFT's until improving
