Mr. ___ was admitted to Dr. ___ as noted in the HPI for 
hematuria after transurethral resection of his bladder mass. He 
is status post angioplasty ___ requiring ongoing Plavix and 
Aspirin administration. He presented to ED with hematuria less 
than 24hrs status post cystoscopy, TURBT, bladder fulgeration 
and a 3-way foley was placed and continuous bladder irrigation 
initiated. He was transferred to the general surgical floor 
where he was again hand irrigated with 7-litres of sterile water 
for multiple clots by ___. His urine output was 
monitored with continuous bladder irrigation, titrated to light 
pink. He was made NPO after midnight on date of admission 
pending further recommendations from patients cardiologist 
and/or Dr. ___. Intravenous antibiotics was started given the 
multiple manipulations and hand irrigations. His hospital course 
was complicated by the requirement of several hand irrigations 
for clots but by hospital day three, ultrasound of the bladder 
was obtained and demonstrated a large retained clot. He was then 
hand irrigated to clear by Chief Resident ___ and ___. 
CBI was continued overnight and titrated to off by hospital day

ambulated with the CBI off and his hematuria did not reoccur. He 
remained a-febrile throughout his hospital stay and at 
discharge, the patient had pain well controlled with oral pain 
medications, was tolerating regular diet, ambulating without 
assistance, and versed on foley care and waste elimination. He 
was given Pyridium and oral pain medications on

for clots.

-Do not lift anything heavier than a phone book (10 pounds) or 
drive until you are seen by your Urologist in follow-up. Do NOT

voiding. This medication may turn your urine bright orange.

-Colace has been prescribed to avoid post surgical constipation 
and constipation related to narcotic pain medication. 
Discontinue if loose stool or diarrhea develops. Colace is a 
stool softener, NOT a laxative, and available over the counter. 
The generic name is DOCUSATE SODIUM. It is recommended that you 
use this medication.

Tylenol

-Do not drive or drink alcohol while taking narcotics and do not 
operate dangerous machinery. Also, if the Foley catheter and Leg 
Bag are in place--Do NOT drive (you may be a passenger).

IF YOU ARE DISCHARGED HOME WITH A FOLEY CATHETER:
-Please refer to the provided nursing instructions and handout 
on Foley catheter care, waste elimination and leg bag usage.

-Your Foley should be secured to the catheter secure on your 
thigh at ALL times until your follow up with the surgeon.

-Follow up in 1 week for wound check and Foley removal. DO NOT 
have anyone else other than your Surgeon remove your Foley for

aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve 
appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. 
There is no pericardial effusion. Normal coronary sinus. No clot 
observed in the ___. Intact interatrial septum. Mild diffuse 
desc thoracic aortic atherosclerosis. Diastolic dysfunction 
consistent with impaired relaxation.

POSTBYPASS:
Improved LV systolic function, otherwise unchanged. No new wall 
motion abnormalities after chest closure. No dissection seen 
after removal of the aortic cannula. 
All findings discussed with the surgical team.   
.
TTE ___
Conclusions  
The left atrium is elongated. The right atrium is moderately 
dilated. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy 
with normal cavity size. There is mild regional left ventricular 
systolic dysfunction with hypokinesis of the mid to distal 
anterior septum, distal anterior wall, apical lateral wall, and 
apex proper. The remaining segments contract normally (LVEF = 
45%). There is no ventricular septal defect. The aortic valve 
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not 
present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve 
appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. 
There is no mitral valve prolapse. There is mild pulmonary 
artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion 
(a fat pad is present).

IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with 
normal cavity size and mild regional systolic dysfunction c/w 
CAD (mid-LAD distribution). Mild pulmonary hypertension.   
.
PA/LAT CXR ___:
IMPRESSION: No previous images.  The heart is at the upper 
limits of normal in size and there is no evidence of vascular 
congestion, pleural effusion, or acute focal pneumonia.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ was admitted following his cardiac cath which 
revealed multivessel disease, including in stent restenosis of 
the LAD stent placed in ___. Upon admission, he was medically 
managed and underwent the appropriate pre-operative work-up. On 
___, he was brought to the operating room where he underwent 
a coronary artery bypass graft x 4. Please see operative note 
for surgical details. Following surgery he was transferred to 
the CVICU for invasive monitoring in stable condition. Later 
this day he was weaned from sedation, awoke neurologically 
intact and extubated.
POD 1 found the patient extubated, alert and oriented and 
breathing comfortably.  The patient was neurologically intact 
and hemodynamically stable, weaned from inotropic and 
vasopressor support. Beta blocker was initiated and the patient 
was gently diuresed toward the preoperative weight.  The patient 
was transferred to the telemetry floor for further recovery. 
Beta blockers were increased for tachycardia. Chest tubes and 
pacing wires were discontinued without complication. The patient 
was evaluated by the physical therapy service for assistance 
with strength and mobility. Low dose Lisinopril was added for EF 
35-45% at the time of discharge and is to be titrated by 
outpatient cardiologist, as well as close renal function 
monitoring with initiation of ACE-I. By the time of discharge on 
POD 4 the patient was ambulating freely, the wound was healing 
and pain was controlled with oral analgesics.  The patient was 
discharged home with visiting nurse services in good condition 
with appropriate follow up instructions.
