___ 10:50AM BLOOD Calcium-9.4 Phos-3.4 Mg-1.___ woman with Alzheimer's disease who presents with 
unintential overdose of her memantine, donepezil, and atenolol. 

ACUTE/ACTIVE PROBLEMS:
# Unintentional overdose of memantine, donepezil, and atenolol: 
patient had bradycardia to low ___.  She had some agitation 
which could signify some cholinergic toxicity.  Atenolol 
half-life was ___ hours in normal renal function.  Memantine and 
donepezil have longer half-lives of 60-70 hours.  All 
medications can influence heart
rate and cardiac conduction.  Patient was monitored on telemetry 
with no cardiac conduction abnormalities.  QTc was high normal.  
Atenolol was stopped due to risk of bradycardia if patient 
develops renal failure.  Donepezil and memantine will be 
restarted on discharge.  Care should be taken to prevent taking 
multiple doses of medications going forward.

# Hypertension: atenolol was stopped as noted above.  Amlodipine 
5 mg PO daily was started in its place with controlled blood 
pressure on discharge.

# Elevated lactic acid: likely from medication overdose, 
improved soon after admission.

# Alzheimer's dementia: ramelteon QHS given during admission.

TRANSITIONS OF CARE
-------------------
# Follow-up: patient's blood pressure should be monitored on new 
dose of amlodipine.  Medications may need to be further 
titrated.  Care should be taken to prevent patient taking

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,

It was a pleasure caring for you during your recent 
hospitalization.  You came to the hospital after taking too much 
of your medications.  Further testing showed that your heart 
rate was slowed by this, but did not continue to worsen over 
time.  By now, most of the medications should be out of your 
system.  You are now being discharged.

You will not continue on atenolol any longer.  Amlodipine is 
being given instead to control your blood pressure.

It is important that you continue to take your medications as 
prescribed and follow up with the appointments listed below.

Good luck!
