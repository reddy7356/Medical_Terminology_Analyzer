Attending: ___
 
Chief Complaint:
Weakness

 
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

 
History of Present Illness:
 ___ year old with a h/o lupus anticoagulant with L MCA
infarct and myotonic dystropy who presents with headache and
worsened left sided weakness.  She states that for the past 4
days, she has felt strange.  She has a right sided headache that
is sharp, makes her feel nauseated, and is associated with
photophobia.  She normally takes Fiorcet and hasn't experienced
much relief this time.  The headache feels better lying down,
there is no change in Valsalva.  She has had headaches before
that are similar in character but usually improve with the
Fiorcet.  She also complains of some blurry (foggy) vision.  She
also says that she has had some occasional numbness of her left
face.

She was then brought to ___ for evaluation of these
complaints.  At ___, ___ was 104.  Labs were unremarkable. 

Head CT was sent here but no interpretation accompanied the
paperwork.  She was then transferred to ___ for further
evaluation.  At arrival here, her symptoms are unchanged.  A
repeat head CT was done, which is unchanged.

Her husband states that her weakness has been a progressive
decline.  When they bought the house in ___, she was able to go
up and down the stairs alternating feet without problems.  She
now has to go up the stairs sideways.  He doesn’t feel that she
has been particularly weak over the past few days. She also has
not complained to him of any symptoms of headaches, blurry
vision, or numbness.

There is a neurology note from ___.  In ___, she had an
angiogram, which showed stenosis of the left ophthalmic artery 
at
the origin with severe stenosis and occlusion of the left
vertebral artery.  There was diffuse atheromatous disease and
moderate to severe stenosis of the left MCA.  The stenosis 
begins
at the proximal portion of the vessel and extends approximately
2cm.  They were going to follow wiht Q3-6 month MRAs.  At that
time her total cholesterol was 150 and LDL 96. She was started 
on
Aggrenox.   She also has a MRI from this past ___ where it
states that the chief complaint for the study is headache and
blurry vision.

CT head:
IMPRESSION:
1. No intracranial hemorrhage or evidence of acute major 
vascular territorial infarction. Vague hypodensity in the right 
periatrial region is more likely due to chronic microvascular 
infarction or subacute infarct. Please note that MR with 
diffusion- weighted imaging is more sensitive for evaluation of 
acute infarction.
2. Remote left MCA territorial infarction.

ER dashboard wet read placed at 8 p.m., ___.

FINDINGS: BRAIN MRI:

There is a chronic left middle cerebral artery territorial 
infarct identified. A chronic infarct is also seen in the left 
posterior temporal lobe extending to the occipital lobe 
indicating a partial left posterior cerebral artery territory 
infarct. There is no evidence of slow diffusion to indicate 
acute infarct. There is mild-to-moderate brain atrophy. Mild 
changes of small vessel disease are seen. Increased signal 
anteriorly in both temporal lobes could be secondary to previous 
trauma or small vessel disease. There is no evidence of acute or 
chronic blood products identified or mass effect seen or 
hydrocephalus identified.

IMPRESSION: No evidence of acute infarct. Chronic left MCA and 
partial PCA infarct. Mild changes of small vessel disease and 
brain atrophy.

MRA OF THE NECK:

The neck MRA demonstrates normal flow signal in both carotids 
and right vertebral artery. The left vertebral artery flow 
signal is not identified indicating occlusion at the origin.

IMPRESSION: Non-visualization of the left vertebral artery 
consistent with occlusion. No other abnormalities on MRA of the 
neck.

MRA OF THE HEAD:

The head MRA demonstrates diminished flow signal and 
irregularity of the flow signal in the left middle cerebral 
artery which could be secondary to the chronic infarct seen in 
the left MCA territory. The irregularity of the flow signal 
indicates intrinsic disease within the middle cerebral artery. 
The remaining arteries of the anterior and posterior circulation 
are normal in appearance with non-visualization of the left 
vertebral artery.

IMPRESSION: Flow signal irregularity indicating intrinsic 
disease in the left MCA with diminished flow signal could be 
secondary to the chronic infarct seen in the MCA. 
Non-visualization of the left vertebral artery due to occlusion 
in the neck.

___. ___
___. ___

 
Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the neurology service (stroke 
service) for possible new stroke causing left-sided weakness.  
MRI of the brain revealed no new infarct, and the MRA of the 
brain showed no new areas of stenosis to suggest a CNS etiology 
for her weakness.  Her weakness, on re-examination, was largely 
distal and bilateral, with some giveway at both the biceps and 
triceps and no weakness at the deltoid.  This pattern was not 
felt to be consistent with stroke.  Overall, her symptoms were 
felt to be most consistent with gradual worsening of her 
myotonic dystrophy.  Her lipids were checked and were pending at 
discharge. She had an echo recently as an outpatient. All other 
outpatient medications were continued.  A1c was pending at 
discharge as well.  Her headaches were treated with Fioricet.  
Her husband confirmed that her strength, walking, speech and 
remainder of neuro findings were indeed at baseline, and she was 
discharged.  Of note, her INR was therapeutic at admission (2.0 
at OSH) but was 1.6 at ___.  Her coumadin dose was increased 
slightly to 5mg/day and she was given instructions to have her 
INR checked two days from discharge (___).  She was also given 
a prescription for physical therapy, which may help her walking. 
 She should follow up with her neuromuscular specialist, Dr. 
___, at ___. Her LDL should be maintained less than 70 and 
HbA1c less than 7 given the vessel stenosis seen.
