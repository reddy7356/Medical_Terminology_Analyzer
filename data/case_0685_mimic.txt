___ - cardiac catheterization
 
History of Present Illness:
___ w/ PMHx of bladder cancer and gallbladder cancer status post
urostomy, HFrEF (EF ___, T2DM presenting with
increasing shortness of breath and decreased urine output. Of
note the patient was recently referred to the ___ after
presenting to clinic for an appointment w/ his gerentologist and
complaining of a couple of weeks of worsening dyspnea on
exertion. He was seen in the CDAC by Dr. ___. While there he
had a TTE showing a decreased EF of ___ from prior and
worsened mitral regurgitation. He also had a VQ scan due to an
elevated D-Dimer which was read as low likelihood for recent PE.
He was discharged with plans to follow up with Dr. ___ in
clinic in early ___ and to have a nuclear stress test done
to evaluate for ischemic disease.

Since his discharge a few days ago, the patient reports
persistent dyspnea on exertion and was concerned by low UOP. He
has an ostomy bag as a result of his history of bladder cancer
and says he usually has anywhere from 800cc-1.5L of output daily
but for the last couple of days has had only about 100cc each
day. He denied any recent CP, palpitations, worsening ___ edema,
weight gain, orthopnea, or PND.

Brief Hospital Course:
P - Patient summary statement for admission
==================================
___ w/ PMHx of bladder cancer and gallbladder cancer status post 
urostomy, HFrEF (EF ___, T2DM presenting with 
increasing shortness of breath and decreased urine output.

A - Acute medical/surgical issues addressed
==================================
#Acute on chronic systolic heart failure
#Dyspnea on exertion 
Patient presented with worsening dyspnea most likely secondary 
to acute on chronic systolic heart failure. He was seen in the 
CDAC two days prior to admission during which he had TTE showing 
reduced EF w/ regional WMA. Admission chest x ray demonstrated 
interval worsening in pulmonary and he has cool extremities. 
Patient reported good dietary and medication adherence. No 
ongoing chest pain, EKG unchanged, and cardiac enzymes only 
mildly elevated. Left heart catheterization was without 
significantly worsening ischemia. Patient had significant 
ventricular ectopy on telemetry. Therefore, it is possible that 
worsening systolic function is secondary to frequent PVCs. 
Cardiac MRI was performed but the result was pending at the time 
of discharge. He was seen by electrophysiology and started on 
amiodarone. For management, he was diuresed with IV Lasix and 
transitioned to PO torsemide. For afterload, patient was started 
on hydralazine and isordil, lisinopril was held in setting of 
___ as below. For NHBK, beta blocker initially held given cool 
extremities and concern for cardiogenic shock, but was restarted 
at a lower dose given frequent ectopy and improvement in 
perfusion.

#Ventricular ectopy
Patient had significant ventricular ectopy on telemetry, 
including up to 10 beat runs of VT. Patient was hemodynamically 
stable and asymptomatic throughout hospitalization. As above, it 
is possible that PVC burden is contributing to worsening 
cardiomyopathy. Patient was started on amiodarone per EP 
recommendations.

#Decreasing urine output
#Acute on chronic kidney disease
Patient presented from home w/ decreased UOP over the last few 
days after recently starting PO Lasix. Likely pre-renal from 
heart failure exacerbation. Cr on admission was 1.9. Creatinine 
briefly improved to 1.4, but increased again likely complicated 
by contrast-induced nephropathy after coronary angiography. Cr 
on discharge was 2.0. Home lisinopril was held on discharge 
given ___.

#Borderline UA: Patient w/ altered anatomy due to history of 
cancer and ostomy in place. No systemic signs or symptoms of 
infection. Urine culture showed pan-sensitive E coli. Given that 
patient was asymptomatic, decision was made to defer 
antibiotics.

#RLE rash
Patient had nonconfluent punctate rash on his RLE, not 
consistent with cellulitis. U/S negative for DVT. Potentially 
contact dermatitis, as rash is near sock line. Rash improved 
without intervention.

C - Chronic issues pertinent to admission
==================================
#Hx of Carotid Stenosis, s/p R carotid endarterectomy
Increased atorvastatin dose

#HLD:
Increased atorvastatin

#HTN:
As above, patient was started on hydralazine and isordil for BP 
management. Lisinopril was held on discharge in the setting of 
___.

#T2DM:
Managed with insulin sliding scale while inpatient

#Bladder cancer status post prostatectomy with urostomy
Stable. Followed by outpatient urology

T - Transitional Issues
==================================
[ ] Patient was started on amiodarone 400mg daily for 
ventricular ectopy with a plan for a 1 week load. His dose will 
be decreased to 200mg daily beginning on ___.

[ ] Cardiac MRI was performed with results still pending at 
discharge.

[ ] Lisinopril was held on discharge given ___. Patient should 
have repeat Chem7 on ___ with his PCP. Pending improvement in 
renal function, the decision can be made to restart Lisinopril.

[ ] Patient was discharged on a new home diuretic dose. He 
should have repeat Chem7 and weight on ___ with his PCP. 
Diuretic dose can be adjusted as needed pending renal function 
and weight.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr ___,

It was a pleasure caring for you at ___.  

WHY WAS I IN THE HOSPITAL?  
==========================  
-You were admitted to the hospital because you were feeling 
short of breath. 

WHAT HAPPENED IN THE HOSPITAL?  
==============================  
-You were admitted to the hospital because you had been feeling 
short of breath and you were found to have fluid on your lungs. 
This was felt to be due to a condition called heart failure, 
where your heart does not pump hard enough and fluid backs up 
into your lungs. You were given a diuretic medication through 
the IV to help get the fluid out.
-An ultrasound of your heart (echocardiogram) showed that the 
pumping function of your heart had decreased.
-You had a cardiac catheterization that showed the blood vessels 
of your heart are not significantly blocked.
-You had an MRI to look at the structure of your heart.
-You were started on new medications called hydralazine and 
isosorbide mononitrate to help control your blood pressure.
-The heart monitor showed that you had a lot of extra premature 
beats. You were started on a new medication called amiodarone to 
help control the extra beats.

WHAT SHOULD I DO WHEN I GO HOME?  
================================  
-Please take your medications as listed in discharge summary and 
follow up at the listed appointments. 
- Your weight at discharge is 220 pounds. Please weigh yourself 
today at home and use this as your new baseline.
-Weigh yourself every morning, call your primary doctor or your 
cardiologist if your weight goes up more than 3 lbs in one day 
or 5lbs in one week.

Thank you for allowing us to be involved in your care, we wish 
you all the best!

Brief Hospital Course:
___ man with history of CAD, CKD (baseline Cr 1.2-1.3), bladder 
cancer s/p ileal conduit/urostomy, gallbladder carcinoma s/p 
cholecystectomy and partial hepatectomy, recurrent E. coli UTIs 
who presented s/p fall with weakness, altered mental status and 
cough. He reported having a mild nonproductive cough for about 2 
weeks. 2 days PTA he developed profound weakness and was unable 
to get up from sitting. He attempted to stand from the floor to 
get into bed and due to weakness fell and hit his head. family 
reported he appeared mildly confused on the phone. CT head and 
CT neck were negative for acute injury. He tested positive for 
influenza A and was started on tamiflu. UCx contaminated. He was 
initially also started on broad spectrum antibiotics for UTI but 
these were held after UCx returned. His mental status returned 
to baseline quickly and he regained his strength and was able to 
walk around without difficulty. He was discharged home on 
tamiflu course. Of note, he was noted on telemetry to have PVCs 
and frequent nonsustained VT, which had been noted in setting of 
infection on prior admissions. These were well-controlled by 
uptitrating his metoprolol to BID from TID during this 
admission. He as discharged on home dose of metoprolol. 

By problem: 
 
# Weakness: 
Likely in the setting of infection, as the patient tested 
positive for influenza A. CXR without clear suggestion of 
pneumonia, UA dirty but UCx suggestive of contamination rather 
than UTI. He was intiially started on broad spectrum antibiotics 
but these were discontinued after negative cultures. CAP 
coverage also started initially but discontinued. acute coronary 
syndrome was ruled out and BNP elevated but lower than previous, 
and he was clinically euvolemic. 

# Influenza A: Tamiflu 30mg q12h x5d (___) 

# HFrEF: EF 40% in ___. Likely ischemic. BNP elevated at 2275 
(prior in ___ of 4288), patient was dlinically euvolemic. He 
was continued on his home lisinopril. His home metoprolol was 
uptitrated from BID to TID dosing in the setting of nonsustained 
VT (see below). 

#AMS
#Fall
Patient felt weak at home and attempted to stand up from the 
floor, felt weak and was unable to get into bed. He rolled to 
the floor and hit his head. he denies losing consciousness. His 
family noted he had been confused that day, and he was noted to 
be confused in the ED. By the time he was admitted to the floor 
his mental status had dramatically improved and he was alert and 
oriented x3, and able to recount the full incident and perform 
serial 7s. His AMS was likely in setting of infection. His CT 
Head and Neck were negative for acute injury or bleed. 

# ___ on CKD: mild ___ in likely in setting of poor PO intake 
and infection. resolved. 

# Ectopy: patient has a history of ventricular ectopy and

Imaging
___ Chest Xray
IMPRESSION: Bibasilar interstitial reticular opacities, right 
greater than 
left, concerning for infectious processes such as pneumonia. 
Radiographic 
followup in six to eight weeks following appropriate treatment 
is suggested to document resolution. 
.
___
IMPRESSION: 
1. 4.1 cm fluid collection within the gallbladder fossa which 
drapes around the lateral aspect of the liver without evidence 
of rim enhancement or gas. Differential diagnosis includes 
postoperative hematoma, seroma or contained bile leak. Despite 
the fact that this collection does not rim enhance, infection 
cannot be excluded as the patient presents with a history of 
MRSA bacteriemia of unknown etiology. This collection would be 
amenable to percutaneous sampling. 
2. Small bowel herniation into ileostomy site without evidence 
of 
obstruction. 
3. Indeterminate right adrenal nodule stable since ___. 
.
___ Ultrasound Guided Drainage of Gallbladder Fossa
IMPRESSION: Successful ultrasound-guided drainage of fluid 
collection within the gallbladder fossa. Fluid sent to 
microbiology for further analysis. 
.
___ ECHO
The left atrium is mildly dilated. No atrial septal defect is 
seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is mild symmetric left 
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size. There is mild 
regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with moderate to 
severe hypokinesis of the inferior and inferolateral segments. 
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular 
filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size 
and free wall motion are normal. The diameters of aorta at the 
sinus, ascending and arch levels are normal. The aortic valve 
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not 
present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve 
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve 
prolapse. No masses or vegetations are seen on the mitral valve, 
but cannot be fully excluded due to suboptimal image quality. 
Mild to moderate (___) mitral regurgitation is seen. The 
estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There is 
a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion. 
IMPRESSION: No endocarditis, abscess or significant valvular 
regurgitation seen. Mild regional LV systolic dysfunction with 
moderate to severe inferior and inferolateral hypokinesis. 
Diastolic dysfunction. Mild to moderate mitral regurgitation.
If clinically suggested, the absence of a vegetation by 2D 
echocardiography does not exclude endocarditis. 
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of ___, the 
function of the inferior and inferolateral walls is slightly 
improved and there is consequently less mitral regurgitation.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ ___ year old man with a past medical history 
significant for CAD, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, previous 
bladder cancer and recent gallbladder CA. He is s/p liver 
resection and cholecystectomy in ___. Due for gemcitabine 
on day of admission, which was held due to new symptoms. He was 
admitted from clinic with a leukocytosis and found to have a 
bacteremia.
.
# Urinary Tract infection: Mr. ___ had a positive urine 
culture which grew MRSA. He was treated with vancomycin. 
Enterococcus was also isolated in the culture, but thought to be 
a contaminant.
.
# Sepsis - On the day of admission Mr. ___ fulfilled the 
criteria for SIRS. He was volume recusitated aggressively with 
normal saline. He was given acetaminophen for fevers and 
meperidine for rigors.  Serial blood cultures were drawn, which 
showed a high grade MRSA bacteremia.  Urine cultures also grew 
out MRSA and enterococcus.  Infectious disease and urology were 
consulted. A CT scan of the chest/abdomen/pelvis showed evidence 
of a fluid collection in the gallbladder bed.  This was drained 
by ___ and was shown to be a bilious fluid collection.  Cultures 
of this fluid showed no growth at the time of discharge. There 
was initially concern over a pneumonia based on imaging, but 
patient maintained his oxygenation and had no respiratory 
symptoms. He was initially on vancomycin and cefepime. This was 
narrowed to vancomycin. A TTE was performed which did not show 
any valvular vegetations. Based on these findings, ID 
recommended a total of 2 weeks of vancomycin therapy. A trough 
prior to discharge was within target range.
.
#Coronary artery disease - Mr. ___ has a history of diffuse 
CAD on recent catherization but no intervenable lesions. He had 
evidence of ectopy on telemetry.  The patient was chest pain 
free while rigoring. His EKG showed evidence of previous 
intraventricular conduction delay but no evidence of active 
ischemia. His metoprolol was initially held in the setting of 
his sepsis but re-started upon stabilization.
.
#Gallbladder CA - Per outpatient team his gemcitabine was held. 
He will follow up as an outpatient.
.
#Glucose intolerance - Placed on sliding scale while in the 
hospital. His Januvia was to be restarted at rehab.
.
# Hypertension - His antihypertensives were held given SIRS 
criteria. He was restarted on metoprolol and then lisinopril.

Calcium-8.9 Phos-2.9 Mg-2.___ y/o male with extensive PMH is taken to the OR with ___ ___ 
___ for a gallbladder mass seen on a screening CT.
At the time of the surgery they did not find any evidence of 
carcinomatosis. There was a nodule within the gallbladder at the 
fundus in proximity to the gallbladder fossa but appeared to be 
more in the free wall of the fundus rather than in proximity to 
the fossa itself.
Frozen section showed the mass consistent with gallbladder 
cancer and there was some concern that, in fact, it was invading 
the liver and the margin on the segment IVB
side was relatively close. At that time it was determined 
complete the IVB/V resections. An additional 1-2 cm of segment 
IVB and then extended this to the patient's left side all the 
way to the falciform ligament, taking segment V
and IVB with the specimen. The margin was taken all the way to 
the falciform ligament and then down to the left portal vein 
completely removing segment IVB and segment V. One drain was 
left in place and the patient was noted to have no 
complications.
Pathology returned as Adenocarcinoma, gallbladder with no 
carcinoma noted in the liver margins. Please see pathology 
report for final details.
In the post op period the patient remained afebrile. He was 
started back on a diet with good tolerance. Urine output was 
excellent with good function of the ileal conduit.
The JP drain had minimal and decreasing output daily and was 
pulled prior to discharge. 
He was tolerating diet, ambulating without difficulty and had 
return of bowel function. Incision was clean/dry intact.
AST and ALT were elevated on POD1 but were trending back to 
normal, T bili 0.4 and Alk phos stable.
Tumor markers were sent while in house:  CEA-9.1* AFP-2.4  CA 
___ - 287*   
Also of note the patient was having some elevated blood sugars 
post op.  Fasting ranging from 139 on day of discharge as high 
as 194. A HgbA1C was sent :%HbA1c-6.6* eAG-143* The patient has

Discharge Instructions:
You have been started on a new medication to control your heart 
rate, which was fast after your procedure.  The name of the 
medication is metoprolol, and you should take 12.5 mg by mouth 
twice a day.  Please follow up with your primary care physician 
within one week to adjust this medication as needed.  

Please take your catheter out as instructed on ___.  If 
you are unable to urinate within 8 hours, please call Dr. ___ 
___ go to the emergency room.  

Please use the large bag the majority of the time.  The leg bag 
is only for going out in public.  

Dr. ___ will call you with your pathology results.  If you 
have not heard from Dr. ___ in one week, please call his 
office for your results.  

The operation you have experienced is a "scraping" operation; 
that is to say, the bladder tumor or biopsy sample was "scraped" 
off the bladder wall. Bleeding was controlled with 
electrocautery which will produce a "scab" in the inside bladder 
wall. About ___ weeks after the operation, pieces of the scab 
will fall off and come out with the urine. As this occurs, 
bleeding may be noted which is normal. You should not worry 
about this. Simply lie down and increase your fluid intake for a 
few hours. In most cases, the urine will clear. Because of this 
tendency for bleeding, aspirin (or Advil) must be avoided for 2 
weeks following your operation (Tylenol is okay). If bleeding 
occurs or persists for more than 12 hours or if clots appear 
impairing your stream, call your urologist.

If you develop a fever over 101°, or have chills, call your 
urologist. Although not common, this may indicate infection that 
has developed beyond the control of the antibiotics that you 
have taken. 

It will take 6 weeks from the date of surgery to fully recover 
from your operation. This can be divided into two parts -- the 
first 2 weeks and the last 4 weeks. During the first 2 weeks 
from the date of your surgery, it is important to be "a person 
of leisure". You should avoid lifting and straining, which also 
means that you should avoid constipation. This can be done by 
any of 3 ways: 1) modify your diet, 2) use stool softeners which 
have been prescribed for you, and 3) use gentle laxatives such 
as Milk of Magnesia which can be purchased at your local drug 
store. It is important for you to avoid prolonged sitting. You 
should avoid sexual activity during this time. Also, avoid 
driving. The danger is not so much the driving, but it may delay 
you from urinating if you have the urge; and, "holding" urine 
may cause bleeding. If you return to work before 2 weeks, you 
may feel fatigued and require a decreased work load. 

During the second 4 week period of your recovery, you may begin 
regular activity, but only on a graduated basis. For example, 
you may feel well enough to return to work, but you may find it 
easier to begin on a half-day basis. It is common to become 
quite tired in the afternoon, and if such occurs, it is best to 
take a nap! Also, you may begin to drive as well as lift objects 
such as a briefcase, etc. If you are a golfer, you may begin to 
swing a golf club at this time. Sexual activity may be resumed 
during this time, but only on a limited basis. In general, your 
overall activity may be escalated to normal as you progress 
through this second time period, such that by ___ weeks 
following the date of surgery, you should be back to normal 
activity. If you take aspirin as a regular medication, it may be 
resumed at this time.

Finally, call your urologist in one week after your surgery for 
the results of your biopsy and your next appointment

Reports:
CT Head: 
1. Asymmetric hypodense focus within the right frontal lobe may 
represent
prior small vessel infarct, though edema secondary to small 
metastatic lesion is difficult to exclude. If there is clinical 
concern, MRI is recommended forexclusion of metastatic disease 
given its greater sensitivity.
2. No mass effect, intracranial hemorrhage, or acute large 
vascular territory
infarction.
3. Mucosal thickening in the left maxillary sinus with 
associated
post-surgical change.
4. Calcification of the cavernous and supraclinoid carotid 
arteries.
NOTE ADDED AT ATTENDING REVIEW: There are no findings to suggest 
infarction or metastatic disease. The white matter hypodensities 
are unchanged since ___, and presumably reflect chronic 
small vessel ischemia. There has been interval sinuse surgery 
with bilateral nasal antrostomies, ethmoidectomies and resection 
of middle turbinates.
.
CARDIAC CATHETERIZATION
1. Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system
demonstrated diffuse mild coronary artery disease.  The LMCA had 
mild
plaquing to 10%.  The LAD had focal moderate-heavy calcification 
with
tapering of the proximal-mid LAD at large S1 with diffuse 
plaquing in
the mid LAD and a 40% stenosis at the origin of the major D1.  
The LCx
had focal moderate-heavy calcification.  There was a 30% lesion 
at the
origin, a 30% lesion in the proximal vessel and a moderate 
stenosis in
the origin of short small OM2.  The AV groove Cx supplies a 
larger
atrial branch.  The ramus had a 30% lesion at the origin.  The 
RCA was
moderately calcified with a mid-vessel diffuse 30% lesion and a 
distal
diffuse 30% lesion.  There was a larger RPDA and moderate 
caliber
branching RPL.
2. Limited resting hemodynamic measurements demonstrated mildly
elevated left sided filling pressures with LVEDP of 17 mmHg.  
The
central aortic pressure was mildly elevated at 146/63 mmHg.  
There was
no gradient upon pullback from left ventricle to aorta.
3. Pressure wire interrogation was performed on the lesion at 
the origin
of D1.  With maximal hyperemia induced by AV adenosine 
(complicated by
2:1 AV conduction at 1 min 50 seconds) the fractional flow 
reserved was
0.87 with equalization of pressure upon pullback of the pressure 
wire
back into the guiding catheter.
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:

Brief Hospital Course:
#UTI: UA was grossly positive for infection. He was febrile to 
102-103 in the ED and up to 104 on the floor. Other signs of 
infection included tachycardia, leukocytosis (WBC 13.2).  His 
urostomy places him at risk of UTI. Given his male gender and 
urostomy, his UTI is classified as complicated UTI. He was 
started on ceftriaxone 1 gm q24h and Meropenem 500 mg IV Q8H. 
Urine Cultures and blood cultures grew pan sensitive e. coli and 
antibiotic changed to ciprfloxacin. 
.
#Tachycardia: Patient had several episodes of tachycardia to 
160s, treated with metoprolol iv. Appeared to be SVT on 
telemetry but may have been atrial tachycardia as HR came down 
slowly with metoprol and did not break as would be expected with 
SVT. Cardiac enzymes were mildly elevated to 0.06 but trended 
down, likely from demand ischemia. Tachycardia likely secondary 
to missing several doses of home metoprolol, volume depletion 
and infection. His dose of metoprolol was increased to 25 mg po 
bid as an outpatient. 

#Altered mental status: He was oriented only to person and 
hospital on arrival to the floor. He was also lethargic. His 
mental status improved by hospital day 2 and was likely 
secondary to acute infection and dehydration. 

___: baseline creatinine 1.0, was elevated to 1.5 on admission. 
Etiology was likely from volume depletion from poor po intake. 
His lisinopril was held and was given IV fluids. His creatinine 
trended down to 1.2 on discharge and his lisinopril was 
restarted. 

#Hypertension: Had an episode of hypertension to 199 in setting 
of missing home meds. He was treated with hydralazine then 
metoprolol increased to 25 mg po tid. BP normal at discharge and 
dischaged on metoprolol 25 mg po bid and lisinopril 20 mg po qd. 


#Gallbladder Cancer: getting treatment with gemzar, last dose 
___, >3 weeks ago, no longer at risk for febrile neutropenia. 
He will follow-up as an outpatient. 

#Bladder Cancer: s/p bladder resection with ileal conduit. 
Urostomy places patient at increased risk for UTI. He will 
follow-up with his outpatient oncologist.
.
# Hx of CAD: Had elevated cardiac biomarkers to 0.06 in setting 
of demand ischemia from tachycardia but now signficant QRS 
changes. He was continued on his home doses of simvastatin, 
metoprolol, aspirin.

Compared to chest radiographs since ___, most recently ___. 
 Lung volumes are much lower exaggerating mild pulmonary edema 
and mild 
cardiomegaly, however mediastinal veins are more distended and 
unless this is a supine radiograph, that indicates elevated 
central venous pressure or 
volume.  The only focal pulmonary abnormality, heterogeneous 
peribronchial 
opacification in the right lower lobe is unchanged since ___.  This 
could be atelectasis or very small region of pneumonia.  No 
pneumothorax.

pneumonia on CXR, pyelonephritis, E.coli septicemia, acute on 
chronic systolic heart failure, and acute on chronic renal 
failure. 

#E.coli urosepsis: Patient has long history of recurrent UTI and 
has previously grown out MRSA and Enterococcus. Urine culture 
and blood culture from ___ were found to have E.coli growth. 
He was initially treated with vancomycin ___ 
cefepime (___). On ___, he triggered for tachypnea to 
48 and increased confusion and was transferred to the ICU. In 
the ICU, antibiotic coverage was narrowed to ceftriaxone 
(___) based on urine and blood culture growing 
pansensitive E.coli. He was transferred to the floor on ___ 
and a midline was placed for antibiotic administration. He will 
complete 14 day course of ceftriaxone after discharge (last day 
___.

#Multifocal pneumonia: CXR ___ showed evidence of ill-defined 
opacities in the mid to lower lungs noted bilaterally, L>R, 
concerning for multifocal pneumonia. This is likely new 
pneumonia given previous CAP (___) was found to be a lower 
lobe pneumonia but unclear picture as patient also presented 
with pulmonary edema. Patient was transferred to the ICU after 
he had tachypnea and increased confsion. He was initially 
treated with cefepime but narrowed to ceftriaxone in the ICU 
after improvement in respiratory status. Azithromycin 
(___) was added when he had fever to 103.2 overnight on 
___. 

#Acute on chronic kidney failure: Patient presented with Cr of 
1.6 up from baseline of 1.1-1.2 initially caused by prerenal 
azotemia from sepsis and secondarily by cardiorenal syndrome in 
the setting of volume overload. With diuresis, Cr downtrended to 
1.2-1.3 at the time of discharge. 

#Transaminitis: LFTs downtrended to ALT/AST 118/60 on discharge. 
On admission, ALT 137 AST 89 Alk phos 138 with normal Tbili 0.7 
up from baseline normal LFTs. Likely congestive hepatopathy 
given volume overload and secondary to ceftrriaxone. RUQ U/S 
notable only for steatosis. Of note, the patient takes a lot of 
over the counter supplements, and this should be addressed on 
the outpatient setting.  

#Acute Metabolic Encephalopathy: Encephalopathy and delirium 
improved significantly with IVF, treatment of infection, and 
increased metoprolol. Encephalopathy secondary to delirium and 
infection significantly improved with treatment of infection as 
well.

#Ectopy/nonsustained ventricular tachycardia: Patient developed 
significant ectopy in the setting of infection on ___. 
Cardiology recommended increasing metoprolol to TID dosing with 
improvement in amount of ectopy seen on telemetry. 

# Type II DM: Blood glucose is elevated this admission. Last 
HbA1c 7.4% and patient has refused treatment in the outpatient 
setting. Likely worsened in the setting of infection. Insulin 
sliding scale was used in the hospital.

CHRONIC ISSUES

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
====================
[] SUPPLEMENTS: Please address over the counter supplements as 
patient presented with transaminitis.
[] LAB WORK: Please check LFT and CHEM10 on ___.
[] CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE: Patient presented with fluid 
overload and last echo was ___. Consider repeat 
echocardiogram in the outpatient setting. Fluid overload was 
thought to be secondary to fluid resuscitation in the setting of 
sepsis; if he develops persistent fluid overload consider 
standing diuresis in the outpatient setting.
[] MEDICATION CHANGES: 
NEW MEDICATIONS: CEFTRIAXONE (___)
CHANGED MEDICATIONS: Metoprolol was increased from BID to TID 
because of increased ectopy in setting of infection. 
STOPPED MEDICATIONS: Lisinopril was stopped in setting of sepsis 
and ___. Blood pressure on discharge was 110's/70's. Consider 
restarting this medication if hypertension is noted in the

conduit/urostomy and gallbladder carcinoma s/p ccy/partial 
hepatectomy presents with three days of worsening 
weakness/dizziness. Pt reports several months of feeling 
fatigued as well as ___ weakness which he believes is primarily 
secondary to hip pain. On review of records, he has a h/o hip 
pain which was evaluated by orthopedics and felt to be secondary 
to a right gluteus medius/minimus muscle strain in tendinopathy. 
He states his ___ weakness and hip pain has improved with ___.

Pt states he went golfing last week and then experienced 
worsening fatigue. He noted his urine output in his urostomy 
bag, which is normally clear yellow, was dark and cloudy. He has 
also believes he may have had some subjective fevers at home as 
well. In the setting of feeling unwell for several days, he 
thinks he may have lost up to 10 lb. Denies cough, SOB, 
wheezing, CP, n/v/d. No abdominal pain or change in bowel 
habits. No recent travel or sick contacts. Per family members, 
patient appeared somewhat confused and fatigued. Pt was seen by 
his physician who obtained labs, significant for positive UA. 

In the ED, initial vitals: 102.9 60 166/45 24 95% ra  
-Labs were signficant for wbc ct 11.8, h/h 12.6/36.3, Cr 1.5, 
trop 0.01, lactate 2.3. UA with many bacteria, mod leuks, pos 
nitrites. 
-Imaging signficant for CXR with relatively low lung volumes, 
which accentuate the bronchovascular markings. Given this, 
subtle bibasilar opacities may relate to vascular crowding, 
however, underlying infection cannot be excluded in the 
appropriate clinical setting. 
-Pt was noted to have frequent NSVT ___ sec runs) on arrival. 
Cardiology was consulted who recommended to treat primary 
infection, no indication for anti-arrythmics.
-Pt was given 1L NS, zosyn and tylenol.
-On transfer, vitals were:  99.5 87 110/46 16 98% Nasal Cannula 

On arrival to the MICU, pt states he is feeling well. Denies any 
CP, SOB, abd pain, n/v.  

Of note, he was last hospitalized in ___ with presumed 
urosepsis (urine/blood cx not positive that admission). Prior 
cx's include MRSA, Enterococcus, Pan sensitive E coli, Pan 
sensitive klebsiella oxytoca. 

Review of systems:  
(+) Per HPI  
(-) Denies headache, sinus tenderness, congestion. Denies cough, 
shortness of breath, or wheezing. Denies chest pain, chest 
pressure, palpitations, or weakness. Denies nausea, vomiting, 
diarrhea, constipation, abdominal pain, or changes in bowel 
habits.  Denies rashes or skin changes.

==== IMAGING ====

EKG (___):
Marked resting sinus tachycardia with atrial premature beats. 
Frequent 
ventricular premature beats and a five beat run of non-sustained 
ventricular tachycardia at a rate of about 160. Left atrial 
abnormality. Intraventricular conduction delay with left axis 
deviation. Non-specific ST-T wave changes. Cannot exclude prior 
inferior wall myocardial infarction. Cannot exclude anterior 
wall myocardial infarction in the presence of the 
intraventricular conduction delay. Compared to the previous 
tracing of ___ non-sustained ventricular tachycardia is now 
seen. Clinical correlation is suggested. 

CXR (___):
Relatively low lung volumes, which accentuate the 
bronchovascular markings. Given this, subtle bibasilar opacities 
may relate to vascular crowding, however, underlying infection 
cannot be excluded in the appropriate clinical setting. If 
clinical concern persists, suggest dedicated PA and lateral 
views when patient able.

TTE (___):
The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left 
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is mildly 
dilated. There is mild regional left ventricular systolic 
dysfunction with probable inferior hypokinesis. The remaining 
segments contract normally (LVEF = 40-45%). Right ventricular 
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The diameters of 
aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels are normal. There 
is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. 
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. There is no pericardial 
effusion. 
IMPRESSION: Suboptimal study. Mild regional left ventricular 
systolic dysfunction, c/w CAD. Compared with the prior study 
(images reviewed) of ___, the findings are similar.  

EKG (___):
Resting sinus tachycardia. Compared to the previous tracing of 
___ 
abnormalities are as reported including frequent ventricular 
premature 
beats with a single ventricular couplet. Non-sustained 
ventricular tachycardia is not noted on the present tracing. P-R 
interval prolongation, especially considering the heart rate. 
Clinical correlation is suggested. 

CXR (___):
As compared to previous radiograph of 1 day earlier, increased 
lung volumes are associated with improved aeration at both lung 
bases.  No other relevant changes. 

RENAL ULTRASOUND (___):
Normal kidneys bilaterally.  No perinephric abscess identified.

 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ male with history of bladder cancer s/p ileal 
conduit/urostomy and gallbladder carcinoma s/p cholecystectomy 
and partial hepatectomy who presented with three days of 
worsening weakness/dizziness, subsequently found to have sepsis 
from a urinary source.

# Sepsis: On admission, patient met ___ SIRS criteria with 
fevers and leukocytosis. Presumed source was urinary given 
positive UA and h/o urosepsis in past, as well as predisposition 
to UTI due to his urostomy. CXR could not rule out infection 
however no clinical signs of pneumonia such as cough or SOB. 
Initially admitted to MICU given hypotension to mid-80s systolic 
blood pressure. His hypotension was readily responsive to 2L of 
normal saline. He was treated with vancomycin and zosyn given 
prior urine culture data dating back to ___ with various 
organisms including Klebsiella (zosyn sensitive), MRSA, 
enterococcus, and pan-sensitive E.coli. This admission, his 
urine culture grew Klebsiella oxytoca (resistant only to 
ampicillin/sulbactam) and pan-sensitive E.coli. He was therefore 
switched from vanc/zosyn to ciprofloxacin PO on ___. Bilateral 
renal ultrasound on ___ revealed no evidence of perinephric 
abscess. Blood cultures were without growth at time of 
discharge.

# Non-Sustained Ventricular Tachycardia: Patient had multiple 
runs of NSVT on arrival to ED, likely triggered by sepsis. 
Cardiology was consulted and recommended outpatient stress test 
with imaging once the patient recovers from his acute illness. 
They also recommended re-initiation of his beta blocker once 
hemodynamically stable from his sepsis. His metoprolol was 
subsequently restarted on ___. The patient's ectopy became 
notably less frequent with treatment of his sepsis and 
improvement in his clinical condition. TTE revealed no 
significant changes from his prior study. He will undergo an 
outpatient cardiac stress test with imaging to be arranged by 
his cardiologist Dr. ___.

==== TRANSITIONAL ISSUES ====

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the Urology service after undergoing 
cystectomy and creation of an ileal conduit on ___.  Please 
see the dictated operative note for details.  He was initially 
admitted to the ICU, where he was kept intubated overnight and 
extubated in the AM.  His ICU course was essentially 
uncomplicated.  He did have one night of delirium and confusion 
that required administration of haldol.  This resolved in the AM 
and did not occur again in his hospitalizion. 

He was transferred to the floor, where he he progressed well, 
slowly advancing his diet after passage of flatus and ambulating 
with the help of ___.  On ___, he was noted to have 
significant drainage of clear serous fluid from the lower aspect 
of his midline abdominal wound.  An ostomy bag was placed over 
the wound, with output > 1L/day.  This fluid was sent for 
creatinine, which was noted to be significantly elevated, highly 
suspicious for urine leak.  A CT Urogram was performed on 
___ which demonstrated extravasation of contrast around the 
ileal conduit.  The exact location of the leak could not be 
localized.  

On ___, a loop-o-gram was performed under fluouroscopy in an 
attempt to localize the urine leak.  Unfortunately, the leak 
could not be localized.  On ___, a left antegrade 
nephrostogram was performed, which demonstrated that the left 
ureteroileal anastamosis was intact and without a leak.  The 
scan did demonstrate a persistent extravasation of contrast 
which once again, could not be localized.  

On ___, repeat L antegrade nephrostogram and L PCN removal 
was performed, which again demonstrated a leak that could not be 
localized.  A urethral catheter was placed to drain the 
abdominal cavity.  At first, this drained significantly, and the 
fluid was sent for creatinine, which was consistent with urine.  
A catheter was also placed into the ileal loop to decompress the 
loop.  This drained significantly, and also significantly 
reduced the amount of drainage from the abdominal drain.  In 
fact, creatinine checks of the abdominal drain after catheter 
decompression of the loop were NOT consistent with urine (all 
creatinines were <1.5).  

The patient's urine leak was therefore managed conservatively 
with catheter decompression of the loop.  Multiple CT Urograms 
were performed to evaluate the urine leak, which reduced 
significantly before discharge.  The ostomy appliance was 
changed before discharge, and the catheter in the urostomy was 
replaced and sutured to the ostomy appliance.  Strict 
instructions were given to the rehab facility not to manipulate 
the ostomy appliance or the catheter decompressing the loop.  Of 
onte, three days before discharge, the output from the pt's 
abdominal drain appeared milky.  It was sent for triglycerides, 
which was elevated > 110, consistent with a small chylous leak.  
However, the volume of leak/day was significantly < 500 cc, and 
was therefore considered not to be clinically significant.  
Nevertheless, the patient was instructed to eat a low-fat diet 
high in medium-chain triglycerides.  Before discharge, the 
patient completed a seven day course of ceftriaxone for empiric 
prophylaxis against forming infected fluid collections in the 
pelvis.  The pt remained afebrile throughout his 
hospitalization.  On discharge to rehab, he was walking without 
difficulty, including traversing stairs, his urostomy was 
draining well with catheter decompression, and his urethral 
catheter was removed.  He was given instructions to call Dr. 
___ office to arrange a f/u appt the ___ after 
discharge, at which point his ostomy appliance would be changed 
with the help of the ostomy nurse.

WITH SKIN
      AND/OR GENITAL CONTAMINATION. 

STUDIES:

Cardiovascular ReportECGStudy Date of ___  6:06:10 ___
 
Sinus tachycardia. Left bundle-branch block. Frequent 
ventricular premature
beats. Compared to the previous tracing the rate has increased.

CHEST TWO VIEWS, ___
 
FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest.  There are faint 
bibasilar
opacities, potentially due to atelectasis.  Superiorly, the 
lungs are clear. 
The cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits, top 
normal in size. 
Atherosclerotic calcification is seen at the aortic arch.  No 
acute osseous
abnormality is identified.  Surgical clips seen in the right 
upper quadrant.
 
IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary process.

CT head non-contrast ___:

FINDINGS:
 
There is no evidence of hemorrhage, edema, mass effect, or large 
vascular
territorial infarction.  Prominent ventricles and sulci suggest 
age related
global atrophy.  Minimal subcortical white matter hypodensities 
are
nonspecific but likely sequelae from chronic small vessel 
ischemic disease,
unchanged.  The basal cisterns appear patent and there is 
preservation of
gray-white matter differentiation.  
 
No fracture is identified.  There is moderate mucosal thickening 
of the
bilateral ethmoid air cells.  The patient is status post prior 
sinus surgery. 
The remaining visualized paranasal sinuses, mastoid air cells, 
and middle ear
cavities are clear.  The globes are unremarkable.  
 
IMPRESSION:
 
No evidence of acute intracranial process.  

 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ year old M w/ history of transitional cell CA sp 
cystoprostatectomy with ileal loop conduit ___, in 
remission), gallbladder carcinoma s/p ___, 
cyberknife and chemo (coompleted in 
___, recurrent UTIs and bacteremia, who presents with 
generalized weakness, unstable gait, found to have positive UA, 
likely consistent with UTI/urosepsis.  

#Urosepsis: Pt with h/o of recurrent UTIs/bacteremia from ileal 
conduit. Prior cx's include MRSA, Enterococcus, Pan sensitive E 
coli, Pan sensitive klebsiella oxytoca. He presented with 
generalized weakness, difficulty ambulating, a positive UA, 
relative leukocytosis, and ___ SIRS criteria. Cultures from 
blood/urine from this admission never grew out but this was 
presumed to be recurrent urosepsis. He clinically improved 
significantly with 6L IVF resuscitation empiric coverage with 
vancomycin/cefepime. Lactate trended down. There was no CVA 
tenderness to suggest perinephri abscess. He was transitioned to 
PO Bactrim to complete a 2 week course.

# SIRS criteria: Felt to likely be ___ recurrent urosepsis as 
above. There was no e/o pna on CXR. No diarrhea to suggest 
Cdiff. Skin findings were not c/w cellulitis. No neuro findings 
or back pain to suggest epidural abscess. No headache to suggest 
meningitis. Not on steroids so AI was felt to be unlikely. SIRS 
criteria resolved with IVF and antibiotics as above.

___: Cr 2.2 on presentation (baseline: 1.0-1.4). FeNa 0.88, 
likely representing pre-renal azotemia in the setting of poor PO 
intake and sepsis. There may have been a component of contrast 
induced nephropathy as received contrast dose on ___. Improved 
to 1.4 at discharge with IVF and supportive measures, with mml 
urine output. 

# Unstable gait: Head CT was neg. Neuro exam was non-focal, no 
back pain or spinal tenderness on exam, rectal tone was wnl. He 
had spinal imaging 2 days prior to admission which showed spinal 
DJD. Gait difficulties were felt to likely be ___ systemic 
illness and hypovolemia. Pt was able to ambulate without 
difficulty prior to discharge.

# Skin findings: Elbow and axillae erythema were c/w contact 
dermatitis. Excoriations were noted under the abdominal binder 
on his left flank. Given Triamcinalone to contact dermatitis 
areas and Bactroban to excoriations.

# CAD: Cath in ___ with diffuse but no critical dx. Denied 
CP/SOB, EKG was non-ischemic. It was unclear why pt stopped his 
statin. Held home metoprolol and lisinopril on admission given 
sepsis but restarted these at discharge. Continued home aspirin.

#HTN: BP stable during this admission. As above, held home 
metoprolol and lisinopril on admission given sepsis but 
restarted these at discharge.

#Glaucoma: Continued home eye drops. 
  
#Gallbladder Carcinoma: sp resection in ___, cyberknife and 
chemo (completed in ___. Stable with low ___ and no 
evidence of disease progression per recent CT.  

#Bladder Cancer: s/p bladder resection with ileal conduit in 
___. No e/o recurrence on CT recently.  

Transition issues:
- Outpt PCP ___ as above
- Complete a 2 week course of Bactrim through ___ 
- ___ pending blood cultures 
- Consider restarting statin as outpatient if patient is able to 
tolerate
