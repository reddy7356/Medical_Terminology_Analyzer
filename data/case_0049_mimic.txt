History of Present Illness:
Ms. ___ is an ___ year-old woman residing at ___ 
___ with a history of HTN, T2DM and depression who is 
transferred due to lethargy, hypoxia and leukocytosis.  

Per nursing home notes, on ___ the patient was observed to be 
lethargic and to have a new hypoxia to 83% requiring 2L O2 to 
reach 93%. Labs were obtained revealing WBC 35.2. A CXR was 
obtained which was reportedly negative. The patient was started 
on levofloxacin 500mg. On ___ in the morning her WBC was 38.4. 
The patient's HCP was called and her HCP was activated leading 
to inactivation of her Do not hospitalize order, thus the 
patient was transferred to ___.  
 
 In the ED, initial vitals were: 99.0 | 104 | 94/52 | 16 | 100% 
NRB  
 -ED exam: A&Ox1, TTP in lower abdomen, poor respiratory effort

___, alb 3.1, lactate 2, VBG pCO2 49, UA WBC 13, RBC 6, nit 
(-)  
 -CXR: "Lung volumes are quite low which limits assessment. 
There is lower lung atelectasis. "  
 -CT Abd/Pel: "Partially imaged bibasilar airspace opacities may 
reflect atelectasis but pneumonia is not completely excluded. 
Large fecal loading."  
-CT Chest:   
1. Mild ___ nodularity and consolidation in the right 
lower lobe likely reflects a combination of infection and 
atelectasis. 
2. Left basilar consolidation is more likely representative of 
atelectasis. 
3. Coronary atherosclerotic disease. 
4. Pulmonary arterial enlargement suggests underlying pulmonary 
arterial hypertension. 
 

 On the floor, the patient appears comfortable. She endorses 
mild dyspnea, but otherwise denies chest pain, abdominal pain,

IMAGING:
====================
___, Chest Portable AP

AP portable upright view of the chest.   Lung volumes are quite 
low which 
limits assessment.  There is lower lung atelectasis.  The mid 
upper lungs 
appear well aerated.  There is a calcified structure projecting 
over the 
mediastinum and left apex, question thyroid lesion, not fully 
assessed.  Heart 
size cannot be assessed.  Mediastinal contour appears normal.  
There is 
bronchovascular crowding at the hila mostly noted on the right.  
Bony 
structures are intact.  Vertebroplasty changes are noted in the 
lower 
thoracic/upper lumbar spine. 

___, CT abdomen and pelvis

IMPRESSION: 
1. 2.2 x 1.8 cm hypodense lesion in the uncinate process of the 
pancreas, most likely reflective of a cystic neoplasm.  Further 
assessment with MRCP is recommended. 
2. Partially imaged bibasilar airspace opacities may reflect 
atelectasis but pneumonia is not completely excluded. 
3. Diverticulosis without evidence of diverticulitis. 
4. Multiple severe vertebral body compression deformities within 
the lower 
thoracic and upper lumbar spine.  Chronic left inferior pubic 
ramus fracture. 
5. Large fecal load within the rectum. 

___, CT chest
1. Mild ___ nodularity and consolidation in the right 
lower lobe 
likely reflects a combination of infection and atelectasis. 
2. Left basilar consolidation is more likely representative of 
atelectasis. 
3. Coronary atherosclerotic disease. 
4. Pulmonary arterial enlargement suggests underlying pulmonary 
arterial 
hypertension. 
 
Brief Hospital Course:

leukocytosis, bandemia, vacuolization, toxic granulation,  
platelet clumping with unremarkable RBCs. Normal neutrophil 
differentiation r/o etiology like CML. CT chest w/evidence of R 
base pneumonia.  Urine cx negative. CT a/p without evidence of 
infection. Blood cx pending. She was empirically covered 
overnight with Vanc/Zosyn > vanc/cefepime > ceftriaxone. She was 
then transitioned to PO cefpodoxime to complete 7 day course 
(end date ___.

# Health Care Associated Pneumonia with sepsis: Leukocytosis, 
fever, tachycardia, hypoxia, infectious source known, and ___ 
upon admission. Leukocytosis and hypoxia improved with treatment 
of HCAP as above. Pt discharged on PO cefpoxodime. 
 
 # ___: Resolved. Patient presented with ___, pre renal given 
improvement in IVF overnight   
 
 # Bilateral ___ edema: Unclear chronicity. BNP, checked in ED, 
is elevated though clinically no evidence of heart failure. Can 
consider further evaluation with ECHO upon discharge but no 
clinical indication at this time
 
 # Constipation/Fecal loading: Pt noted to have stool burden on 
CT A/P. Pt treated with bowel regimen had bowel movements during 
hospitalization.
 
# Dementia: Continued on home medications.

restarted with clinical improvement. 

**Transitional issues**

(end date ___

goals of care. 
-Blood cx pending upon d/c, negative to date at discharge
