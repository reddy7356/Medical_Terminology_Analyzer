Conclusions  
Prebypass
No spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the body of the left 
atrium or left atrial appendage. No atrial septal defect is seen 
by 2D or color Doppler. There is mild symmetric left ventricular 
hypertrophy. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion 
are normal. There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic 
aorta. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but 
aortic stenosis is not present. Trace aortic regurgitation is 
seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate 
(2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is no pericardial 
effusion. Dr. ___ was notified in person of the 
results on ___ at 1345. 

Post bypass
No sign of aortic injury or dissection. EF 55%. No new wall 
motion abnormalities. MR now ___. Exam otherwise unchanged from 
prior.

K-4.4 Cl-107 HCO3-25 AnGap-___ w/ CAD and chest pain admitted for cath abnormal stress test 
by cardiologist, had L heart cath on ___ which showed 3-vessel 
disease, requiring urgent CABG. Patient was started on a heparin 
gtt and optimized medically prior to consulting cardiac surgery. 
Cardiac surgery workup was expeditiously completed and patient 
was made NPO prior to surgery.
The patient was admitted to the hospital and brought to the 
operating room on ___ where the patient underwent CABG x 
5(LIMA->LAD, SVG->OM1, OM2, PDA, Diag).  Overall the patient 
tolerated the procedure well and post-operatively was 
transferred to the CVICU in stable condition for recovery and 
invasive monitoring.  Vancomycin and Kefzol were used for 
surgical antibiotic prophylaxis.  POD 1 found the patient 
extubated, alert and oriented and breathing comfortably.  The 
patient was neurologically intact and hemodynamically stable on 
no inotropic or vasopressor support.  Beta blocker was initiated 
and the patient was gently diuresed toward the preoperative 
weight. The patient was transferred to the telemetry floor for 
further recovery. Chest tubes and pacing wires were discontinued 
without complication. The patient did have a small stable right 
pneumothorax after chest tubes were pulled. The patient was 
evaluated by the physical therapy service for assistance with 
strength and mobility. He became hypotensive and tachycardic 
working with ___ on POD4.  Lopressor was titrated up for better 
rate control. He should follow up with cardiologist regarding 
restarting Digoxin (on preop) for rate control.  This was not 
restarted as Lopressor was being titrated up. By the time of 
discharge on POD 5 the patient was ambulating freely, the wound 
was healing and pain was controlled with oral analgesics. POD5 
he cleared ___. The patient was discharged home with visiting 
nurse services in good condition with appropriate follow up 
instructions.
