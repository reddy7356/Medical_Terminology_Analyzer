PO. 

ACTIVE ISSUES
# ABDOMINAL PAIN: known prior history of IBS, as well as ovarian 
cancer. Recently admitted to ___, as well as seen at ___, for 
abdominal pain, with negative work up (labs & imaging). 
Furthermore, history of pain seems most consistent with IBS 
(relief of symptoms with bowel movements & no other alarm 
signs). Presented with mild sitophobia (able to tolerate 
liquids). Furthermore, review of outpatient oncology records 
(most recent visit, ___ notes that she has no evidence of 
worsening disease and that her CA-125 remains normal & stable. 
Furthermore, she frequently visits the ED despite having 
educated the patient of its appropriate use. Here, given IVF, 
and slowly advanced diet. Started dicyclomine & simethicone for 
symptoms, with good effect. Provided reassurance as well. 
Tolerating full diet on discharge. Instructed on low FODMAP 
diet. 

CHRONIC ISSUES
# DEPRESSION,
# ANXIETY: continued aripiprazole, amitriptyline, duloxetine,
lorazepam. 
# DEVELOPMENTAL DELAY
# HYPOTHYROIDISM: continued levothyroxine 50 mcg daily, except 
for
___ (100 mcg). 
# GERD: continued omeprazole 40 mg daily 
# RAYNAUD'S DISEASE, AND 
# UNDIFFERENTIATED CONNECTIVE TISSUE DISORDER
# HYPERTENSION: held losartan 50 mg daily for BPs in low 100s. 
# CHRONIC PAIN: continued gabapentin, morpine ___ PRN. 

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES
===================
# Hypertension: held losartan at discharge, given BPs in low 
100s
# IBS: consider increasing amitriptyline if no response to new 
treatments

I attest that >30 minutes was spent on coordination of care & 
discharge planning.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:

History of Present Illness:
___ year old female with recurrent high grade serous ovarian
cancer s/p ___ screw fixation of left femoral neck stress
fracture (per imaging not clear fracture was pathologic) 
presents
with persistent left hip and pleuritic chest pain. This is her
third ED visit for this in 2 days. 

She was last seen by oncology ___. She had disease recurrence
in ___ of this year, and after resection of pelvic nodule in
___, started carboplatin q4 weeks in ___, but this was limited
by thrombocytopenia, and ultimately she has been on treatment
break for now (last dose ___ was ___ due to marked 
bone
marrow effects of cumulative chemo.  More recently she is s/p
pinning of a left femoral neck stress fracture on ___,
discharged ___ to rehab. She was discharged from rehab ___ and
presented to our ED that day ___ reporting fever and mildly
increased pain in left hip. She had no objective fever in the 
ED.
Ortho was consulted for c/f erythema at incision site and they
felt that there was no erythema, incisions were c/d/I, and range
of motion was equal bilaterally. They did not feel any signs 
were
present of post operative infection. XR of the hip showed no
fracture or hardware complication.  she reported chest pain
during that admission and had a chest CT to rule out PE that was
negative. ___ also showed no DVT. WBC was 4.7, hct was 28, plts
139. The ED team felt that UA was c/w UTI so she was started on
macrobid. She was discharged ___. Urine culture at this point
has come back with mixed flora. This morning, immediately after
discharge from our ED, she went to ___ ED, 
where
reportedly (see OMR note PA contacted our ___ dept) it was felt
she was having likely somatization, reportedly CXR clear, no
acute process found. This evening she re-presented to our ED
after leaving ___ ED.

She describes to me on this interview that at rehab she was
having pain, but the same pain got worse at home. It feels like 
a
sharp stabbing pain in the left hip. She has been walking with
cane and doing stairs slowly, but still having persistent pain 
in
the hip and is concerned about it. Ever since she left rehab she
feels a substernal stabbing chest pain - states this has been
going on for ___ days. She's actually not sure which day she 
left
rehab though other OMR notes suggest it was just ~3 days ago. 
She
states that "so many things have been going on" and she just
can't remember which day she left rehab. She also reports that
she has burning pain with urination. This pain with urination
started yesterday in the ED - she states she didn't feel the 
pain
until she was told in the ED that she has a UTI, but then she
started noticing the pain. She feels this pain has improved 
after
starting the antibiotic. She has been taking only one morphine
pill (15 mg per day). She isn't sure why she isn't taking the
morphine more often if she is having such bad pain. She also
stopped taking the standing Tylenol that she was discharged 
with.
All other 10 point ROS neg.

pelvic and paraaortic lymph node dissection, and omentectomy in 
___, who presents with acute on chronic abdominal pain.

# Abdominal Pain
# Peritoneal malignant disease
# Constipation
Etiology of abdominal pain is most likely due to extensive 
peritoneal malignant
disease, however degree of pain seems to be out of proportion to 
burden of disease, and pt has multiple recurrent ED and clinic 
visits/admits for abdominal pain without acute process found on 
imaging or labs. Admission CT did not reveal any acute process. 
Lipase/LFTs reassuring. Pain improved w/ fentanyl patch increase 
from 12mcg to 25 mcg, however suspect significant anxiety 
component/driver which outpt providers echoed. Another 
contributor is constipation; pt goes through cycles at home 
where she won't take bowel regimen (forgets bowel meds) and then 
gets constipated and 5 days later takes a lot of laxatives and 
has profound diarrhea, which exhausts her. Fatigue and low 
energy is the result, see below, also prompting admissions and 
ED visit. Pychiatry and SW involved, agree large anxiety 
component to trigger/underlying abd pain. Instructed pt to take 
200mg BID Colace (doesn't like senna, causes cramps), daily 
miralax, and every other day dulcolax. If no BM, can use mg 
citrate prn or enemas. Increased fentanyl as above, restarted 
simethicone and bentyl, contd home morphine ___ and Tylenol and 
amitriptyline qhs which may help w/ the cramps, and PPI. Pain 
improved on DC. Per recommendation of oncology team, will refer 
pt to GI for further workup/management of severe abd pain out of 
proportion to findings on labs/imaging and for management of 
alternating constipation and loose stools as noted.
I reviewed the PMP for this patient. No other sufficient 
non-narcotic alternative for her metastatic peritoneal disease 
and abd pain.

# Anxiety - significant contributor to symptomatology most 
likely. pt does very well when providers in the room and having 
social interactions, but feels parents don't understand her or 
that her pain is real. Arranged for SW to see pt at home via 
___. SW following in house along w/ palliative care.

# Ovarian Cancer, Metastatic, Recurrent She is now on C2 of 
carboplatin every 3 weeks. Anticipate blood counts may be 
dropping due to recent chemo. Dr. ___ 
following while inpatient.

# Profound fatigue - suspect chemo effect, blood count improved 
today though anemia may be contributor. TSH WNL ___. Pt not 
orthostatic at time of discharge. Suspect however that cycle of 
constipation then diarrhea then constipation due to bowel 
regimen discrepancies are contributing to sense of feeling 
drained. Blood counts stably low, no e/o bleeding.

# Pancytopenia
# Anemia
# Neutropenia: Afebrile. ANC 1190. C2 carboplatin. Subacute 
progression of anemia since restarting chemo therapy. 

# Hypothyroid;
- Con't home levothyroxine

# Depression:
- Continued home amitriptyline, aripiprazle, and Cymbalta 
- Continued home At___

# Nausea:
- Zofran prn nausea

# GERD:

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,

It was a pleasure taking care of you at ___ 
___. You were admitted because you had worsening of 
your chronic abdominal pain. A CT scan and lab work was 
reassuring. We suspect the abdominal pain and bloating are side 
effects of your cancer. Also constipation is a contributor, and 
alternating between constipation and diarrhea with laxatives is 
making you exhausted. We gave you IV fluids initially. We 
increased your fentanyl patch and started you on simethicone. 
You will follow up with Dr. ___ for further 
management. We have also set up an appointment for you to see 
our gastroenterologists if you wish. if you get anxious, please 
use your Ativan. 

For constipation prevention and treatment:

Please take 200mg Colace twice a day
(senna gives you cramps so we are holding off on that)
Please take your miralax daily
Please take your dulcolax every other day.
If you go a day without having a bowel movement, the following 
day you should take 300mL of magnesium citrate also and keep 
using that daily until you do have a bowel movement. 
If two days go by without a bowel movement, you can give 
yourself an enema.

if you have diarrhea and cramping, please hold the bowel 
medications until that resolves.

We increased your narcotics (fentanyl) so very important you 
follow this bowel regimen to prevent constipation!

presents with dysuria and pelvic pain.

1. Dysuria and pelvic pain h/o ovarian cancer
-Patient has had pelvic pain before both related to and not 
related to malignancy.  Imaging and labs including urine culture 
do not explain pain.  At this point suspect constipation as 
source of pain.  Patient also regularly goes to ___ with similar 
complaints and given her malignancy history suspect she could 
also have a component of anxiety worsening her pain.  Appreciate 
GYN-ONC recommendations who noted normal pelvic exam, 
recommended flexural, and recommended outpatient integrative 
care follow up.  Also appreciate patient's outpatient oncology 
team who saw patient who notes low clinical suspicion of 
malignancy in lieu of unremarkable imaging and normal CA-125 2 
weeks ago.  Oncology also noted that she frequently is evaluated 
in the ___ for pain.  At this point oncology recommend outpatient 
follow up with them and are okay with bridging discharge home 
with morphine.  

2. Hypotension h/o HTN
-?symptomatic hypotension as patient didn't report symptoms 
until she was told her BP was low.  She does not have any other 
signs/symptoms of infection.  She was given gentle IV fluids and 
losartan was held with resolution of her symptoms.  She should 
follow up with PCP with blood pressure monitoring to determine 
when to resume losartan. 

3. Constipation h/o IBS
-This is likely causing/contributing to abdominal pain, which 
will only be worsened with morphine.  She was given aggressive 
PO bowel regimen without bowel movement followed by enema today. 
 She notes clear liquid bowel movement, which is suspect is the 
enema.  Stressed the important of good bowel regimen, which she 
expressed understanding to.  She refused senna due to cramping.

History of Present Illness:
Ms. ___ is a pleasant ___ with hx of metastatic, 
recurrent
ovarian cancer presenting with diarrhea x5-6 episodes today and
abdominal pain. Pt had diarrhea 6 days ago and went to an 
outside
hospital where she had IVF with relief. Pt then did not have a 
BM
for 3 days and took miralax, colase, ducolax, followed by more
miralax. Today she had non-bloody diarrhea and cramping lower 
abd
pain. Denies N/V, dysuria, fevers, back pain.

In the ed, she was noted to have bilateral lower abd tenderness.
She received 2 mg Morphine, followed by 4 rounds of 4 mg 
morphine
over the past 24 hrs she has been in the ED. She also received 2
L NS, 4 mg zofran x 2 and 40 KCL PO. She had a CT of her abdomen
w/ contrast which revealed no acute process so she was admitted
for further management of her pain. 

Of note, she was admitted ___ for abdominal pain. On ___ 
she
underwent a diagnostic laparoscopy, lysis of adhesions, and
biopsy of a pelvic nodule with the GYN oncology team. Intraop
findings notable for diffuse peritoneal disease along left 
pelvic
side wall, thick nodular plaque-like disease on central tendon 
of
right side of diaphragm with disease coalescing centrally around
vessels, spot 2-3mm miliary disease on peritoneal surfaces and
within mesentery, malignant adhesions between small bowel to
anterior abdominal wall, small plaques of disease on surface of
bowel, left paracolic gutter nodules.

She notes that the abdominal cramps she has now is what led to
her recent diagnosis of recurrent ovarian ca. She notes that
after her surgery, her abdominal cramps slowly dissipated and
eventually resolved. However now the cramps have been recurrent
and progressive. She has cramps continuously, in her lower
quadrants, at best ___, at worst ___ which she is in now.
Nausea hasn't been too much of a problem until she started 
taking
chemotherapy again and now she has depressed appetite. Pain is
ameliorated with morphine, ibuprofen, apap, passing gas and
defecation. She recently went 3 days w/o moving bowels and took
miralax, colace and then had ___ liquid stools yesterday. Today
she had one hard bowel movement. 

She notes she has had IBS in the past, mainly diarrhea. She 
can't
tell if her current cramping is similar but she took immodium in
the past for the ibs w/ good relief.

IMAGING:
Diagnostic Lap ___
On exploratory laparoscopy, we identified
adhesions of the small bowel to the anterior abdominal wall
by the umbilicus.  No other significant adhesions were
identified within the abdomen or pelvis.  Within the pelvis,
there were some adhesions of the rectosigmoid to the left
pelvic sidewall and that pelvic side wall was covered with
what appeared to be cancer that had spread from essentially
the vaginal cuff up to the pelvic brim and then up into the
left paracolic gutter.  There was thick nodular plaque-like
disease on the central tendon on the right side of the
diaphragm.  The lateral side of the diaphragm was clear, but
this disease appeared to coalesce centrally around the
vessels.  We also identified areas of spot miliary disease on
the peritoneal surfaces and within the mesentery.  All of the
spot miliary disease nodules were on the order of 2-3 mm in
size.  The adhesions of the small bowel to the anterior
abdominal wall by the umbilicus appeared to be malignant
adhesions.  There were several small plaques of disease on
the surface of the bowel and we dissected these adhesions
free around the umbilicus.  We removed a nodule from the left
paracolic gutter.

CT Abd/Pelv w/ Con ___: PRELIM read
1. No acute process in the abdomen or pelvis. 
2. Stable appearance of right subdiaphragmatic nodularity, which
may represent metastatic disease.  Recommend continued attention
on followup.  Unchanged appearance of left pelvic sidewall soft
tissue mass.  No evidence of short interval disease progression. 

  
RECOMMENDATION(S): 
Stable appearance of right subdiaphragmatic nodularity, which 
may
represent metastatic disease.  Recommend continued attention on
followup. 

LIVER OR GALLBLADDER US (SINGLE ORGAN) Study Date of ___ 
No cholelithiasis.

 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ w/ recently diagnosed recurrent metastatic high grade serous 
ovarian carcinoma w/ diffuse peritoneal disease (initially Stage 
IIc s/p total abdominal hysterectomy, b/l salpingo-oophorectomy,
pelvic and paraaortic lymph node dissection, and omentectomy in 
___, who presents with chronic crampy abdominal pain 
without acute findings as well as alternating constipation and 
diarrhea in the setting of pain and constipation medication 
management. She had port placed for planned outpt chemotherapy 
while in house. 

# Abdominal Pain
Etiology is most likely due to extensive peritoneal malignant 
disease. As noted on her diagnostic lap on ___, she has 
"diffuse peritoneal disease, especially in the right upper 
quadrant, diaphragm with central tendon bulky disease, small 
bowel disease with adhesions to the umbilical area, left lower 
quadrant disease diffuse with adhesions of the large bowel to 
the pelvic sidewall." Admission CT did not reveal any acute 
process. By history, her pain is concurrent w/ her diagnosis of 
ovarian ca and has no provoking factors and constantly present, 
suggestive of disease related pain. She has had no acute change 
in the quality of her pain. She is moving gas and stool. RUQ U/S 
showed No cholelithiasis. Discussed with gyn/onc; no further 
role for surgery at this time. 
She was given bentyl PRN cramps and continued amitriptyline qhs, 
supportive pain control w/ po morphine, apap, avoid IV meds for 
dispo pending, and started on fentanyl patch 12 for longer 
duration of coverage. continued colace/senna, PRN milk of mag 
for constipation. regular diet tolerated well throughout 
admission.  will follow up with outpatient onc, likely plan 
continuing chemotherapy as outpatient now that she is s/p PICC 
placement with ___. 

# Ovarian Cancer, Metastatic, Recurrent
She is now on C1D12 of carboplatin every 3 weeks. She will be 
due for C2 on ___.
Dr. ___ updated, will f/u outpatient. 
discussed with gyn/onc; will discontinue estrogen for 
optimization of response to chemo.  Now s/p port placement ___ 
while patient inpatient. discharged after port for further 
outpatient care. Continued pain management and bowel regimen as 
above.

CXR
FINDINGS:
 
PA and lateral views of the chest were provided.  A right chest 
wall
Port-A-Cath is again noted with its tip extending into the low 
SVC region. 
The lungs are clear without signs of pneumonia or CHF.  No 
pleural effusion or
pneumothorax is seen.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is 
normal.  The bony
structures are intact.  No free air below the right 
hemidiaphragm is seen.  
 
IMPRESSION:
 
No evidence of pneumonia. 
 
Brief Hospital Course:
the patient was admitted to the hospital for thrombocytopenia 
and for management of her generalized fatigue and malaise. Her 
platelet count improved from 8 to ~40 after transfusion and 
remained stable. Her platelet count has been decreasing steadily 
since her last chemotherapy and is most likely due to 
chemotherapy related myelosuppression. Regarding her fatigue and 
malaise, the patient has been seen numerous times for this 
problem in the outpatient clinic, ED, and inpatient setting. She 
continues to complain of feeling unwell and routinely asks that 
she be allowed to stay another day in the hospital. She reports 
fear that she will go home and not be able to control her 
symptoms. She usually reports feeling a bit better after IV 
hydration, but generally there have been no objective signs of 
dehydration or hypovolemia. She also seems to develop additional 
symptoms when the possibility of discharge is mentioned. I had a 
long talk with ___ on this admission that while I don't doubt 
that she has symptoms, many of them do not require hospital 
admission for workup or treatment. On the day prior to discharge 
she reported a sinus headache for which she was given sudafed, 
loratidine, flonase. She reported only slight improvement with 
these and feels that she is not ready to leave the hospital 
because of sinus pain. She has been taking morphine for this 
while here and says she has been using oxycodone at home "to 
sleep" when she is uncomfortable. I explained to her that these 
medications have high addiction potential and should only be 
used for specific pain that is not controlled with tylenol or 
other NSAIDs. She agrees to be more careful about only using 
pain medications for pain, and not to help her sleep. 
I explained to ___ that it is normal to feel worn out after 
the chemo that she has had, and that it may take many weeks for 
her body to recover, and that she only needs to be in the 
hospital when there is some danger to her body. she says she 
feels "terrible" and no one understands what she is going 
through. She will continue to follow in the outpatient clinic 
for help with symptom management until she is feeling better. 
I also spoke with ___ mother ___, who is wondering why 
___ is not better able to tolerate minor symptoms at home and 
why she becomes so concerned about non-life threatening symptoms 
that she insists on coming to the ER. We will continue to work 
on reinforcing to ___ that what she is feeling is normal after 
everything she has been through, that many of her symptoms don't 
require ER or hospital evaluation, and that it will get better 
with time.

Brief Hospital Course:
___ yo female with a history of ovarian cancer who is admitted 
with generalized weakness and fatigue.

#Weakness: Generalized, with no focal neurologic findings. Able 
to ambulate independently on her own, so physical therapy signed 
off, cleared her to go home without services. Likely secondary 
to recent chemotherapy and ongoing ovarian cancer. Received IVF 
for additional hydration. B12 was within normal limits and 
vitamin D level was low so she was recommended to take a higher 
dose of Vitamin D going forward. TSH was checked and was 
high-normal/minimally elevated at 4.6. No acute need for 
levothyroxine dose adjustment but TFTs should be repeated as an 
outpatient to continue to monitor.

# Ovarian Cancer
- Received C2 carboplatin on ___. Additional chemotherapy 
planned as an outpatient on upcoming ___
- Continue home omeprazole, vitamin D, losartan, Zofran, 
loratidine, and Compazine.

# Pancytopenia: likely secondary to chemotherapy
-patient had overall lower blood counts in all three lineages 
compared to pre-chemotherapy but expected to have some bone 
marrow suppression afterwards. Not neutropenic with ANC of 1810.
- no acute need for blood product transfusions at this time. 
Continue to monitor. She should have repeat labs done as an 
outpatient prior to her next planned chemotherapy on ___. 

# Depression/Anxiety
- Continue home amitriptyline, aripiprazole, duloxetine, and 
lorazepam.
- High ER/hospital utilization partly attributable to increased 
anxiety. continue therapy and counseling as an outpatient.

# Hypothyroidism
- Continue home synthroid. As above, TSH was 
high-normal/minimally elevated at 4.6. No acute need for 
levothyroxine dose adjustment but TFTs should be repeated as an 
outpatient to continue to monitor.

was normal and you maintained normal blood pressure with 
positional changes. Your fatigue is likely related to recent 
chemotherapy and your cancer. Your blood count was stable, 
slightly lower than prior to chemotherapy but that is expected, 
and not at a level where you would need blood transfusions.

Sincerely,

FINDINGS:  The lung volumes are normal.  No pleural effusions.

UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
___ year old woman postop day #1 with persistent tachycardia, 
pleuritic chest pain
COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
FINDINGS:
There is no evidence of pulmonary embolism to the subsegmental 
level bilaterally.  The thoracic aorta is unremarkable.  The 
heart is grossly normal.  There is no pericardial effusion.  No 
pathologically enlarged mediastinal, hilar, or axillary lymph 
nodes are seen.
There are small bilateral non hemorrhagic pleural effusions, 
left slightly greater than right.  There is also subsegmental 
bilateral lower lobe atelectasis.  The lungs are otherwise 
clear.  The tracheobronchial tree is patent to the segmental 
level bilaterally. 
This study was not optimized for evaluation of the 
subdiaphragmatic contents.  Limited assessment of the upper 
abdomen demonstrates small volume pneumoperitoneum, not 
unexpected given recent surgery.  There is also minimal ascites 
in the perihepatic region.  
Bone window:  No suspicious lytic or blastic lesions are 
identified.
IMPRESSION:
1. Small bilateral non hemorrhagic pleural effusions.
2. No evidence of pulmonary embolism to the subsegmental level 
bilaterally.
3. Minimal pneumoperitoneum, not unexpected given recent 
surgery.  Small volume ascites, nonspecific in nature but likely 
related to recent surgery. 
 
Brief Hospital Course:
This patient was admitted to the gynecology oncology service 
following staging surgery for ovarian cancer. Please refer to 
the operative report for details of the surgery.  

Her post-operative course is outlined as follows. Immediately 
post-operatively, her pain was controlled with an epidural. She 
continued to have incisional discomfort and was followed by the 
Acute Pain Service; her pain regimen included a Dilaudid PCA, 
tylenol, gabapentin, and Toradol. The epidural was removed on 
postoperative day #2 and her other pain medications were 
transitioned to oral Percocet and ibuprofen.

In the PACU she was noted to have tachycardia to 130 bpm with 
normal blood pressures and oxygen saturation. EKG showed sinus 
tachycardia and she did not have any concerning anemia. Her 
heart rate decreased to 110 bpm on postoperative day #1 but she 
complained of chest discomfort. EKG again demonstrated sinus 
tachycardia. Troponins were negative. Chest xray and CTA chest 
demonstrated no evidence of cardiopulmonary process. The chest 
discomfort and tachycardia completely resolved on postoperative 
day #2 and did not recur. 

On the early morning of postoperative day #1 she developed a 
fever of 101.8F. Symptoms, physical examination, chest xray, and 
urine culture were all unrevealing and she defervesced 
spontaneously. She remained afebrile for the remainder of her 
hospitalization without evidence of infection.

She was given sips on postoperative day #1 and was then 
transitioned to clear liquids. She had some mild abdominal 
distention and discomfort but no nausea. She continued on clear 
liquids until postoperative day #4 when she experienced both 
flatus and a bowel movement. Her diet was advanced and she 
tolerated a regular diet without nausea. Her urine output was 
always adequate in the postoperative period. Her Foley catheter 
was removed following removal of the epidural and she voided 
spontaneously. 

For her cancer, she was seen by Dr ___ in 
consultation and plans were made to continue medical oncology 
visits postoperatively. She was followed by the inpatient social 
work team. She was continued on her home medications for 
depression.

By post-operative day #5, she was tolerating a regular diet, 
voiding spontaneously, ambulating independently, and pain was 
controlled with oral medications. She was then discharged home 
in stable condition with outpatient follow-up scheduled.

Brief Hospital Course:
Patient Summary:
=======================
Ms. ___ is a ___ year-old lady with a history of 
metastatic
ovarian cancer on C3 of carboplatin recently admitted for
abdominal pain ___ who presents with weakness and abdominal
pain and found to have anemia in ED. Anemia likely dilutional as 
hgb increased from 5.5- 9.1 with 1U PRBC. Abdominal pain in the 
setting of constipation and non-compliance with home bowel 
regimen. Opiate medications avoided during admission and pain 
treated with Tylenol/Naproxen. Patient had multiple bowel 
movements on day of discharge. 

#Abdominal pain: Fluctuating pain in the setting of 
non-compliance with home bowel medications. Discussed with 
outpatient provider regarding abdominal pain and preference to 
manage without opiate medications as her
pain is related to constipation and unlikely underlying
malignancy. Pain well managed with Tylenol and Naproxen. Bowel 
regimen increased from home regimen with Mgcitrate x2, miralax, 
and lactulose. Had loose BM on day of discharge. Discussed 
importance of taking bowel regimen at home to have 2 small soft 
BM daily. 

#Anemia: Acute without source of bleed. Likely dilutional in 
setting
of recent outpatient IVF as hgb increased to 9 from 5.5 after 1u 
PRBC. No
evidence of GI bleed given constipation. Hemolysis unlikely with
normal haptoglobin. H/H stable and 9.1 on discharge. 

#Weakness: Feels less week after the transfusion though 
generalized feeling of fatigue likely from protracted 
chemotherapy side effect vs. cancer related weakness/fatigue. 
Neuro exam non-focal. Ambulating well without ___. 

#Thrombocytopenia: Likely ___ chemotherapy. Did not require 
transfusion.

#Chest pain: Brief chest pain post-transfusion. EKG non-ischemic
with negative troponins and normal CXR. Remained asymptomatic 
during rest of hospitalization 

#Depression: Continued on duloxetine, amitryptiline, 
aripiprazole

#HTN: continued losartan

#Hypothyroidism: Continued levothyroxine

Transitional Issues:
========================
- Please avoid narcotic medications for pain as it likely causes 
constipation and abdominal pain
- Patient with consecutive admissions for abdominal pain related 
to constipation. Please ensure she is having 2 regular BM daily 
and increase bowel regimen as needed

CT abd/pelvis ___
IMPRESSION:
1. Extensive colonic fecal loading without evidence of acute 
infectious or
inflammatory abdominal or pelvic process.
2. Two simple fluid collections at the site of prior lymph node 
dissection in the retroperitoneal and left pelvic sidewall 
stations.  These may represent postoperative seromas or 
lymphoceles, however given the patient's history of cystic 
malignancy, close oncologic imaging follow up is recommended.

 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ year old female with a history of ovarian cancer presenting 
with abdominal pain. She was found to have a large amount of 
fecal loading on CT scan with history of IBS and opiate 
sensitive constipation. Her constipation is likely exacerbated 
by ondansetron and home oxycodone. Given methylnaltrexone and 
lactulose in the ED. After admission she was given a bowel 
regimen comprising Miralax, lactulose, senna, colace PO and PR, 
Fleet's enema. She had up to 5 loose bowel movements daily on 
this regimen but continued to complain of feeling fullness. 
There was some concern that she may have overflow diarrhea so a 
rectal exam was performed that showed no stool in the vault. Her 
bowel regimen also resulted in some anal skin tenderness which 
was relieved with barrier cream. Her CT scan also showed some 
fluid collections in the area of her surgery. While these could 
represent post op seroma, follow-up imaging was suggested given 
her history of ovarian cancer. She was discharged home in good 
condition with instructions to tailor her bowel regimen such 
that she has at least 1 bowel movement per day.

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted to the hospital with abdominal pain. You had a 
CT scan which did not show any major problems but did show 
significant constipation, which is the likely cause of your 
discomfort. The constipation is due to a combination of your 
pain medications and antinausea medicines given with chemo. You 
had an aggressive bowel regimen here consisting of senna, 
colace, miralax, lactulose, dulcolax, and Fleet's enemas. With 
this you had multiple bowel movements. You should continue to 
use these medications such that you have at least one bowel 
movement daily.

___ constipation. 

ACUTE/ACTIVE PROBLEMS:
#Abdominal Pain
#Constipation
No bowel movement since ___. Reports intermittent compliance 
with bowel regimen since discharge, which is most likely 
precipitant in addition to tramadol. Patient was nontoxic 
appearing, with a KUB showing moderate stool burden but no 
evidence of obstruction. Her abdomen was soft, without 
peritoneal signs. We gave the patient a fleet enema which 
produced a large bowel movement. This improved the patients 
symptoms and she was able to be discharged with a bowel regimen 
of senna/miralax/bisacodyl/docusate. 
Risk factor is use of tramadol, which she was started on last 
admission. Was held while in house to facilitate BM, and despite 
holding her pain improved. Resumed on discharge but could 
consider downtitrating if constipation continues.

#Recurrent Ovarian Cancer

additional vague sub cm hypodensity within the liver dome, not
clearly appreciated on the prior CT.  As suggested previously,
further assessment with MRI is recommended. 
 
Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ is a ___ yo woman with a history of stage IIc 
ovarian cancer status post total abdominal hysterectomy, 
bilateral salpingo-oopherectomy, pelvic and ___ lymph 
node dissection, and omentectomy in ___ followed by 
chemotherapy, admitted to the medicine service on ___ with 
abdominal pain.  

Ms. ___ presented with progressive symptoms including 
bloating, pain, early satiety, fatigue, and weight loss over 
past 5 months. She also had biochemical and radiographic 
findings raising high index of suspicion for ovarian cancer 
recurrence. Therefore, the GYN oncology team was consulted to 
consider cytoreductive surgery vs. surgical assessment with 
laparoscopy/biopsy for confirmation of recurrence.

On ___, Ms. ___ underwent a diagnostic laparoscopy, 
lysis of adhesions, and biopsy of a pelvic nodule with the GYN 
oncology team. Please see the operative report for full details. 
She was then transferred from the medicine service to the GYN 
oncology service for post-operative care.

Her post-operative course is detailed as follows. Immediately 
postoperatively, her pain was controlled with IV 
Morphine/acetaminophen. Her diet was advanced without difficulty 
and she was transitioned to PO morphine/acetaminophen/ibuprofen. 
On post-operative day #1, her urine output was adequate so her 
Foley catheter was removed and she voided spontaneously. 

On post-operative day #1, she developed some chest discomfort. 
She had an EKG done that showed normal sinus rhythm, and chest 
discomfort resolved. It was thought to be anxiety-related. She 
also developed diarrhea, and her bowel regimen was discontinued 
with improvement. She had a negative c. diff stool culture.

By post-operative day #2, she was tolerating a regular diet, 
voiding spontaneously, ambulating independently, and pain was 
controlled with oral medications. She was then discharged home 
in stable condition with outpatient follow-up scheduled.

CT abdomen ___
FINDINGS:
 
CT ABDOMEN:  The bases of the lungs are clear.  The liver 
enhances
homogeneously with no evidence of focal lesions.  There is no 
intra or
extrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation.  The portal vein is 
patent.  The
gallbladder is unremarkable.  The pancreas, spleen, bilateral 
adrenal glands,
and bilateral kidneys are normal in appearance.  The 
intra-abdominal
vasculature is unremarkable with a widely patent celiac axis, 
superior
mesenteric and inferior mesenteric artery.  The aorta is of 
normal caliber
throughout.  
 
Multiple surgical clips are identified throughout the 
retroperitoneum, from
prior lymph node dissection.  Additionally, midline abdominal 
scar is seen in
the subcutaneous soft tissues.  Just below the level of the 
aortic
bifurcation, there is redemonstration of a well-circumscribed 
low-density
fluid collection (2:49), measuring 1.1 x 0.9 cm, previously 
measuring 1.4 x
1.2 cm, slightly decreased in size since the prior study.  The 
intra-abdominal
loops of small and large bowel are unremarkable, normal in 
caliber and contour
with no evidence of obstruction.  The colon is filled with a 
moderate amount
of stool throughout.  No intraperitoneal free air or free fluid 
is identified.
There is fecalization of some loops of distal ileum, likely due 
to stasis with
no evidence of obstruction. 
 
CT PELVIS:  The uterus and bilateral ovaries are surgically 
absent.  The
bladder is distended, and unremarkable.  The rectum and sigmoid 
colon are
filled with stool and are not normal in appearance.  There is a 
left pelvic
sidewall low-density fluid collection which measures 3.1 x 2.4 
cm (2:65),
previously measuring 3.0 x 2.7 cm .  No pelvic free fluid is 
identified.
 
OSSEOUS STRUCTURES:  No lytic or blastic lesions suspicious for 
malignancy is
present.
 
IMPRESSION:
 
1. No acute pathology in the abdomen or pelvis.
 
2. Moderate fecal loading throughout the colon.
 
3. Redemonstration of 2 simple fluid collections in the 
retroperitoneum and
left pelvic sidewall at the site of prior lymph node dissection, 
slightly
smaller compared to prior CT from ___, possibly 
representing
postoperative seromas or lymphoceles.  
 
Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted for abdominal pain. CT abdomen showed 
no acute findings. Her bowel regimen was changed as follows: 
lactulose and docusate were stopped, dulcolax was made PRN, 
miralax was increased, and a new medication, Linzess 
(linaclotide) was added. The new medication is not available 
here readily but was called into her pharmacy. She will pick it 
up and start after discharge. She will continue on miralax for 
now but eventually can try to decrease to linaclotide 
monotherapy. 
She had leukocytosis on this admission which may be related to 
Neulasta treatment. She had no sign of infection. She will 
follow up in clinic for further care of her ovarian cancer.

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted for an allergic reaction to chemotherapy, 
specifically paclitaxel (also known as TAXOL). You were given 
steroids and other anti-allergy medications (benadryl, 
famotidine) and pain medications to help with this reaction. 
This essentially has resolved and you have recovered from these 
allergic reaction. You do have some mild chest pain that is 
slowly recovering and you will get better from this. The chest 
pain likely is due to hyperventilation and associated muscle 
pain. You did not have a blood in the lung nor a heart attack as 
these were ruled out by imaging and blood test studies. You did 
have some constipation that we gave you medication to treat. You 
should continue to use a bowel regimen (stool softeners, gentle 
laxatives and liquid laxatives) to help maintain bowel 
movements. You had sensations of feeling hot. This may be 
related to your recent operation where your ovaries were 
removed. This may cause a menopause type reaction. You should 
discuss with your doctors what ___ might take to help with hot 
flashes. You platelet level is a bit lower than normal, as 
discussed with you. You take several medications, like 
hydroxychlorquine, which may depress the production of 
platelets. You may need to discuss this with your outpatient 
doctors about which ___ are still needed during this 
time of cancer treatment. 

You will discuss with your primary oncologist, Dr. ___ 
___, about the next steps of your cancer care. She will be 
meeting with you soon.

History of Present Illness:
Ms. ___ is a ___ female history of ovarian
cancer on oral chemotherapy status post total hysterectomy, 
GERD,
anxiety, and depression here with her fourth ER visit in the 
past
48 hours with concerns of sharp lower abdominal pain that is
intermittent and never goes away. Patient was in her normal 
state
of health 4 days ago and has been evaluated by the ___ emergency department twice, where she had a CT scan 
that
only showed a small hiatal hernia and normal labs. 

She presented to the emergency department here last night into
this early this morning for the same and had a reassuring exam
and ultimately was discharged home. She comes today with
persistent sharp and severe abdominal pain that is somewhat 
worse
than before and located below her umbilicus. She has some mild
nausea and poor p.o. intake however no vomiting. No fevers or
chills. She had some episodes of diarrhea 2 days ago and per the
outside records had a negative C. difficile. She is passing gas
appropriately had a normal bowel movement yesterday. No dysuria
or hematuria. No shortness of breath or cough but she did 
develop
some pleuritic chest pain that coincides with her lower 
abdominal
pain on the floor.

MDM: ___ woman history of ovarian cancer with her fourth
ER visit in the past 48 hours for this sharp lower abdominal 
pain
of unclear etiology with a negative CT scan. On exam her vitals
are normal she appears well nontoxic her abdomen is soft without
peritonitis or other findings to suggest an acute abdomen. She
has diffuse abdominal tenderness at this time. Will obtain
baseline labs as well as provide analgesia and antiemetic
control. Patient reports that she is allergic to Dilaudid
oxycodone however can tolerate morphine. Given that this is the
patient's fourth ER visit and has an otherwise negative CT scan
within the past 24 hours and soft abdomen without any acute
findings will defer repeat cross-sectional imaging at this time.
Patient will likely benefit from inpatient admission for pain
control of unclear etiology as she has failed multiple attempts
at outpatient management.

ROS: Pertinent positives and negatives as noted in the HPI.  All
other systems were reviewed and are negative.

Brief Hospital Course:
SUMMARY: 
Ms. ___ is a ___ woman with a history of ovarian 
cancer (on oral chemotherapy) s/p TAH/BSO, depression/anxiety, 
IBS, GERD, and developmental delay attributed to childhood viral 
encephalitis who presented with acute periumbilical, constant 
abdominal pain associated with mild nausea and anorexia and was 
admitted with an unremarkable workup after 4 visits to the ED in 
___Y PROBLEM:

# Periumbilical/lower abdominal pain
The etiology of the initial abdominal pain that brought the 
patient to ___ is unclear.  She had a normal 
work-up including labs and CT A/P with contrast at ___.  
The differential included functional abdominal pain vs. 
interstitial cystitis (as there is some association with 
urination) vs. constipation.  After presenting to the ___ ED x 
2, the patient was admitted for further work-up.  She was given 
morphine for pain control.  An abdominal XR subsequently showed 
colonic ileus, which, while not thought the be the cause of the 
original presentation, may have been the cause for the 
persistent abdominal pain.  She was subsequently treated with 
bowel rest, IV fluids, and a fleet enema.  She improved with 
these interventions. She had a BM and was able to tolerate a 
regular diet prior to discharge.  She was counseled on avoiding 
narcotic pain medications if possible. 

CHRONIC/STABLE PROBLEMS:
# Recurrent Ovarian Cancer
Patient of Dr. ___. Previously on carboplatin now on oral chemo 
(NF) which pt brought in.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,
You were admitted to the hospital for abdominal pain.  While the 
cause of your initial abdominal pain is uncertain, we suspect 
you developed an ileus (reduced bowel motility) in the setting 
of morphine use.  This ileus resolved with increased ambulation, 
an enema, and bowel rest.  It is very important that you 
continue to take miralax and Colace to ensure regular bowel 
movements.  If possible, avoid narcotic pain medications such as 
morphine due to side-effects of constipation and possibility of 
ileus.

You should follow up with your outpatient providers as detailed 
below and continue to take your medications as directed.  Please 
have your kidney function checked in 1 week.

Best wishes for your continued healing.
Take care,
Your ___ Care Team

___ BLE US
Negative for DVT
 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ is a ___ year old woman with a history of 
ovarian cancer, IBS, and depression who presented with abdominal 
pain. 

#ABDOMINAL PAIN: 
Felt to be secondary to cancer and worsening constipation. 
Abdominal imaging showed no acute process. We discovered that 
often during the week the patient does not take her bowel 
regimen because she is worried about having diarrhea at work. We 
went over with her how important it was to take her bowel 
regimen regularly to prevent constipation and abdominal pain 
this severe. We gave her an aggressive bowel regimen that 
included enemas and lactulose and after a few days she finally 
had a few bowel movements. Ultimately, no major changes to her 
pain regimen were made (morphine was tried but did not make a 
notable difference), other than adding gabapentin given that a 
large component of her abdominal pain was thought to be from 
abdominal hypersensitivity and related to her IBS. 

#DRY MOUTH: 
Stopped loratadine to minimize anticholinergic medication burden 
(was on loratadine and amitryptiline)

#LOW VITAMIN D: 
Started 50,000 IU weekly on ___ for 8 week course. Last 
day ___. Discontinued home dose of vitamin D 2,000 units 
daily. 

#LEFT LOWER RIB PAIN:
Initially concerning for metastases, though essentially r/o by 
XR. Likely secondary to splenic mass.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,

You were admitted to the hospital for abdominal pain. 

We believe that your abdominal pain was primarily caused by 
severe constipation. We gave you many medications and encouraged 
you to walk, and once you had a bowel movement you felt better.

When you go home, it is important to: 
1. Take your constipation medications every day. We absolutely 
understand that you are worried about having diarrhea, but if 
you miss these medications you ___ develop painful constipation 
like this again. 
   ***Your constipation medications that you should take every 
day are: Miralax twice a day, Colace twice a day, Psyllium once 
a day
   ***If you are taking these medications and are still 
constipated, you should use a Dulcolax suppository once a day 
until you have a bowel movement

2. Keep walking around as much as you can. The exercise is 
healthy and will help keep your bowel movements regular.
3. Please read your discharge summary below and look for 
medication changes and upcoming doctor appointments. 

It was a pleasure caring for you,
Your ___ Team

ACTIVE ISSUES
=============
# Chest pain, from
# Costochondritis: etiology unclear, may be related to 
carboplatin infusion. Of note, reaction to carboplatin can often 
develop after multiple treatments, though is often more 
consistent with an anaphylaxis like presentation. Patient denied 
any pruritis, difficulty breathing or urticarial/rash. CTA 
negative for PE. Troponin negative x3 and EKG non-ischemic. Exam 
notable for reproducible sternal chest pain, most consistent 
with costochondritis. Started on naproxen, with improvement. 
Plan to continue naproxen 500 mg BID x7 days. 

# Recurrent, platinum sensitive ovarian cancer: platinum 
chemotherapy currently on hold. Will need to address platinum 
re-challenge in outpatient follow-up. 

# Leukocytosis: isolated on day of discharge, without any other 
localizing signs of infection.
- Recommend repeat CBC within 1 week 

CHRONIC ISSUES
