History of Present Illness:
Ms. ___ is a ___ year old right-handed woman with no significant 
past medical history who last night around 8pm while she was at 
work began feeling dizzy and nauseous, and per a co-worker was 
"walking sideways" and almost fell.  She felt better when 
sitting down, but every time she stood back up her
symptoms would return.  She also had a severe headache.  She 
went to ___, and was discharged from the 
ED after a head CT was done.  This morning she felt worse and 
went back to the ED, where the original CT was re-read as having 
a posterior fossa hyperdensity along the left lateral aspect of 
the midbrain. A CTA was done that reportedly showed no stenosis 
or
occlusion.  She was transferred to ___ for further management. 


The patient states that since this morning she has felt numbness 
in her right arm and leg.  This morning her right face also felt 
numb, although this has since resolved.  She thinks her right 
leg is a little weaker as well.  She states she has been having 
headaches for the past 2 months that are at times severe and 
that she treats by taking ___ aspirin (600mg) at a time.  These 
occur in the evening and have been happening nearly daily 
according to
her boyfriend.  She has been trying to decrease her use of 
aspirin, and thinks she may have had ___ over this past week.  
She denies any visual symptoms, other paresthesias or weakness, 
tinnitus or hearing problems.  Last night she felt that sounds 
were abnormally distant sounding but this has since resolved. 
She hasn't been able to drink or eat over the past 2 days due to 
the nausea and vomiting.

Pertinent Results:
___ Cerebral Angiogram
This diagnostic cerebral angiography confirmed the presence of a 
left superior cerebellar artery spontaneous dissection, which 
including its second (ambient segment) and first half of the 
second (quadrigeminal segment). This is the long dissection 
along the superior cerebellar artery and The length of 
dissection was measured about 2.5 cm, without focal aneurysmal 
formation. We will discuss with the patient regarding different 
treatment strategies. 

___ CTA head:
Ectasia of the perimesencephalic portion of left superior 
cerebellar artery without appreciable intraluminal filling 
defect, unchanged from recent cerebral angiogram.

CEREBRAL/RECHECK ___ 
This diagnostic cerebral angiography showed a stable size and 
appearance of previously known left superior cerebellar artery 
dissection.  No 
thromboembolic complication is noted in this diagnostic 
cerebellar 
angiography.  No other vascular abnormality was detected. ___ 
was consulted for dispo planning. 

___ MRI head w/ & w/o contrast
Partially thrombosed dissecting left superior cerebellar artery 
aneurysm which 
indents the adjacent midbrain-pontine junction, resulting in 
mass effect and a 
small amount of fluid signal seen within this region.

Pertinent Results:
___ - Cerebral Angiogram:
Ms. ___ was taken to the angiography to perform a 
two-month post-left cerebellar artery dissection check 
angiography. This 
angiography confirmed that the angiographic picture of that left 
SCA 
dissection has got worse and we see more dissecting aneurysmal 
formation and dilatation of the entire segment in comparison to 
the previous angiography, which was performed on ___. Otherwise, there is no other vascular abnormality. No 
procedure-related thromboembolic complication was noted. 

___ - Interventional Procedure:
Preliminary Report
1. Successful primary embolization of a left SCA dissecting 
fusiform aneurysm with deployment of multiple coils within the 
aneurysm sac itself. Final post embolization angiograms 
demonstrates patency and filling of the proximal left SCA which 
likely contribute significant brainstem perforators. 
2. No direct thromboembolic complication was noted from this 
procedure. 

___ CT head without contrast:
1. Limited evaluation due to beam hardening artifact due to left 
SCA coil 
mass. 
2. Within limits of study, no acute intracranial abnormality. 

___ MRI/MRA head
Small acute infarcts are seen involving the left side of the 
pons and left 
superior cerebellum.  The MRA examination is unchanged from the 
previous study 
of ___. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. ___ was admitted to the Neurosurgery service on ___ after 
she underwent an elective cerebral angiogram to further evaluate 
her known left superior cerebellar artery disection.  After the 
procedure, she was transferred to the ICU for close neurologic 
monitoring and strict blood pressure control, keeping her 
systolic pressure less than 140mmHg.  The patient and family 
were extremely upset and anxious due to the increase in size and 
overall severity of the disection.  The patient was given a diet 
as tolerated.  Emotional support was provided to the patient and 
family, and risks and benefits of a surgical intervention this 
admission were discussed.

On ___, the patient remained neurologically stable. Dr. ___ 
met with the patient and family in the afternoon. It was decided 
after in depth discussion regarding risks and benefits with the 
patient , her parents and significant other to proceed with 
endovascular treatment of aneurysm.

On ___, the patient was brought to the INR site and under 
general anesthesia the Left SCA dissecting aneurysm was 
successful coil embolized. She was extubated, neurologically 
intact and transferred back to the neuro ICU in stable 
condition. A heparin drip was initiated and she was closely 
monitored overnight.

On ___, the patient remained neurologically stable. The 
pressors were weaned off and it was determined she would be kept 
normotensive. The foley catheter was discontinued. 

On ___, Mrs. ___ was transferred to the inpatient ward for 
further management.  Her IV fluids and pressors were 
discontinued.  She was maintaining a systolic pressure in the 
95-115 range.  She was encourged to ambulate and mobilize out of 
bed with nursing assistance.  The patients WBC increased from 12 
to 20 on this day.  

On ___, the patient was started on 5 days of cipro for a UTI. 
 She was neurologically stable. She worked with ___.
