CXR:  PA and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There is 
a small 
right pleural effusion, best assessed on the lateral view.  A 
tiny left 
pleural effusion cannot be excluded.  Heart size appears top 
normal.  The 
aorta is unfolded.  There is mild interstitial edema without 
signs of 
pneumonia or pneumothorax.  Bony structures are intact. 
  
IMPRESSION:  Mild pulmonary interstitial edema with probable 
tiny bilateral pleural effusions. 
TTE: ___
The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall 
thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity is 
moderately dilated. There is moderate to severe global left 
ventricular hypokinesis with relative preservation of the apex 
(LVEF = ___ %). No masses or thrombi are seen in the left 
ventricle. Right ventricular chamber size is normal with mild 
global free wall hypokinesis. The aortic valve leaflets (3) 
appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no 
aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve 
appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. 
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined. 
There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Left ventricular cavity 
dilation with extensive systolic dysfunction suggestive of a 
non-ischemic cardiomyopathy.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of ___, 
the pathologic findings are new.
LHC: ___
1) Selective coronary angiography of this right-dominant system 
demonstrated moderate single-vessel branch coronary artery 
disease with 
diffuse slow flow throughout. The LMCA was long and had no 
angiographically-apparent flow-limiting stenoses. The LAD had 
mild 
luminal irregularities and a large D1 with proximal 50% 
stenosis. The 
LCx provided an atrial branch and small OM1 proximally, then a 
large 
branching OM2 that had minimal luminal irregularities; there was 
a tiny 
short AV groove LCx after the OM2 take-off. The RCA was a very 
large-caliber vessel with minimal luminal irregularities; there 
was a 
large RPDA and large long RPL2, and a modest caliber RPL1. 
2) Limited resting hemodynamics revealed mildly-elevated 
left-sided 
filling pressures with an LVEDP of 17 mmHg. There was mild 
pulmonary 
arterial hypertension, with a PA pressure of 41/21 mmHg. There 
was 
systemic arterial normotension, with a central aortic pressure 
of 116/76 
mmHg. There was no aortic valve gradient seen on careful 
pullback from 
the left ventricle to the aorta. 
3) After the procedure, a Terumo Radial band was applied to the 
right 
radial arteriotomy site with adequate hemostasis. The left 
antecubital 
venous sheath was removed and pressure was manually applied with 

adequate hemostasis. 
  
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:     
1. Moderate single-vessel branch coronary artery disease with 
diffuse 
slow flow consistent with microvascular dysfunction. 
2. Mild pulmonary arterial hypertension. 
3. Mild left ventricular diastolic dysfunction.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,

It was a pleasure taking care of you at ___.  
You were admitted because you were having shortness of breath, 
especially with exertion.  An echocardiogram was done which 
showed that your heart's pumping ability was decreased, which 
was consistent with new heart failure.  You were admitted and 
given medicine to help you pee off the excess fluid in your 
body.  Your kidney function remained stable during this process. 
You had a cardiac catheterization which showed that your 
coronary arteries were not the cause of your new heart failure.

Your medicines have been changed.  Please refer to your attached 
med list for the changes. Please follow-up at the appointments 
listed below.

Weigh yourself every morning, call MD if weight goes up more 
than 3 lbs.  Your weight at discharge was 152 kg or about 335 
lbs.

History of Present Illness:
This is a ___ y/o F with h/o DMT2 and idiopathic systolic CHF 
presenting from ___ with dizziness, fatigue, hyperglycemia, 
and hypotension at clinic. Went to ___ for routine 
appointment where BG found to be >500 with SBPs ___. Patient 
reports 1 day of fatigue and not taking her insulin. She reports 
that she has been eating and drinking normally. She denies 
polyuria or polydipsia. She had a left groin abscess drained at 
an OSH 3 days ago but reports no further drainage or pain around 
the site. No cough, shortness of breath, orthopnea, chest pain, 
abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, dysuria, or headache. She has 
chronic diarrhea, which is not worse than baseline.  
 In the ED, initial vs were: 96.0 80 87/55 22 95% RA. On arrival 
to the ED, she had a blood sugar greater than 600 but with no 
DKA on labs (no gap, Bicarb ok, urine without ketones). She was 
initially started on an insulin drip at 9 units per hour and 
then when the labs came back without evidence of DKA she was 
given 50U insulin SQ. However, her next blood sugar check went 
back up greater than 300 so she was restarted on an insulin drip 
at 10 units and overlapped with her home dose of SQ insulin, 
which is 150 units of U500. For the presenting hypotension, she 
also received 4L of NS and 500 cc of LR while in the ED and her 
blood pressure improved to 105/62 before transfer. Was given 60 
mEq of PO potassium repletion for a K of 3.0. She arrived on the 
floor with an additional liter of NS with 40 mEq potssium mixed 
in. Was also given Magnesium 2 gm IV and neutraphos 2 packets in 
the ED. Blood sugar on transfer was 280.  
 She did have several measurements of a lactate 3.4-3.9, which 
did not improve with hydration and hyperglycemia management 
above. Because of this, she was given vancomycin and unasyn to 
cover for a polymicrobial infection in the known groin abscess.

Brief Hospital Course:
___ yo F with h/o poorly controlled T2DM and non-ischemic 
cardiomyopathy who presented from clinic with hypotension and 
elevated blood glucose, found to have been noncompliant with 
insulin.

ACTIVE DIAGNOSES:
  
# Type II Diabetes Mellitus: The patient presented from ___ 
appointment where her sugar was found to be above 600. She 
admitted to skipping a few doses of insulin prior to her 
appointment. She notes forgetting about 1 in 4 doses of insulin 
routinely, sometimes due to leaving the house without her 
insulin. Her labs did not show DKA, however, her blood glucose 
was so high that she required an insulin drip in the ED to get 
better control of this. She was transitioned to subcutaneous 
insulin U500, which she requires at home. She stayed 1 night in 
the hospital and morning sugars were under much better control. 
She was given K+ repletion, in addition to aggressive IVF (see 
below). A ___ consult recommended 250 Units of insulin TID 
with meals, plus sliding scale (50 Units of U500 TID). The pt 
also met with a DM educator. The patient was discharged with 
___ and PCP ___.  
  
# Hypotension: SBP at ___ was in the ___. Her hypotension was 
likely from glucosuria. The patient was treated with 4.5L of IVF 
while in ED, then maintenance fluids overnight. She had 1 
further bout of hypotension in the morning with SBP 88 on 
standing, but pressures improved after a 500cc bolus. An 
infectious etiology was considered given hypotension and 
hyperglycemia, although she did not have any localizing 
symptoms, no leukocytosis, normal CXR, and her lactate improved 
with IVF and glucose control. Her recent I&D site appeared 
un-infected. She was continued on her usual antihypertensives. 
She should ___ with her PCP for BP control.  
  
# Acute kidney injury: Upon presentation to the ED she had an 
elevation in creatinine to 1.3, pre-renal given the hypotension 
and glucosuria. Cr improved with IVF and was 1.0 on day of 
discharge.
  
# Elevated lactate, without acidosis: There was no leukocytosis 
or fevers and her recent I&D site looked un-infected. Lactate 
elevation was thought to be secondary to hypotension discussed 
above. It trended down with IVF. 

# Recently drained mons abscess: The patient had I&D done at ___ 
___ 3 days prior to presentation. The incision 
looked uninfected. A swab of the area was done in the ED, 
however given clinical appearance, antibiotics were not 
continued.  

CHRONIC ISSUES:  
# Chronic systolic heart failure, EF 45%: Non ischemic per 
report. No signs of decompensation during hospitalization. The 
pt was continued on ASA, rosuvastatin, carvedilol, lisinopril, 
torsemide.  
# h/o NASH: Also no evidence of decompensation on exam. 
Spironolactone and torsemide were continued.  
# Obstructive sleep apnea: continued on CPAP  
# Hypothyroidism: continued on levothyroxine  
# Chronic diarrhea: continued on loperamide 

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
-Insulin dosing has been adjusted to make it easy to remember: 
50 Units of U500 (equal to 250 Units regular insulin) three 
times daily with meals, plus sliding scale.
-Encourage insulin use
-Blood cultures pending at time of discharge

Brief Hospital Course:
This is a ___ year old femal with PMHx of dilated cardiomyopathy, 
DM, ___, who presented on ___ from PCP with hypotension. 

#HYPOTENSION: Patient had recent admission for hypotension in 
the setting of hyperglycemia.  Patient's glucose on admission 
was 134 so unlikely cause.  Patient does have chronic diarrhea 
(and recent poor PO intake) which could be a contributing 
factor.  Patient is also on thyroid medications, which could 
contribute to her current state. Adrenal insufficiency could 
also contribute to hpotension. Patient had no new changes to her 
anti-hypertensives.  Her anti-hypertensives (carvedilol, 
spironolactone, torsemide, and lisinopril) were held.  Her blood 
pressure returned to normal (SBP 120s) and symptoms resolved on 
day of discharge. Orthostatic vital signs were checked and were 
normal on the day of discharge. An AM cortisol was checked (in 
setting of hypotension, hyperkalemia) and was normal at 13.1, 
making adrenal insufficiency unlikely. On discharge, her 
carvedilol and torsemide were restarted and lisinopril dose was 
decreased from 40 mg to 20 mg daily and spironolactone was held 
(given that patient's recent hypotension may be related to 
anti-hypertensives).

# ___: Upon presentation to the ED she had an elevation in 
creatinine to 1.2, pre-renal given the hypotension, chronic 
diarrhea and poor PO intake recently.  Her lisinopril and 
nephrotixic medications were held.  Medications were renally 
dosed.  She received 500 cc NS boluses prn.  Her Cr returned to 
baseline 0.9 on the day of discharge.  

#HYPERKALEMIA: Patient developed hyperkalemia to 5.5 (from 4.3) 
on HD2 which was most likely due to not receiving enough insulin 
since her home U500 had been stopped and a humalog sliding scale 
started on admission.  AM cortisol was checked and found to be 
normal at 13.1 making adrenal insufficiency unlikely.  An EKG 
was obtained and showed a LBBB in setting of tachycardia to ___ 
which patient has had in the past on stress test.  She received 
2 gm IV calcium gluconate in addition to her home dose of U500, 
kayexalate and a fluid bolus and her potassium return to normal 
(4.3) prior to discharge. 
  
# EKG changes: Patient had LBBB in setting of tachycardia on EKG 
___, has had similar LBBB with stress test in past (may be 
related to underlying cardiomyopathy). Patient also hyperkalemic 
at that time which could cause LBBB. CKMB and troponins were 
negative x3. Her hyperkalemia was treated as above.

# LACTATEMIA, without acidosis: No leukocytosis or fevers. 
Lactate elevation likely secondary to hypotension and 
dehydration.  Patient also on metformin which may contribute but 
no new changes to dosing. Patient's metformin was held and she 
received IVF 500 cc NS boluses for fluid resuscitation.

#DM Type II. Patient has poorly controlled sugars and recent 
admission for hyperglycemia. She is on U500 at home. HbA1c on 
___ was 8.3%. Patient's metformin was held and she was 
initially placed on a humalog ISS but her blood sugars remained 
elevated (>400).  A ___ consult was placed and she was 
restarted on her home dose of U500 insulin 250 units with meals. 
Her metformin was restarted and she was continued on her home 
dose of insulin on discharge.

CHRONIC ISSUES:  
# Chronic systolic heart failure, EF 45%: Non ischemic per 
report. No signs of decompensation. Patient was continued on 
ASA, rosuvastatin. Her carvedilol, lisinopril and torsemide were 
held in setting of hypotension. Carvedilol and torsemide were 
restarted at the same doses on discharge but lisinopril dose was 
decreased from 40 to 20 mg daily given recent hypotension.  

# h/o NASH: Also no evidence of decompensation on exam. 
Patient's Spironolactone and torsemide were held in setting of 
hypotension. Torsemide was restarted on discharge but 
spironolactone was held on discharge given recent hypotension. 
Restarting spironolactone should be discussed with patient 
depending on BP as an outpatient.

# Obstructive sleep apnea: Patient was continued on CPAP.

# Hypothyroidism: Patient was continued on home levothyroxine. A 
TSH was rechecked and found to be elevated at 8.9. Therefore, 
patient will likely require re-titration of levothyroxine dosing 
as an outpatient.  

# Chronic diarrhea: Patient was continued on home loperamide 
 

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
[ ] Please follow-up final urine and blood cultures from 
___
[ ] Please follow-up electrolytes (as patient had hyperkalemia 
to 5.5 on ___, which was likely related to not enough insulin)
[ ] Please recheck BP and consider restarting spironolactone and 
going back up to lisinopril 40 mg daily (from 20 mg daily) 
depending on BP. Patient's spironolactone was held and 
lisinopril dose was decreased from 40 to 20 mg daily on 
discharge given her hypotension.
[ ] Patient will require adjustment of levothyroxine dosing as 
an outpatient given TSH was measured and was found to be high at 
8.9

Brief Hospital Course:
On ___, Ms. ___ was admitted from ED for traumatic SAH 
following a syncopal fall.  Her aspirin was held.  She was 
monitored with serial neurologic examinations. Medicine was 
consulted for assistance with management and syncope workup. 
Cardiology was consulted for ICD interrogation, which was 
unremarkable.

On ___, the patient remained neurologically stable and was 
deemed to require no further neurosurgical intervention.  The 
medicine team felt that her syncope was most likely due to 
orthostasis, and orthostatic vital signs were indeed positive.  
Her anti-hypertensive medications were held.  She was fluid 
resuscitated and urinalysis was ordered.  The medicine team 
recommended that no further syncope workup was necessary.  Her 
urinalysis was positive.  Urine culture was sent and she was 
started on ciprofloxacin.

On ___, she remained neurologically stable and her vital signs 
were no longer concerning for orthostasis.  Her 
anti-hypertensive and diuretic medications were resumed.  She 
diuresed appropriately.  Her potassium was repleted.  
Fingerstick monitoring revealed blood glucose levels in the 
300s, which was covered with sliding scale insulin.  Her 
condition was discussed with the medicine team and she was 
deemed ready for discharge.  A thorough discussion was had with 
the patient regarding post-discharge instructions and 
appropriate follow-up care.  She was discharged on ciprofloxacin 
to complete a 10-day course and levetiracetam for 7 days.  She 
was instructed to closely monitor her blood glucose and provided 
with a prescription to undergo outpatient lab testing for 
electrolyte monitoring.  She will follow up with her PCP ___ 5 
days and with Dr. ___ in 3 months.
