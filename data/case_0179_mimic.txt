Results:
================
___: TTE: IMPRESSION: Moderate bileaflet mitral valve
prolapse (anterior > posterior) with severe mitral regurgitation
(4+). Moderate pulmonary hypertension. Mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with globally preserved left ventricular
systolic function (LVEF > 55%) and regional abnormalities, as 
per
above. Mildly dilated, milldy hypokinetic right ventricle.  

pCXR: ___
IMPRESSION:  
There is cardiomegaly with left ventricular prominence.  There 
is
atelectasis at the lung bases.  There is no focal consolidation. 

There are no pneumothoraces. 

pCXR ___  
IMPRESSION:  
Mildly decreased pulmonary vascular congestion. 

___: TTE: The left atrial volume index is severely 
increased. The right atrium is moderately dilated. The 
interatrial septum is aneurysmal. A left-to-right shunt across 
the interatrial septum is seen at rest. Left ventricular wall 
thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is 
normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal 
(LVEF = 60%). The right ventricular free wall is hypertrophied. 
The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with severe 
global free wall hypokinesis. There is abnormal systolic septal 
motion/position consistent with right ventricular pressure 
overload. The number of aortic valve leaflets cannot be 
determined. The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened (?#). 
There is no aortic valve stenosis. Trace aortic regurgitation is 
seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is 
mild/moderate bileaflet mitral valve prolapse. A MitraClip 
prosthesis is present. There is mild valvular mitral stenosis 
(mean pressure gradient = 9 mmHg). An eccentric, posteriorly 
directed jet of A late systolic jet of Moderate (2+) mitral 
regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity 
of mitral regurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated.] 
Due to the eccentric nature of the regurgitant jet, its severity 
may be significantly underestimated (Coanda effect). The 
tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is moderate 
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is a 
trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion. There are no 
echocardiographic signs of tamponade. 

 Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of ___, 
MitraClip repair of mitral valve now seen. Mitral regurgitation 
is reduced. Left-to-right shunt across interatrial septum now 
present.

Discharge Disposition:
Extended Care
 
Facility:
___
 
Discharge Diagnosis:
Mitral Regurgitation
Diastolic Heart Failure

 
Discharge Condition:
Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Level of Consciousness: Alert and interactive.
Activity Status: Ambulatory - requires assistance or aid (walker 
or cane).

 
Discharge Instructions:
You presented to ___ with increasing shortness of 
breath due to congestive heart failure related to your Mitral 
Valve Regurgitation (leaky valve). You were treated with IV 
diuretics and sent to ___ for a procedure to repair your 
Mitral Valve and improve the mitral regurgitation. Your 
___ procedure was done on ___.

Activity instructions and care of your right groin incision was 
provided with discharge instructions.

You also had decreased oxygen levels with shortness of breath 
concerning for possible underlying lung disease. You were 
treated with nebulizers to help open your airways to make 
breathing easier. You were seen by the Pulmonary team and they 
recommended starting an inhaler, Spiriva, as well. You should 
follow up with a pulmonary doctor following discharge from the 
hospital for further evaluation of this. 

You were not taking any medications prior to this 
hospitalization aside from your Lasix. We have started you on 
some medications that are very important to continue:
1. Aspirin 81mg daily, you should take this for life 
2. Plavix 75mg daily, this prevents clots from forming in and 
around your heart valve and you should not stop taking this 
unless specifically told by a cardiologist
3. Lisinopril 2.5mg daily, this helps with blood pressure as 
well as decreases the amount of resistance your heart has to 
pump against in order to pump blood through your body 
4. Furosemide should be continued, but your home dose should be 
determined by your rehab center providers based on your progress 

5. Metoprolol, this medication works to slow your heart rate and 
regulate the rhythm, it can also decrease blood pressure, your 
dose should be determined by your providers at the rehab center 
based on your heart rate and blood pressure during your stay  
6. Spiriva inhaler once daily as recommended by Pulmonary team   

7. Atorvastatin 40mg daily, this reduces cholesterol and helps 
decrease the risk of future heart attack 

It is very important that you follow with your Primary Care 
Doctor and Cardiologist after this admission. You will also have 
a follow up visit with the Structural Heart Team in 1 month to 
have a follow up Echo.
