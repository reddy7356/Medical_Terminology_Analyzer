infarction. Prior anteroseptal and lateral myocardial 
infarction. Right bundle-branch block. Left anterior fascicular 
block. Compared to the previous tracing of ___ no 
diagnostic interim change. 

Right lower extremity U/S ___: IMPRESSION: 
No evidence of deep vein thrombosis in the right lower 
extremity. 

CXR ___:
The patient is status post median sternotomy and CABG.  Left 
left-sided 
AICD/pacemaker device is noted with single lead terminating in 
the right 
ventricle.  Curvilinear calcification at the cardiac apex is 
again noted, and unchanged compatible with prior left 
ventricular infarct with aneurysm formation.  Low lung volumes 
are present, with the heart size appearing mildly enlarged.  The 
aorta remains calcified.  The mediastinal contours are stable.  
Innumerable bilateral diffuse nodules are seen in both lungs 
compatible with metastatic disease.  No focal consolidation, 
pleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified.  No definite 
acute osseous abnormalities are seen. 
IMPRESSION: 
Innumerable pulmonary metastases.  No radiographic evidence for 
pneumonia. 

TTE ___:
The left atrium is markedly elongated. There is mild symmetric 
left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size. There is 
moderate to severe regional left ventricular systolic 
dysfunction with severe hypo/akinesis of the distal ___ of 
the ventricle. The apex is aneurysmal and mildly dyskinetic. 
Basal segments contract best (LVEF = 25 %). The estimated 
cardiac index is normal (>=2.5L/min/m2). No masses or thrombi 
are seen in the left ventricle. The right ventricular cavity is 
mildly dilated with depressed free wall contractility. The 
ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets are 
moderately thickened. There is mild aortic valve stenosis. Trace 
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are 
mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. 
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is at least 
mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. Significant 
pulmonic regurgitation is seen. The end-diastolic pulmonic 
regurgitation velocity is increased suggesting pulmonary artery 
diastolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion. 
IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with 
extensive regional systolic dysfunction c/w multivessel CAD or 
other diffuse process. At least mild pulmonary artery 
hypertension. Mild aortic valve stenosis. Moderate tricuspid 
regurgitation. Dilated ascending aorta. 
Compared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable 
for review) of ___, left ventricular systolic function is 
similar. The tricuspid regurgitation, mitral regurgitation,

SUMMARY FROM THE EXERCISE LAB:  
  
For pharmacologic coronary vasodilatation dipyridamole was 
infused intravenously 
for 4 minutes at a dose of 0.142 milligram/kilogram/min.  
  
IMAGING METHOD:  
  
Resting perfusion images were obtained with Tc-99m sestamibi. 
Tracer was 
injected approximately 45 minutes prior to obtaining the resting 
images.  
  
Following resting images and following intravenous infusion,  
approximately 
three times the resting dose of Tc-99m sestamibi was 
administered intravenously. 
Stress images were obtained approximately 30 minutes following 
tracer 
injection.  
  
The patient experienced atypical anginal symptoms during the 
infusion. There 
were no significant ST segment changes from baseline. 
  
Imaging protocol: Gated SPECT.  
  
This study was interpreted using the 17-segment myocardial 
perfusion model.  
  
INTERPRETATION:  
  
The image quality is adequate. 
  
Left ventricular cavity size is enlarged. With an EDV of 326mL 
with stress. 
  
Rest and stress perfusion images reveal severe fixed defects in 
the inferior 
wall, mid and distal anteroseptal wall, inferoseptal wall, mid 
and distal 
anterior wall, distal lateral wall and in the apex. 
  
Gated images reveal an extensive akinetic apical region with the 
only 
functioning portion at the base of the heart. 
  
The calculated left ventricular ejection fraction is 21% with 
stress. 
  
Compared with prior planar images obtained in the study of 
___ 
there has been considerable increase in left ventricle volume. 
  
IMPRESSION:  
  
1.  Severe fixed perfusion defects in the inferior wall, mid and 
distal 
anteroseptal wall, inferoseptal wall, mid and distal anterior 
wall, distal 
lateral wall and in the apex. 
  
2.  Decreased ejection fraction with an extensive akinetic 
apical region with 
the only functioning portion at the base of the heart. 
  
3.  Enlarged left ventricular cavity, worse compared to the 
prior study from 
___. 

EKG ___
Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. Possible 
prior inferior 
myocardial infarction, age undetermined. Left axis deviation. 
Right 
bundle-branch block. Possible prior anteroseptal myocardial 
infarction, age undetermined. Compared to the previous tracing 
of ___ the findings are similar. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ yo male w/ extensive coronary history as well as multiple 
metastatic malignancies and ischemic cardiomyopathy (EF = 25%) 
presents with one day of chest tightness and ear pain similar to 
prior MI events. EKG unchanged and troponin 0.02. MIBI stress 
test demonstrating multiple fixed lesions, but no reversible 
lesions to be intervened upon.  
.  
# CAD: Pain consistent with prior ACS events; however EKG 
unchanged and troponin not dramatically elevated, especially in 
patient with CKD. Repeat troponin only mildly elevated to 
0.05->0.04. Nuclear perfusion stress test showed Severe fixed 
perfusion defects in the inferior wall, mid and distal 
anteroseptal wall, inferoseptal wall, mid and distal anterior 
wall, distal lateral wall and in the apex. Only functioning 
portion at the base of the heart. No reversible defects. 
Enlarged LV with EF = 20%, likely unchanged from TTE from ___ 
showing EF = 25%.  
Severe fixed defects, but no obvious intervenable lesions by 
stress. Enlarged LV likely unchanged from recent ECHO. Continued 
medical management with ASA 325mg, Plavix 75mg, quinapril 2.5 mg 
(decreased from 5mg due to low BPs in-house), lipitor 40mg.  
   
#Paroxysmal a-fib: Patient in a-fib throughout majority of 
admission, with occasaional spontaneous reversions to sinus 
rhythm. At rest, HR remained in mid ___ however, with minimal 
exertion, HR would increase to 100-130, and patient became 
symptomatic, stating he felt "wiped out" every time he exerted 
himself. His beta-blocking regimen on admission was carvedilol 
6.25mg BID. The decision was made to switch to metoprolol 50mg 
XL for better rate control. After making this change, patient's 
HR remained below 100 with exertion and he symptomatically 
improved: stating he was able to ambulate without feeling 
palpitations or "wiped out". He was scheduled for EP f/u for 
possible a-fib ablation in the future. Patient not 
anticoagulated beyond ASA and Plavix due to history of 
significant GI bleed.

# Chronic fatigue: likely multifactorial, ___ worsening systolic 
CHF, anemia, and multiple malignancies. patient actually states 
that fatigue seemed to improve since hospitalization. Possibly 
___ to improved rate control of his paroxysmal a-fib. . 
Outpatient heme/onc attributes his chronic anemia to likely MDS 
and anemia of chronic disease. B12 levels were checked during 
this admission and found to be on the low side of normal. 
Supplementation not started in house, but patient may benefit 
from this in the future with regards to his anemia. 

# Systolic congestive heart failure: Patient somewhat volume 
overloaded on initial presentation. No evidence of pulmonary 
edema. Was started on furosemide 10mg daily for gentle diuresis. 
JVP flat upon discharge and patient appeared relatively 
euvolemic. Was discharged on home dose of Torsemide 5 mg and 
spironolactone. 

# Cough: productive of white sputum. No leukocytosis and lungs 
sounded clear. No fevers/chills or any other evidence of PNA. 
Unlikely PNA. Would be difficult to interpret CXR in setting of 
multiple pulmonary nodules. ___ be bronchitis. Sputum cx sent 
and will require f/u with his PCP. Patient appears well, no ABx 
on discharge.  

# Right lower extremity erythema - RLE U/S showed no DVT. Right 
lower extremity with erythematous, edematous skin with very well 
demarcated, darker red borders. Atypical appearance for 
cellulitis and no response to vancomycin. Vanco was discontinued 
after one day of therapy as it was thought that this lesion did 
no represent a bacterial cellulitis. ___ represent chronic 
fungal infection related to chronic venous stasis. Patient 
discharged on clotrimazole cream and scheduled for dermatology 
follow-up.  

# CKD - Cr at baseline of 2.0-2.1 throughout hospitalization  
 
# ___ Disease  
-continued home sinemet

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr ___,

It was a pleasure taking care of you. You were admitted to the 
hospital for chest pain concerning for angina. Your tests did 
not show any new findings concerning for a heart attack. You did 
not have any recurrent episodes of chest tightness or ear pain. 
You were found to be in atrial fibrillation and felt 
palpitations. We gave you some medication to control your heart 
rate, you improved. We switched your beta blocker medication 
from carvedilol (coreg) to metoprolol XL 50mg daily. With this 
switch, you were able to walk around without developing an 
inappropriately fast heart rate and your symptom of feeling 
wiped out improved. You will be scheduled to follow up with an 
electrophysiologist to discuss options for treating your atrial 
fibrillation.
The redness on your right leg is likely caused by a fungal 
infection and we started you on an antifungal medication called 
clotrimazole. You should follow-up with your dermatologist about 
this.
 It is very important that you continue to weigh yourself every 
morning, call Dr. ___ weight goes up more than 3 lbs.

# acute on chronic renal failure: With patient's history of 
decreased PO intake, decreased urination, ___ highly 
suspected. Given history of renal cell carcinoma and lymphoma 
and bulky lymphadenopathy in the abdomen compressing the SVC, 
considered obstructive uropathy or ischemia to the kidneys as 
well, which was ruled out by renal US. Cr improved to 2.8 after 
some gentle IVF boluses and improved PO intake. Renal followed 
the patient in house. He was started on bicarb tabs for low 
bicarb in the setting of acute renal failure. He was continued 
on bicarb and metoprolol. ACEI and spironolactone were held 
given hyperkalemia.

Quinapril and spironolactone were held. EKG with QRS widening 
(in the setting of being ___. Got kaexylate, bicarb, 
calcium, K normalized with improved renal function.

# Bradycardia, with pacemaker for h/o recurrent VT: On admission 
the patient was bradycardic with pacer firing in the ___. This 
likely triggered his SOB sx on presentation, especially since he 
reports that his SOB resolved after his pacemaker was 
reprogrammed to fire at 70 bpm. hyperK (see above) likely led to 
widened QRS and the slow HR which triggered the patient to 
become bradycardic and the pacer to fire at 40 bpm. The 
pacemaker is set at a low rate due to the patients h/o recurrent 
monomorphic VT. On ___ the patient's pacemaker was 
___, and his intrinsic rhythm had been restored, so 
backup pacemaker rate was ___ to 40 and the patient was 
discharged in his intrinsic rhythm.

>> IMAGING:
- CXR ___: New left lower lobe consolidation worrisome for 
pneumonia. Extensive metastatic disease and mild-to-moderate 
cardiomegaly are stable.
.
- CT chest ___:
1.  New left upper lobe consolidation appears post-obstructive 
and is
concerning for pneumonia. Bilateral pleural effusions with lower 
lobe
opacities that are predominantly atelectasis.
2.  Substantial increase in size and number of diffusely 
distributed bilateral pulmonary metastases compared to ___ 
chest CT, though similar to recent radiographs.
3.  Aortic valve calcifications of indeterminate hemodynamic 
significance.
.
- TTE ___: The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild 
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size. 
There is moderate to severe regional left ventricular systolic 
dysfunction with near akinesis of the anterior septum and 
anterior walls and dyskinesis/aneurysm of the apex. The basal 
segments contract best (LVEF 25%). No intraventricular thrombus 
is seen, but technical quality is suboptimal. The right 
ventricular cavity is dilated with depressed free wall 
contractility. [Intrinsic right ventricular systolic function is 
likely more depressed given the severity of tricuspid 
regurgitation.] The aortic valve leaflets are moderately 
thickened. Significant aortic stenosis cannot be excluded. Trace 
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are 
mildly thickened. Mild to moderate (___) mitral regurgitation 
is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. 
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is mild 
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. Significant pulmonic 
regurgitation is seen. There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Mild symmetric left 
ventricular hypertrophy with extensive regional systolic 
dysfunction and apical aneurysm c/w multivessel CAD. Right 
ventricular cavity dilation with free wall hypokinesis. Moderate 
tricuspid regurgitation. Mild-moderate mitral regurgitation. 
Pulmonary artery hypertension. Compared with the prior study 
(images reviewed) of ___, the findings are similar.  
.
- LENIs ___:
1. No bilateral lower extremity deep venous thrombosis.
2. No hernia.
.
>> MICRO:
- bl cx: pending
- ucx: <10,000 organisms

ICM (EF 25% ___ s/p ICD placement in ___ (for h/o 
recurrent VT), Prostate Ca in remission, lymphoma, sarcoma, 
metastatic papillary renal cell CA to the lungs with mildine 
bulky LAD, ___ disease, prior GI bleed in ___, CKD 
presenting with SOB and found to have afib and volume overload. 
Course not complicated by worsening renal failure and acute on 
chronic anemia.

++++++++++++++++++++++++
During the course of Mr. ___ stay his clinical status 
deteriorated and it was not felt that aggressive treatment was 
within his goals of care.  Palliative care was consulted and he 
was made CMO at the expressed wishes of himself and his sons.  
He passed on ___ very comfortable with his family at his 
bedside.
=========================
.
>> Active issues:
# Dyspnea, volume overload: No hypoxemia and pt looked well on 
admission. Pt appeared volume overloaded on exam with 8lb wt 
gain from dry wt suggestive of fluid retention. Suspect dyspnea 
may be multifactorial from acute-subacute CHF exacerbation 
(worsening over ___ in setting of underlying innumerable 
pulmonary mets and possible HCAP. Trigger for CHF exacerbation 
not entirely clear but suspect related to being off of 
spironolactone and starting Na-bicarb tabs (increased daily Na). 
DDx also includes contribution from renal failure, extrinsic 
compression of IVC preventing ___ venous return. Considered 
possibility of PE as well in the pt with multiple malignancies 
but felt less likely given pt not tachycardic or hypoxemic, 
LENIs negative. Pt diuresed with IV lasix (40mg IV). ACE wraps 
used for compression to help mobilize fluid from ___. TTE without 
change in EF. ___ consulted and pt without ambulatory 
desaturations. Pt returned to dry wt on ___ (wt 186lb). I/Os and 
wts subsequently difficult to monitor. UOP significantly 
decreased and pt appeared more volume overload. Respiratory 
status acutely worsened on evening of ___ prompting ICU 
transfer.
.
# Acute on chronic renal failure: Cr was stable with diuresis in 
2.4-2.7 range and uptrended after diuresis held starting ___. Cr 
reached 4-range and pt became oliguric. DDx for worsening renal 
failure includes prerenal RF in the setting of diureis and acute 
anemia, ATN as BPs soft during admission (SBPs 80-90s and 
possibly further hypotension not documented); less likely AIN as 
urine eso neg and no peripheral eos (also no rash). FEurea 18% 
and UA with numerous hyaline casts suggestive of prerenal 
etiology though urine lytes difficult to interpret in the 
setting of oliguria. Renal followed. Pt likely to need HD but 
not pursued with change in GOCs on ICU transfer.
.
# Acute on Chronic Anemia: Hct has downtrended from 35 to ___ s/p 
1u pRBCs. Baseline Hct in low ___ recently, mildly macrocytic 
anemia. Anemia likely related to intramuscular hematoma and 
flank ecchymosis. CT without evidence of RP bleed. No evidence 
of hemolysis on labs. Hct relatively stable with mild downtrend 
after transfusion.
.
# HCAP: Admission CXR with new LLL consolidation but clinically 
pt without signs of infection including fevers, leukocytosis. 
DDx included effusion, atelectasis, PNA. Cough present so Pulm 
consulted per attending recs. Before starting ABX, pt went for 
non-con CT chest to better evaluate LLL consolidation that was 
difficult to assess on CXR. CT showed LUL consolidation 
concerning for post-obstructive PNA. Pt started on HCAP coverage 
with vanc/cefepime/levoflox on ___ per pulm recs. Plan for 8d 
course of HCAP coverage. PICC line placed.
.
# Hyperkalemia: s/p calcium gluconate, insulin/D50 and lasix in 
ED. K subsequently stable with diuresis.
.
# Afib: chronic AF, which is adequately rate controlled today; 
The patient is not on anticoagulation for AF given prior hx of 
GIB. EP does not believe afib likely significant contributor to 
fluid retention. Continued amiodarone and ASA.
.
# R flank ecchymosis: developed ___ over span of approx 8hrs. 
Etiology not entirely clear. Pt believes related to jostling 
during transport to CT scan. Ecchymosis is quite extensive and 
unlikely to be related simply to heparin injection. Considered 
possibility of spontaneous RP bleed. Monitor Hct closely.
.
# Elevated lactate, resolved: likely related to volume overlaod 
and poor perfusional state; improved with diuresis
.
>> Chronic issues:
# sCHF/ICM, CAD:cont ASA 325, atorva, Plavix, metop as tartrate
.
# ___: cont sinemet
.
# H/o Prostate Ca/BPH: cont finasteride
.
# H/o Gout: cont allopurinol
