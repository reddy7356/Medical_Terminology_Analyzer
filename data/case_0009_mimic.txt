History of Present Illness:
Per psychiatric evaluation notes from ED and ___ medical 
setting over the last week, this is a ___ year old woman with no 
formal past psychiatric history who has presented several times 
to ___ ED in recent weeks with concerns of depression and 
suicidal thinking. Most recently she was brought in by her 
sister because she was having increasing trouble sleeping and 
command auditory hallucinations to kill her family and herself. 
The episode appeared to have begun shortly after a family 
vacation to ___ and ___. The trip was 
generally enjoyable but at the end experienced decreased 
appetite and depressed mood, which has been worsening with 
thoughts to stab herself in the chest. She has also experienced 
worsening insomnia, pervasive religious thoughts such as losing 
her soul, and ongoing auditory and visual hallucinations. A 
short stay in the CSU earlier this month was not found to be 
helpful.

On admission interview the patient confirms this story. She 
continues to feel depressed and suicidal, with a "bad spirit" 
commanding her to kill her family and herself (though she says 
she doesn't want to) and being afraid to watch TV because it 
keeps sending her special messages. She says that at the 
beginning of the medical admission she was very scared and 
confused but does not feel that way as much anymore. She is glad 
to be in the psychiatric unit because she understands that she 
needs help now.

2. Medical:  The patient was admitted on ___ to the medical 
service for unexplained leukocytosis in the context of altered 
mental status.

-Altered mental status:  Lumbar puncture, CT and MRI head, 
urine, blood, and stool studies were all negative for possible 
infectious or metabolic causes of encephalopathy.  The patient 
was treated with antibiotics briefly but these were discontinued 
when infectious processes were ruled out.  Occasional catatonic 
episodes were noted so benzodiazepines were instituted in place 
of antipsychotics for anxiety or agitation concerns.  In the 
psychiatry inpatient unit, there were no anxiety or agitation 
concerns, and did not display any acute altered mental status.   
 

-Pulmonary emboli:  On the medical service, she developed 
tachycardia to the 150s.  CT-Chest revealed segmental to 
subsegmental bilateral pulmonary emboli which were treated with 
Lovenox bridging to Coumadin.  Lovenox was discontinued once INR 
reached therapeutic range of ___.  She continues on Coumadin 2.5 
mg, and her INR as of ___ is 2.7, on 2.5mg coumadin daily.  
***PCP should followup INR at next visit, which is on ___

-Chronic pain:  There were no pain control issues.  Her pain was 
well-controlled on Tylenol.   
 
3. Psychiatric:  She was admitted on ___ to the psychiatry 
inpatient unit for safety, stabilization, and psychopharm 
evaluation, on citalopram 20 mg and olanzapine 15 mg.  Medicine 
workup for organic etiologies of her acute onset 
depression/psychosis were negative.  We added a urine 
porphobilinogen screen to rule out porphyria, which was 
negative.  

-Depression:  On admission, she reported improvement of her 
depression.  However, she still endorsed depressed mood and mild 
neurovegetative symptoms so citalopram was increased to 40 mg.  
She also exhibited a slow gait and mild psychomotor retardation, 
possibly a result of her depression.  This improved over the 
course of her hospitalization, but she still exhibits some 
residual psychomotor retardation. 

-Psychosis:  She endorsed command auditory hallucinations 
consisting of one unidentifiable genderless voice which she 
attributes as "the devil" telling her to hurt herself and her 
children.  She reports not having any auditory hallucinations 
since ___.  She also endorses ideas of reference, but it 
remains unclear how long she has had these.  At times she 
displayed circumstantial and mildly disorganized speech.  Though 
she exhibited a full affective range, she also intermittently 
became withdrawn and exhibited a flattened affect, notably 
during discussion of her psychotic symptoms.  Olanzapine was 
increased to 20 mg on ___, and she did well on that dose. 

-Sleep:  Patient has had trouble with sleep with this episode.  
She has been able to sleep well with Benadryl, and only reported 
one period of hypersomnolence on the morning of ___ after 
increase of Celexa to 40 mg and Zyprexa to 20 mg.  She has had 
no issues thereafter.  

-SI/HI:  She was originally evaluated in the ED for suicidal 
ideation and homicidal ideation towards her children with vague 
plan but no intent.  She reports that these thoughts were from 
the voice she hears in her head though not her own.  She has not 
endorsed any SI/HI since this voice has stopped talking to her.  
She is at a low acute risk of self harm and harm to others due 
to clinical improvement of her depression/psychosis on a stable 
medical regimen, no history of attempts, and good social 
supports. 
 
4. Psychosocial:  Child protection (___) safety evaluation due 
to homicidal ideation but without plan or intent towards 
children.  No other issues.  Family is supportive.

Brief Hospital Course:
___ y/o woman, essentially healthy p/w increasing depression over 
the past ___ weeks, very poor sleep, and thoughts of harming 
herself and her family, with noted altered mental status, 
leukocytosis and low grade fevers occasionally, negative 
infectious workup, found to have bilateral segmental to 
sub-segmental PE.  
.  
.
<h2><b>Plan:</b></h2>
.
# PE: Patient found to have bilateral PE, which explains 
occasional low grade fevers, mild leukocytosis, and sinus 
tachycardia. Patient was guaic negative and then initiated on 
Coumadin 5mg PO daily with Lovenox BID (1mg/kg BID) to bridge. 
Patient's risk factors include sedentary state given several day 
stay in the ED prior to admission. Patient will need careful 
follow up of INR to maintain goal INR of ___, with first check 
due on ___. Therapy for 3 months. After that, patient will 
need to be evaluated by PCP for possibility of coagulation 
disorder. These tests are likely to be inaccurate in the acute 
setting given active disease and treatment with anticoagulants. 
Patient is clinically stable. Also, patient was informed that 
she should not be on any estrogen-containing medications, 
including oral contraceptives or other estrogen-containing 
contraceptives, since these medications will increase risk of 
future blood clots. Psychiatry team is welcome to contact 
medical team or medical consult service for guidance on coumadin 
if patient still in-house.
. 
#?toxic-metabolic encephalopathy: patient appears medically 
stable from this standpoint, has had thorough evaluation for 
infection, including negative CXR, LP, MRI head, CT head, HIV, 
urine, blood cultures, RPR, RBC smear for malaria, C diff, O&P 
prelim cultures. Stool cultures for bacteria pending but patient 
no longer having diarrhea, guaic negative. She has been afebrile 
for >48 hours at this point without antibiotics.
-The mild leukocytosis without left shift & occasional low-grade 
fevers clinically correlates with PE.
-Patient is not on medications that would cause her altered 
mental status. There are no reported toxic ingestions. Patient's 
citalopram and olanzapine doses were recently altered, but this 
is unlikely to be the cause of her recent alteration. 
- Electrolyte levels are within normal limits, with no evidence 
of uremia or liver dysfunction.  
- ___ neg x2. CRP/ESR wnl in evaluating for lupus cerebritis vs. 
other rheumatologic/autoimmune processes.
-TSH within normal limits.
.  
# Depression w psychotic features: patient w new depression with 
SI/HI, along with psychotic features. There is some concern for 
catatonic component, therefore haloperidol should be avoided in 
favor of benzodiazepines for management. Patient was found to be 
cataonic several times during admission but currently no 
psychomotor retardation. 
- Patient and husband say that she has always been hypochondriac 
and pt in past has been pre-occupied with getting sick all the 
time.
- continues to have voices.
- continue Zyprexa 10 QHS, Ativan 2 mg QHS prn insomnia  
- continue home dose citalopram  
- avoid haloperidol due to concern for catatonia  
- would appreciate psych recs; likely transfer today
- continue 1:1 seclusion  
- continue ___ status; inpatient psychiatric treatment.

months.  

 
Discharge Disposition:
Extended Care
 
Discharge Diagnosis:
Pulmonary Emboli

 
Discharge Condition:
Mental Status: Confused - sometimes.

Activity Status: Ambulatory - Independent.

 
Discharge Instructions:
It was a pleasure taking care of you at the ___ 
___. You presented to the hospital with 
symptoms of severe depression, including thoughts of hurting 
yourself & others. During your admission, we found that you had 
blood clots in your lungs, for which you are treated with blood 
thinners (Coumadin by mouth for 3 months & Lovenox injections 
BID for roughly 1 week until blood levels of coumadin are 
therapeutic, to be determined by your PCP or consulting medical 
physician). It is unclear why you developed this lung process 
and you will need to follow up with your PCP after this episode 
resolves to obtain blood tests to assess your risk for future 
episodes. Also, you will need to avoid estrogen-containing 
medications such as oral contraceptives or other contraceptives, 
which may increase your risk for developing blood clots.
.
During this admission, we did a thorough evaluation for 
infection and we do not believe you have an active infectious 
process. You did present with an elevated white blood cell 
count, which can be associated with infections, but this is seen
