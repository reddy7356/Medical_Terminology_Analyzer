CXR ___:
IMPRESSION:    
Large cavitary lesion in the region of the superior segment of 
the right lower lobe, abutting the posterior pleura, with a 
small amount of layering fluid within the central cavity.  
Diagnostic consideration include cavitating bacterial pneumonia, 
as well as TB and other atypical infections.  Malignancy is less 
likely, given the patient's young age. 
  
RECOMMENDATION(S):  Chest CT with intravenous contrast is 
suggested to better define the cavitary lesion and confirm that 
it is parenchymal and not pleural. 
.
CT chest ___:
 
6.1 cm dense consolidation in the superior segment of the right 
lower lobe with an internal 1.6 cm rounded cavity, associated 
bronchiectasis, and right-sided hilar lymphadenopathy. Given the 
patient's clinical history, primary differential consideration 
is infectious etiology, likely a cavitating bacterial pneumonia. 
Other atypical infections, including TB, can also cause 
cavitating lung lesions. Due to the patient's young age, 
malignancy is less likely. 
  
RECOMMENDATION(S): It would be reasonable to obtain followup 
imaging after treatment, to assess for improvement or 
resolution.

no recent abdominal imaging

___ ___:
A retrograde single balloon enteroscopy was performed. 
The enteroscope was advanced until approximately 40 cm from the 
ileocecal valve. Normal mucosa was noted until 40 cm from the 
ileocecal valve. 
The scope could not be advanced further because of acute 
angulations of the ileum
 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ yo male with small bowel and perianal Crohn's now with c/o 
black stools and 10-pt hematocrit drop since ___. 

#1. GIB. Concern for PUD vs Crohn's associated ulcers. Perhaps 
precipitated by Advil usage. No LH, dizziness, or abdominal 
pain. GI was consutled and pt underwent EGD which showed a 
___ tear at the GE junction and mild deformity of the 
second part of the duodenum, not explaining his blood loss. 
Colonoscopy showed normal mucosa with a suboptimal bowel prep. 
As a small bowel source was possible, MRE was obtained and 
showed no acute change; there were "areas of chronic stricturing 
just beyond the small bowel anastomosis and at the terminal 
ileum that are unchanged in appearance from the prior MR and are 
in keeping with chronic fibro-stenosing Crohn's disease. There 
are no definite features to suggest active inflammation." Pt's 
diet was advanced, and he remained asymptomatic without further 
black stool. He was maintained on a PPI, and sucralfate slurry 
was added. Patency endoscopy with capsule is being considered 
and may be pursued in the outpatient setting. Pt followed 
closely by GI Dr ___. 

#2. pancytopenia: Likely related to ___ toxicity. ___ was 
therefore held, and other possible etiologies were checked, such 
as parvovirus and CMV. Those results were pending at the time of 
discharge. WBC rose to 4, and pt was discharged off ___. 
Macrocytosis was attributed to known vitamin B12 deficiency. He 
is to return to clinic for labs on ___.  

#3. Crohns: stable, no evidence active disease. ___ discontinued 
as above, continued pentasa. 

#4. Chronic pain: stable, continued home regimen

EGD ___:
Erosions in the second part of the duodenum with evidence of 
bleeding, treated successfully with cautery and clips. (thermal 
therapy, endoclip)
Otherwise normal EGD to second part of the duodenum.

EGD ___:
Friability and congestion of the mucosa with contact bleeding 
were noted in the second part of the duodenum compatible with 
duodenitis. Multiple superficial ulcers were found in the second 
part of the duodenum which could be secondary to crohn's 
disease. There was no sign of active bleeding. Scarring of ___ 
part of duodenum.
 
Brief Hospital Course:
1. Duodenitis with blood loss:
Patient was initially admitted to the MICU for hct drop from 35 
to 25. EGD showed duodenal ulcerations which were cauterized and 
clipped. He had 1 further episode of melena the morning after 
the endoscopy. He was treated with a PPI drip for over 12 hours 
post-procedure, then changed to pantoprazole 40mg PO BID. He was 
transfused 1 unit pRBCs due to the hct drop and tachycardia, 
latter felt to be related to anxiety and anemia. He had recieved 
4L IVF in the ED and was not felt to be dehydrated as he was 
urinating large volumes. His diet was advanced to regular and he 
was restarted on his PO prednisone and mesalamine. His ___ was 
held per GI recommendations. He remained hemodynamically stable 
and was transferred to the floor. On arrival, he had further 
tachycardia, which resolved with encouraged PO intake. He had 
two more episodes of melena, with associated hct drop (see 
Pertinent Results). Was transfused a total of 3 more units pRBCs 
on the floor. Repeat EGD showed duodenitis with friable mucosa, 
likely secondary to Crohn's. After PPD was negative, he was 
given a remicade infusion as an inpatient. His hematocrit 
continued to be followed and remained stable.

1. Crohn's Disease 
2. B12 deficiency 
 
Discharge Condition:
Stable, with no active signs of bleeding.

 
Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted to the hospital with blood in your bowel 
movements.  You had an endoscopy which showed bleeding in the 
duodenum and this was treated.  Your blood levels (hematocrit) 
were stable but low (25.6%) and so you were transfused with one 
unit of red blood cells, which brought it up to 31.8%. You were 
then transferred to the regular medicine floor, where you were 
found to have a fast heart rate, which improved with increased 
fluid consumption. You received another 3 units of blood due to 
dropping hematocrit. Another endoscopy showed fragile small 
intestine, so you received remicade for your Crohn's. We further 
followed your hematocrit, and it remained stable.

Please take all medications as prescribed and go to all follow 
up appointments. Your ___ was stopped during this admission. 
You should take the proton-pump inhibitor (pantoprazole) to 
prevent upper gastrointestinal bleed. You will continue on 
remicade and prednisone taper as instructed by your GI doctor. 

You should return to the hospital for any further episodes of 
dark, tarry stools with lightheadness, dizziness or fainting.  
You should return to the hospital for any bright red blood in 
your bowel movements.  You should return to the hospital for any 
vomiting with or without blood.  You should contact your doctor 
or seek medical care for any fevers > 100.4, chills, night 
sweats, abdominal pain, chest pain, shortness of breath, 
bleeding episodes, excessive fatigue, leg swelling or any other 
symptoms that concern you.
