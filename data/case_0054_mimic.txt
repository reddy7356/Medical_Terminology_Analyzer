Brief Hospital Course:
___ yo male with metastatic melanoma now found to have two 
metastases, one to the sella and a second in the superficial 
right frontal lobe at the coronal suture.
The patient is now s/p right frontal craniotomy for resection of 
the right frontal lesion. 

#Right frontal lesion
The patient underwent a right frontal craniotomy and resection 
___ ___. For further details please refer 
to OMR for brief op note and operative report. Following the 
procedure the patient was transferred to the PACU for post 
anesthesia care and monitoring. He was then transferred to the 
Neuroscience Intermediate Care Unit for overnight surveillance 
and management. He remained neurologically intact and returned 
to his baseline. He was assessed by physical therapy and 
occupational therapy who both recommended discharge to home with 
home services. Case Management set up ___ services to assess 
patient at home on ___. 
The hematology/oncology team was following and agreed that 
patient had no acute oncological inpatient needs and could be 
discharged home with outpatient follow up. Appropriate 
appointments were set up for him and provided in discharge 
paperwork. 
On POD ___, he was felt to be neurologically stable and 
discharged home with outpatient follow up.  

#Adrenal insufficiency
During the ___ prior admission, Endocrinology started him 
on hydrocortisone bid. He was subsequently discharged home on 
Hydrocort BID. He was started on Dexamethasone post operatively, 
in which he will have a taper dose upon discharge. He will 
maintain a Dexamethasone 2mg BID dosing until follow up with 
BTC. Endocrine was made aware/consulted on ___ and confirmed 
that this was appropriate dosing and not to restart the 
hydrocort until the dexamethasone was discontinued. The on call 
fellow was to reach out to ___ primary ___ MD and 
alert them of changes and for follow up care. 
He was also hyperglycemic due to steroid usage - requiring 
intermittent low dose insulin regimen. It was confirmed with 
Endocrine to not discharge with home insulin regiment, as this 
is expected to autoregulate with the tapering of the steroid. 

#Liver disease/ETOH use
Pt had no signs or symptoms of alcohol withdrawal while 
inpatient. 

#Hypothyroidism
He was maintained on his home dose of Levothyroxine. 

#Hypogonadism
#Hypotension 
Upon assessment of previous discharge medications, it was 
determined that his home dose of Metoprolol BID was held and he 
was to follow up with his PCP. He remained intermittently 
hypotensive while hospitalized, with his Metoprolol being 
intermittently held. It was discontinued upon discharge and he 
is to follow up with his PCP on when to restart this medication.

Normal right ventricular cavity size with normal free wall 
motion. The aortic sinus diameter is normal for gender with 
mildly dilated ascending aorta. There is a normal descending 
aorta diameter. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear 
structurally normal. There is no aortic valve stenosis. There is 
no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets appear 
structurally normal with no mitral valve prolapse. There is

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ is a ___ w/ ___ metastatic melanoma (on nivolumab), 
AFib, recent DVT (on apixaban) who was transferred from ___ 
to the ___ ICU for septic shock ___ E. coli bacteremia, course 
c/b AFib w/ RVR requiring cardioversion, acute hypoxemic 
respiratory failure, non-occluding IVC clot and IVC compression 
from R adrenal mass, clinically improved on the floor and ready 
for rehab. 

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES
===================
[] Will complete 14 day course of PO vancomycin (last day ___
[] Found to have adrenal mass compression of IVC, but no 
intervention was done ___ thrombocytopenia. Discuss in the 
outpatient setting role of IVC filter/stenting. 

ACUTE ISSUES
============
#E.coli bacteremia
#Septic shock
His ___ cultures grew pan sensitive E.coli, which have been 
negative since then. He completed a 14 day course of ceftriaxone 
on ___. On ___, the patient was noted to be rigoring and 
hypotensive on the floor requiring transfer back to the ICU. He 
was briefly on norepinephrine and was fluid resuscitated. 
Antibiotics were broadened to vancomycin and cefepime. He 
subsequently improved. Cultures continued to show no growth and 
he was transferred back to the floor. His antibiotics were 
stopped on ___.

#AFib w/ RVR
He has a history of atrial fibrillation at baseline on digoxin. 
He presented to OSH w/ rapid AFib, likely due to infection vs. 
being volume up in the setting of his decompensation after 
leaving the hospital on ___ was given an amiodarone load at 
OSH, followed by diltiazem and then was electrically 
cardioverted for hypotension. He was started on levophed, 
neosynephrine, and vasopressin briefly but was titrated off 
shortly after. We checked a digoxin level that was normal and 
continued his home digoxin, he remained in normal sinus rhythm.  
His home apixiban was held in the setting of his 
thrombocytopenia but was restarted once Plt > 50.

#Acute hypoxemic respiratory failure
His new oxygen requirement was likely due to pleural effusions 
and volume overload. He was quickly weaned off HFNC and is now 
on room air or nasal cannula. He is still volume overloaded and 
would benefit from more diuresis. After diuresis, a repeat CXR 
showed interval improvement of pleural effusion and vascular 
congestion. He was diuresed throughout his general oncology 
floor admission to maintain adequate respiration with a goal of 
1L net negative.

#Thrombocytopenia
Platelets dropped from normal range to <20 over the course of 1 
week. Hematology saw the patient and thought this was due to 
bone marrow suppression in the setting of septic shock/acute 
illness along with a history of alcohol use and recent 
cephalexin use (for cellulitis). TTP, DIC, HIT, and HIV induced 
thrombocytopenia were ruled out. He received 2 platelet 
transfusions that he tolerated well. He had a blood smear w/o
schistocytes. His home apixaban was held until plt > 50.

#C/f adrenal insufficiency
#Chronic steroid use
He has a history of adrenal insufficiency d/t immunotherapy and 
is on chronic hydrocortisone 20 mg qAM and 10 mg qHS. This was 
felt to have contributed to his shock physiology on admission. 
He was started on high dose steroids while hypotensive, but 
tapered back to home dose of steroids by the time of discharge. 

#Non occlusive IVC clot
#Hx of DVT/PE
He received a CTA venogram showing increased compression of IVC 
from an adrenal mass, causing a non-occlusive IVC thrombus. 
Vascular surgery were consulted inpatient but declined 
intervention given his clinical comorbidities. If indicated, 
will need to follow up as an outpatient for IVC filter/stent 
placement.

#Coagulopathy
This was thought to be likely nutritional. His admission INR was 
1.6; it improved with improved PO intake.

# Delirium
He had intermittent delirium while clinically sick. He was able 
to be redirected by his brother occasionally, and resolved days 
before discharge.

#C. diff colitis
Diagnosed at OSH, not currently having diarrhea. His PO vanc was 
continued throughout admission, will complete course through 
___.

#Metastatic melanoma
Currently on nivolumab monotherapy (C8 ___. His outpatient 
oncologist Dr. ___ was informed throughout.

#Severe protein calorie malnutrition
Albumin 1.8 on admission. Nutrition was consulted throughout 
admission.

CHRONIC ISSUES
==============
#DM2
Pt with improved BG after gastric bypass, not on home meds 
currently. He was on SSI while on steroids.

#HTN
Improved after gastric bypass, not on home meds

#Alcohol use disorder
#NAFLD
Steatosis but not cirrhosis noted on imaging. Not showing signs 
of withdrawal.

#Macrocytic anemia
Likely iso chronic alcohol use, received B12 supplements

#Hypothyroidism
Continued home levothyroxine

Past Medical History:
ONCOLOGIC HISTORY:
Mr. ___ noted a "blood blister" on his abdomen many years 
ago
which resolved on its own.  Then, approximately a year prior to
presentation, this started to grow again and bled occasionally.
He was referred by his PCP to dermatology where he saw ___, NP, on ___ with a 2 x 2
centimeter inflamed plaque with a central ulcer on the right
abdomen noted.  Biopsy revealed nodular melanoma, present at
peripheral and deep margins, at least 7.5 mm deep, at least
___ level 4, ulcerated, 29 mitoses per millimeter squared,
absent lymphovascular and perineural invasion on the original
pathology though the specimen was reviewed in our cutaneous
oncology conference and felt to show lymphovascular invasion. 
The patient was referred here for further management.  He went 
on
to have a wide local excision and sentinel lymph node biopsy on
___.  This showed residual melanoma to 11 mm depth, 
2
of 6 recovered lymph nodes with micrometastases.

Initial staging scans on ___ revealed metastatic disease 
in
the left arm, right peritoneum, right adrenal, and left
infrahilar lymph node consistent with metastatic disease.  Brain
MRI showed no CNS metastases.  He underwent FNA of the left arm
nodule on ___ by Dr. ___ melanoma. 

Admitted to ___ with worsening SOB on ___, found 
to
have a PE, put on anticoagulation but developed abdominal wall
hematoma so, IVC filter placed. He has a history of developing 
GI
bleed while on anticoagulation in the past for atrial
fibrillation.

Was initially considered for Clinical Trial but could not be
enrolled due to elevated LFTs ( likely in the setting of acute
heavy alcohol use). 

Pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg every 3 weeks started on ___. 
Progression seen on scans on ___, therefore treatment
transitioned to ipi/nivo.

He completed 4 cycles Ipi/Nivo with good response and was
transitioned to nivolumab monotherapy. He was subsequently
hospitalized with adrenal failure and was found to have
metastatic disease to the brain. 

Neurosurgery was completed ___. Subsequent imaging revealed
ongoing abnormalities in the resection base so received CK
radiation to the site from ___.

for ongoing pressor requirement and shock of unknown etiology as 
below. He was eventually weaned off and clinically improving so 
he was called out of the ICU.

ACUTE ISSUES
===========
#Adrenal Insufficiency 
#Hypotension
Initially thought to be due to poor PO intake resulting in 
hypovolemia and continued use of diuresis vs sepsis however no 
infectious source was localized on CXR, CT abd/pelv, or blood 
culutres. The patient continued to be intermittently hypotensive 
despite fluid resuscitation. on ___, the patient was noted to 
have a low random cortisol level. He triggered ___ in the 
evening for hypotension. He already had a positive cosyntropin 
stimulation test prior to receiving IV hydrocortisone. The 
steroids stabilized his blood pressure and he was continued on 
them around the clock. The etiology of the adrenal insufficiency 
is unclear, as it may be due to tumor invasion of the R adrenal 
gland vs nivolumab induced adrenal insufficiency. Panhypopit was 
a consideration although given the elevated tsh (discussed 
below) this would not fit. An ACTH level was sent to confirm the 
diagnosis. Endocrinology was consulted. The patient was also 
noted to have hypothyroidism and hypogonadism. Pituitary MRI 
showed a pituitary adenoma measuring up to 1.2 cm in the 
anterior aspect, similar compared to ___. Ultimately, 
he was discharged with hydrocort repletion. He will follow up in 
___ clinic.

#Primary Hypothyroidism ___ Nivolumab
Patient reportedly takes synthroid at home for treatment of 
hypothyroidism caused by his nivolumab. His TSH was elevated 
although it was unclear if the patient was compliant with the 
medication. He was noted to have an elevated antithyroglobulin 
antibody level. Endocrine wanted to increase his dose to 100mcg.

#Macrocytic Anemia
Hemoglobin initially downtrended and then stabilized around 9, 
believed to be likely initially a component of dilution. CT A/P 
was without evidence of bleed. Anemia was thought to possibly be 
related to alcohol or hypothyroidism. Also possibly an element 
of hemoconcentration in the setting of recent poor PO intake. Hg 
remained stable throughout the rest of the hospital course.

#Atrial Fibrillation
Continued digoxin. Held metoprolol while on norepinephrine with 
plan to restart once
stabilized

#Melanoma Stage IV
#New brain metastasis
Patient has metastatic disease s/p resection of abdominal mass 
and ALND on chemotherapy. He is on nevolumab C2D1 ___. He 
is followed by heme/onc and palliative care as outpatient. 
Pituitary MRI revealed new brain metastasis, for which he will 
follow up with neuro-onc as an outpatient.

#Myocardial injury
Thought to be most likely from ___, with no ischemic changes on 
EKG or reported chest pain, but did have cocaine use so would 
consider direct cardiotoxic effect vs cocaine induced MI. Repeat 
troponin downtrending. 

#Acute Kidney Injury 
Was believed to be most likely pre-renal from poor po intake, 
though may have also had some renal toxicity from the cocaine. 
Resolved.

#PE s/p IVC filter ___:
Continued to monitor

#EtOH Abuse
He was placed on ___ protocol 

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: 
======================
-Follow-up: Onc, neuro-onc, endocrinology, hepatology, dentistry
-New medications: Hydrocortisone 20 mg qam and 10 mg qpm (for 
adrenal insufficiency), MVI, thiamine, Peridex mouth wash BID 
for 7 days (last day ___.
-Changed medications: levothyroxine increased to 100mcg daily
-Held medications: KCl, metoprolol. Please monitor K and BP as 
an outpatient and consider restarting these medications.
-Adrenal insufficiency: Likely related to his immunotherapy. 
Endocrinology started him on hydrocort. Has instructions for 
stress dose steroids. Needs a med alert bracelet.
-Intracranial metastasis: New intracranial metastasis found on 
MRI. His disease has been known progressive as an outpatient. He 
will follow-up with neuro-onc as an outpatient.
-Liver disease/ETOH use: Has evidence of alcohol-induced liver 
damage and small ascites. Will need to continue ETOH cessation 
management as well as hepatology follow-up.
-Hypothyroidism: Synthroid was changed to 100 mcg per 
endocrinology.
-Hypogonadism: Low DHEA, consider testosterone if symptomatic.
-Dental carries: He was seen by OMFS at ___ who recommended

Dear Mr. ___,

It was a pleasure caring for you at ___

right dose of steroids to give you  

WHAT SHOULD I DO AFTER I LEAVE THE HOSPITAL?
-Continue to take all your medicines and keep your appointments.
-Please take your hydrocortisone 20mg in the morning and 10mg in 
the afternoon. You were given a short term prescription to fill 
at another pharmacy while your main pharmacy waits to get the 
medication shipped. Please be sure to call your main pharmacy 
tomorrow and a few days prior to any refills to be sure that 
they have your medicine in stock. It is ESSENTIAL that you take 
your hydrocortisone regularly.
-Take double steroid dose for two days if you feel sick or have 
a cold. Furthermore you should triple the dose for three days if 
you are very ill. 
-Take intra-muscular Dexamethasone 4mg if you have nausea or 
vomiting and are unable to take your oral medications and you 
feel extremely ill.

Brief Hospital Course:
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES
=========================
- Follow up with Oncology for progression of malignancy.
- On ciprofloxacin PO (same bioavailability as IV). for GNR 
bacteremia. Note cultures from ___ health couldn't 
speciate the GNR in only one sample (failed to grow in both 
aerobic and anaerobic cultures). Low risk it's not covered by 
cipro (which covers most GNRs) but patient is aware he needs 
close monitoring if he spikes in the event organism is not 
covered by Ciprofloxacin.

Mr. ___ is a ___ male with atrial 
fibrillation and DVT (on apixaban), adrenal insufficiency, and 
metastatic melanoma to the brain s/p resection and radiation

No localizing symptoms except for R abd pain likely ___ pt's 
mass and non-specific teeth pain. UA negative. LFTs were mildly 
elevated but not consistent with obstructive cholangitis and 
___ sign was negative. Initially on empiric vancomycin, 
ceftriaxine, and flagyl --> narrowed to
CTX based on GNR bacteremia. ___ at ___ 
couldn't speciate the final organism as it did not grow both in 
aerobic and anaerobic cultures. Given such good clinical 
improvement, the patient was discharged on ciprofloxacin PO 
(same bioavailability as IV) with plan for 14 day treatment 
given immune status with malignancy and likely treatment.
