Pertinent Results:
___
Intra-op TEE
PREBYPASS 
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is 
moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left 
ventricular cavity size is top normal/borderline dilated. There 
is no regionality. There is moderate global left ventricular 
hypokinesis (LVEF = 30 %). Right ventricular chamber size and 
free wall motion are normal. The ascending aorta is mildly 
dilated. The aortic valve is bicuspid. The aortic valve leaflets 
are severely thickened/deformed. Significant aortic stenosis is 
present (not quantified). The mitral valve leaflets are mildly 
thickened. An eccentric, posteriorly directed jet of Mild to 
moderate (___) mitral regurgitation is seen. Due to the 
eccentric nature of the regurgitant jet, its severity may be 
significantly underestimated (Coanda effect).

POSTBYPASS
LV systolic function is improved. LVEF ~50%. RV systolic 
function remains normal. There is a well seated, well 
functioning bioprosthesis in the aortic position. No obvious AI 
is visualized. The MR now appears trace. The study is otherwise 
unchanged from prebypass  

CXR
PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___   
COMPARISON:  Radiographs of two days earlier.  
FINDINGS:  Subcutaneous emphysema is again demonstrated in the 
right chest 
wall.  There is no visible pneumothorax.  Stable postoperative 
appearance of cardiomediastinal contours, with minimal residual 
pneumopericardium remaining.  Improved aeration in left lower 
lobe with residual minor atelectasis remaining as well as a 
small left effusion.  Small-to-moderate right pleural effusion 
appears similar to the prior study, but adjacent basilar 
atelectasis has slightly improved.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was brought to the Operating Room on ___ where 
the patient underwent AVR, ___ ligation with Dr. ___.  
Overall the patient tolerated the procedure well and 
post-operatively was transferred to the CVICU in stable 
condition for recovery and invasive monitoring.  
POD 1 found the patient extubated, alert and oriented and 
breathing comfortably.  The patient was neurologically intact 
and hemodynamically stable, weaned from inotropic and 
vasopressor support.  Beta blocker was initiated and the patient 
was gently diuresed toward the preoperative weight.  Coumadin 
was started for anti-coagulation for chronic atrial 
fibrillation.  Pradaxa should be held for at least one month 
following cardiac surgery.  The patient was transferred to the 
telemetry floor for further recovery.  He remained in atrial 
fibrillation with BBB, with asymtomatic, self-limiting rapid 
bursts.  Chest tubes and pacing wires were discontinued without 
complication.  The patient was evaluated by the physical therapy 
service for assistance with strength and mobility.  His 
discharge was held for one day because he had hypoglycemia to 58 
(only symptom diaphoresis) while on lantus 10units daily, but 
had no further problems once insulin was stopped.  By the time 
of discharge on POD 5, the patient was ambulating freely, the 
wound was healing and pain was controlled with oral analgesics.  
The patient was discharged to home with Art of Care ___ service 
in good condition with appropriate follow up instructions.
