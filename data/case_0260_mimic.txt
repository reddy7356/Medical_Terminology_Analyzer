IMPRESSION:  
1. Diffusely heterogeneous hepatic echogenicity and coarse 
texture consistent with cirrhosis. A small approximately 1-cm 
left hepatic lobe lesion. Further characterization with MR is

Hct remained stable s/p total of 6units pRBCs at around 31.

#. Cirrhosis: Patient with evidence of cirrhosis from MR from 
___. Cirrhosis likely ___ EtOH and HCV. Patient remained 
with good mental status throughout MICU course. No need for 
lactulose. The cause for decompesnation was investigated. Pt had 
a normal AFP 4.1, and liver MRI done which showed marked 
nodularity without any masses suggestive of HCC. It was 
recommended given the diffuse abnormality, followup MRI in four 
months is suggested. HIV was also negative.

#. EtOH abuse: Patient was started on ___ protocol and did not

Discharge Disposition:
Home
 
Discharge Diagnosis:
Primary diagnosis:
- ruptured esophageal varices - causing hematemesis and melana

Secondary diagnosis:
- End-stage liver disease
- Hepatitis C
- alcohol abuse
- history of previous variceal bleed

 
Discharge Condition:
good, vitals stable, Hct stable, no longer having 
hematemsis/coffe-ground emesis

 
Discharge Instructions:
You were vomitting blood because of decompensated liver disease, 
i.e., worsening of your cirrhosis. The liver disease caused the 
pressure in the vessesls of the esophagus to get higher until 
they burst under pressure. These esophageal varices were banded 
under EGD(endoscopy) and you were given medications to stop the 
bleeding. You were monitered until you were stable to go home. 
You should completely stop drinking all together. 

Medication changes:
- nadalol 20mg once per day to decrease the pressure of these 
esophageal blood vessesls
- take sucrulfate 1g four times a day for 2 weeks to help 
protect your stomach
- your prilosec was increased to twice per day
- also take thiamine, folate, and a multivitamin everyday

If you begin vomitting blood again or have coffee-ground like 
vomit, have a temp > 100.4, dark-black tarry stools, become 
confused, or your abdomen becomes significantly swollen - then 
return to the ED immediately.
 
Followup Instructions:

continued on IV folate, thiamine, and multivitamin.  THe patient 
was seen by social work regarding his alcohol abuse.  The

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,
.
It was a pleasure taking care of you while you were hospitalized 
at ___.  You were admitted to the hospital because you were 
vomiting blood.  You were taken to the intensive care unit and 
an emergent scope was done and a camera was out down into your 
stomach.  We found that you had a bleed blood vessel (varix) 
that was causing you to vomit up blood.  We injected your varix 
with glue and the bleeding has stopped.
. 
You have been stable since the procedure and you have not bled.
.
It is VERY important that you stop drinking.  The reason you 
have your varix and these dilated blood vessels is because your 
heavy alcohol drinking has caused your liver to become sick.  
The more you drink, the sicker your liver is going to get and 
the more likely you will have another bleed.
.
It is also very important that you follow up in the liver clinic 
and with your primary care doctor.  You also are scheduled for 
for a colonoscopy and upper endoscopy on ___ a 
8 AM in the ___ building, third floor.
.
We made the following changes to your medications:
START Lactulose 30 ml as needed for when you are confused
