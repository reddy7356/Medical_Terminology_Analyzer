Brief Hospital Course:
A&P: ___ w/ AS s/p bioprosthetic valve, CKD, HTN p/w melena and
anemia secondary to lower GI bleeding.  

# Acute GI bleeding
# Acute blood loss anemia
Pt has known history of hemorrhoids and diverticulosis.  She was 
admitted to the hospitalist service and seen by GI.  She was 
started on Protonix 40mg IV BID initially since there was 
concern that there could be an upper source.  When it was 
determined that lower was more likely, this was stopped.  She 
had a colonoscopy which showed severe diverticulosis, grade 3 
non-bleeding internal hemorrhoids, and rectal prolapse.  Her 
bleeding resolved.  She initially had Hgb of 11.2 and got as low 
as 7.5.  She received Ferric gluconate 125mg IV x2 and will go 
home on oral iron.  Her Aspirin was held on admission but 
restarted on discharge.  

#Thrombocytopenia - new problem, unclear etiology.  This could 
be
consumptive since she has bleeding and clots.  She was never on 
heparin.  We ordered an abdominal U/S to see if she has hemato 
or splenomegaly, but this was normal.  It may have ___ caused by 
the PPI.  She can see her PCP next week to discuss what if any 
additional steps may be necessary.

#Occlusive superficial vein thrombosis of the mid and distal 
right cephalic vein with overlying cellulitis - this was from an 
area where an IV was placed.  She started Keflex ___ PO q6 for 
a total of 7 days ___ - ___.  She was advised to use heat 
packs to help with absorption as well as Tylenol if she had any 
pain.  
  
___ on CKD III: Cr 1.4 from baseline perhaps closer to 1.1.  
This was secondary to dehydration and now resolved. 

#AS s/p bioprosthetic valve: Restarted Aspirin 325mg PO daily on 
discharge. 

#HTN: On arrival to the hospital, her blood pressures were 
elevated, but she was also having hemorrhagic anemia.  ___ 
admitting MD fractionated her home diltiazem, uptitrated to 90 
q6 (typically 240) with careful holding parameters and held HCTZ 
25mg, losartan 100mg, and atenolol 150mg. Her systolic blood 
pressures on this were consistently 100s-120s.  She was 
discharged on her home Diltiazem and HCTZ, but Atenolol and 
Losartan were held.  She was advised to take daily blood 
pressure readings to discuss with her PCP as to whether to 
restart either of these medications.  

#GOC: ___ admitting MD, "Pt stated she was previously DNR based
on prior conversations with family. This evening she also
expressed her sentiment that she would also not want to be
intubated, even if
there was a chance for meaningful recovery. There seems to be
some lingering confusion amongst family (esp with pts dtr/HCP)
that stems from end of life discussions with pts husband that
intubation commits a patient to permanent respiratory support
without the possibility for extubation despite multiple
conversations with them this evening. The patients main goal is
to maintain her current independent life-style (pt lives alone 
in
a 2 story house and is independent for ADLs/AIDLs)."
Pt currently DNR/DNI

#Chronic back pain: Tylenol as needed

right 
cephalic vein

 
Discharge Condition:
Mental Status: Clear and coherent.

Activity Status: Ambulatory - Independent.

 
Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted to the hospital with anemia from GI bleeding.  
You had a colonoscopy which showed that you had diverticulosis 
(small outpouchings of the colon which can lead to bleeding) as 
well as internal hemorrhoids.  Your bleeding stopped, and you 
are able to go home with iron pills.  Of note, some of your 
blood pressure medicines were held, and you can restart them as 
needed after a discussion with your PCP. 

Please take your blood pressure once or twice a day and write it 
down on one piece of paper.  Please bring this paper to your PCP 
to discuss if you should restart these medicines.  

You also unfortunately developed a skin infection from the area 
where your IV was and a superficial blood clot there too.  
Please use heat packs and Tylenol if the area is uncomfortable, 
and finish your antibiotics.  If you develop difficulty 
breathing or pain with breathing, you should seek urgent medical 
attention.  

Of note, you also had low platelets, which are the part of your 
blood that affects clotting.  This may be caused by your body 
using them because of the bleeding or because of one of the 
medicines we used out of concern for stomach bleeding 
(Protonix).  Your PCP ___ need to recheck this and advise you 
if any additional steps are needed.  
We wish you the best in your recovery,
Your ___ team
