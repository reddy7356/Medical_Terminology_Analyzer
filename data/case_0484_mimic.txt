her pain as the following: dull in character, recurrent, lasting

pain and associated shaking chills. Additional review of systems 
is notable for nausea, vomiting, and loose stools x 1. She was 
initially seen at an OSH where she was febrile to 102.4. OSH RUQ 
US demonstrated common bile duct dilatation. She received levo 
and vanco and was then transferred here for ERCP evaluation. 
Recent procedures include colonoscopy, EGD, and CT Abdomen 
within the last ___ weeks which demonstrated condyloma 
acuminatum, ovarian cyst, and tiny renal cysts.  

Upon arrival to the ED, temp 99, HR 95, BP 106/68, RR 16, and 
pulse ox 95% on room air. Exam was notable for RUQ tenderness. 
Labs were notable for transaminitis with ALT 641, AST 789, Alk 
Phos 180, and WBC 10.2. RUQ US demonstrated minimal distal 
common bile duct prominence. She received zofran 2mg IV x 1, 
dilaudid 1mg IV x 1, and flagyl. She was evaluated by ERCP and 
surgery who recommended ERCP in the AM.

OSH MICROBIOLOGY: 

OSH STUDIES: 
___ ECG - sinus tachycardia at ~ 100 bpm, normal axis, no ST 
changes

___ Transabdominal and transvaginal Pelvic ultrasound - 
complex right ovarian cyst. NO evidence of torsion or other 
specific complication. Recommend follow-up evaluation in 6 weeks 
to assess resolution

___ Abdominal US 
1. s/p cholecystectomy with interval dilatation of the common 
bile duct from 5mm to 9mm, nonspecific. Possibility of 
underlying choledocholithiasis is difficult to exclude
2. Small right renal cyst

___ Colonoscopy
1. Mild internal hemorrhoids
2. Few small condylomata found. Biopsy with cold forceps was 
performed for histology
3. Terminal ileum was normal

___ Anus biopsy - fragmented severe anal intraepithelial 
neoplasia arising in a condyloma acuminatum

___ EGD - normal

___ CT Abd/Pelvis with contrast - visualized lung bases 
appear clear; mild intrahepatic ductal dilatation. Common bile 
duct measures 8mm which is not unexpected for a patient who is 
s/p cholecystectomy. tiny hypodnsities in the right kidney which 
are too small to definitely characterize but are likely due to 
cysts; multiloculated cystic structure within the right 
posterior adnexa which measures 7.2cm by 4.9cm
.
ERCP:
Evidence of a previous biliary sphincterotomy that had stenosed 
was noted in the major papilla.  
A periampullary diverticulum was found at the major papilla. 
Cannulation of the biliary duct was successful and deep with a 
sphincterotome using a free-hand technique. Contrast medium was 
injected resulting in complete opacification.  
A single 3-4mm stone that was causing partial obstruction was 
seen at the lower third of the common bile duct. A biliary 
sphincterotomy was performed successfully in the 12 o'clock 
position using a sphincterotome over an existing guidewire.  
The stone and sludge was extracted successfully using a balloon 
catheter. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ yo female with history of cholecystectomy was admitted with 
likely cholangitis. 

1. Cholangitis, Choledocholithiasis with obstruction:  Patient 
was kept NPO with IV fluids.  Her symptoms stabilized and she 
underwent ERCP which showed a 3-4mm stone in the CBD which was 
extracted, with sphincterotomy.  She was initially maintained on 
unasyn.  Her transaminitis improved as did her symptoms.  
Surgery did not feel surgical intervention was necessary.  
Amylase and lipase were normal.  Her diet was advanced 
successfully and she was discharged to complete an additional 5 
day course of Augmentin with close PCP follow up.
.
2. Ovarian Cyst: Patient had evidence of loculated ovarian cyst 
for which 6 week follow-up imaging was recommended. 
 
 
Medications on Admission:
1. Dicylomine prn pain

1. Prilosec 20 mg Capsule, Delayed Release(E.C.) Sig: One (1) 
Capsule, Delayed Release(E.C.) PO twice a day.

bile duct that was removed.  Your symptoms and blood work 
improved.  You will be discharged to complete a course of 
antibiotics Augmentin, for 5 more days.
.
Please take all medications as prescribed.  It is very important
