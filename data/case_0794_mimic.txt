IMAGING
-------
Chest X-ray on admission: IMPRESSION: Right perihilar hazy 
opacity which may reflect asymmetric pulmonary edema, but 
infection also is in the differential. Small bilateral pleural 
effusions. Limited evaluation of the right lung apex. 
.
CT head on admission:
1. No acute intracranial process.  
2. Near-complete opacification of the bilateral mastoid air 
cells, unchanged on the left, but new on the right.   
3. Increased size and number of lucencies within the calvaria 
should be 
correlated clinically with any history of malignancy, and a bone 
scan can be obtained for further evaluation. This finding was 
communicated to Dr. ___ by Dr. ___ at 12:20 a.m. via 
telephone on ___.   
4. Extensive paranasal sinus disease, as described above.   
5. Extensive chronic small vessel ischemic disease, not 
significantly changed compared to ___. 
.
CXR ___: 
As compared to the previous radiograph, there is increased 
parenchymal opacity in the right perihilar lung areas. Although 
unilateral pulmonary edema would be more likely than pneumonia, 
pneumonia cannot be excluded on grounds of the radiologic 
appearance.  Unchanged size of the cardiac silhouette. Unchanged 
vascular stent. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ year old ___ male with poorly controlled HIV (last CD4 
count 273 in ___, in-house level 52), HBV coinfection and a 
history of longstanding peritoneal dialysis who presented ___ 
with mental status change, hypotension, and hypothermia.
.
ACTIVE ISSUES
-------------
# Pneumonia: community acquired pneumonia vs. PCP pneumonia, 
patient is on prophylactic Bactrim at home.  He presented with 
hypothermia and altered mental status.  CD4 count was noted to 
be 52.  Patient was initially on vancomycin/zosyn for empiric 
coverage, then switched to PO moxifloxacin for planned five day 
course after blood cultures remained negative.   Chest X-ray 
showed perihilar opacity.  Patient will continue bactrim 
prophylaxis upon discharge.  Sputum cultures were obtained but 
were contaminated.  Infectious disease was consulted and 
recommended the above antibiotic therapy, as well as continuing 
prophylactic Bactrim.
.
# HIV: CD4 count measured at 52 during admission, viral load 88 
copies.  Patient was continued on his home HAART regimen, as 
well as prophylactic Bactrim.  Patient will likely require 
re-evaluation of his HAART regimen upon discharge.
.
# Pancytopenia: patient was noted to be pancytopenic during his 
hospital stay, and it is unclear if this is chronic.  This may 
be related to his HIV, or other etiology, however this was not 
worked up further due to patient's insistence to be transferred 
to ___.
.
# Bradycardia: on ___ patient had a pause on telemetry (8 
seconds) with transient hypotension to the ___ and hypoxia to 
the ___ which recovered within seconds.  Later in the evening he 
had two episodes of bradycardia to the high ___ which was 
self-limited within seconds and asymptomatic.  Electrolytes, 
cardiac enzymes and EKG were within normal limits; a cardiology 
consult was obtained and no further evaluation or intervention 
was recommended.
.
# Head imaging abnormality: patient was noted to have lucencies 
in the calvarium on head CT.  This was not worked up further due 
to patient's insistence to be transferred to ___.
.
# End-stage renal disease on peritoneal dialysis: patient 
presented with concern for peritoneal dialysis port site 
infection, with purulent fluid coming from the site.  Cultures 
were obtained via diagnostic paracentesis and were preliminarily 
negative upon discharge.  Patient is on Calcitriol 0.5 and 
sinacalcet 150 mg daily.  Renal was consulted for performance of 
peritoneal dialysis while patient was hospitalized.  CBC should 
be trended for further signs of infection. 
.
# Anemia: likely combination of bone marrow suppression as well 
as chronic kidney disease.  The patient recieved one unit RBCs 
for Hct 22.9 with an appropriate bump to 26.9.  Epoeitin was 
held given concern for possible malignancy on head CT.
.
INACTIVE ISSUES
---------------
# Hypertension: patient is on lisinopril and amolodipine at 
home.  His home blood pressure medications were resumed after 
they were initially held due to his presenting sepsis-like 
picture.
.  
TRANSITION OF CARE
------------------
# Follow-up: patient will be discharged to ___ per 
his request.  Patient will require antibiotics to finish course 
of antibiotics for community acquired pneumonia.  Blood cultures 
and peritoneal cultures are currently pending and will need to 
be followed up.  There was also concern for malignancy of CT 
head that will need to be followed up.  This was not addressed 
during the ___ hospital stay given his refusal for further 
work-up.  He should receive CBC and Chem10 every day for 
monitoring.  Epoietin is being held at the current time due to 
the concern for malignancy on CT head.  This should be 
re-evaluated in the near future.
. 
# Code status: presumed full
.
# CONTACT: patient, ___ (___) ___ 
.

History of Present Illness:
Mr. ___ is a ___ year-old male with HIV, Hepatitis B/C, ESRD 
on peritoneal dialysis who presented to the ED with abdominal 
pain, constipation and also feeling dizzy with lightheadedness.  
Called the ambulance for these symptoms.  Initial VS 91.1F 
orally, HR 72, BP initially unmeasurable, RR 20 and 100% oxygen 
saturation on room air.  Exam with clear lungs, RRR, distended 
abdomen which was soft and full.  He refused a rectal exam.  CT 
was obtained given abdominal pain and preliminary read was 
negative for any acute intrabdominal processes.  Right femoral 
line was placed with some difficulty due to scar tissue.  BP 
remained difficult to assess given severe vascular disease.  
Repeat VS soon after presentation revealed temperature 96.1F, 
75HR, BPs of 59/25-105/47, RR 12, and oxygen saturation was 100% 
room air.  Fingerstick glucose was 123.  Patient had potassium 
repleted with 40 mEq K in 1L NS, with 3 additional L NS.  His 
peritoneal dialysate was sampled and did not reveal evidence of 
infection.  Denies ever having abdominal pain, but more a sense 
of constipation and "fullness".  Systolic blood pressures in ED 
ranged 74--> 68 --> 90 --> 105.  By time of transfer from ED to 
inpatient setting he was saturating well on RA, eating and 
requesting more food. Given patient's initial presentation of 
appearing very unwell, was sent to the ICU for closer 
monitoring.

Upon arrival in the ICU, denied any complaints except a sense of 
constipation in his abdomen. Upon ROS, patient denied associated 
nausea, vomiting, fevers, chills, dizziness,dysuria, rash, 
dyspnea. Confirms he had decreased oral intake for 4 days in the 
setting of his constipation and has taken an unknown medication 
for his constipation in the past.  Also with partial blindness 
which is his baseline.  States he had one episode of chest pain 
on day before admission but this improved with sugar as provided 
in the ED.  Denies any exertional component or pain radiation.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ is a ___ year-old male with HIV, Hep B/C, ESRD on 
peritoneal dialysis who presented with abdominal pain x 1 day, 
hypothermia, and hypotension which resolved status-post IVFs.  

Brief MICU Course:

The patient was admitted to the MICU for close observation, 
although his symptoms of abdominal pain had resolved. His blood 
pressure did drop to as low as ___ systolic, and he received 2 L 
NS, and was started on Levophed. He was cultured and covered 
empirically with Vanco/Zosyn given the hypotension and this was 
later narrowed to Zosyn alone. He was hypothermic to 92 degrees 
rectally, and a Bair Hugger was applied. Peritoneal Dialysis was 
attempted but terminated early given the hypotension. Blood 
pressure readings were inconsistent so an a-line was placed. 
Over the course of hospital day 1, the patient's hemodynamics 
improved and the Levophed was weaned off. TSH and cortisol 
levels were normal. Throughout this, the patient mentated well 
and was A&Ox3. On Hospital Day 2 he was called out to the 
regular medical floor from the ICU for ongoing monitoring. 
Please see below for problem based summary after transfer to 
general medical wards. 

Continued course after transfer out of ICU to medical floor:

# Abdominal Discomfort: Continued to deny any active abdominal 
pain after hospital day 2. Bloated from constipation on 
admission but he had multiple bowel movements with relief of his 
sense of "fullness" soon after admission. Oral intake improved 
daily. Exam revealed a soft, NT abdomen. No noted organisms in 
peritoneal culture; all cultures NTD thus far, finals pending. 
Initially had elevated lactate, but this resolved. CT abdomen 
essentially clear with exception of cirrhosis and ascites and 
some kidney findings as outlined below. Probably dehydration 
from admitted poor PO intake promoted constipation. He was 
monitored with serial abdominal exams. Aggressive bowel regimen 
with Senna and lactulose given for regularity of bowel 
movements. 
.
# Hypothermia / Hypotension: Low blood pressures have 
stabilized. Still unclear etiology, although likely from his 
poor PO intake and some mild dehydration.  Changes in body 
temperature unlikely endocrinologic in nature as initial 
cortisol and TSH were within normal limits, repeat a.m. cortisol 
added on ___ and was also WNL. Some of his borderline low blood 
pressure shifts may be due to small amount of volume changes 
with dialysis treatments as well (although PD not HD). Initial 
infectious workup labs/studies for concerns over looming 
SIRS/sepsis picture have all been unremarkable to date. History 
of HIV, HepC, HepB. Latest CD-4 count=273. Leukopenias initially 
concerning for an acute infection but as he appeared markedly 
more stable after IVFs and all culture data was unrevealing it 
was felt hat his low blood cell counts were more likely due to 
his HIV. Anuric so no urine studies collected. Trended 
temperatures, improved after he was transferred to the medical 
floor from the ICU. However, he is still having some more 
intermittent low temperatures in the ___ range with oral 
measures. He had a CT head without contrast on the morning of 
___ to rule out of any hypothamalmic masses/CVAs that may have 
impacted his ability to self regulate body temperature. Head CT 
showed no definite acute intracranial process, and relatively 
symmetric, confluent low-attenuation in bihemispheric 
periventricular white matter, most likely representing chronic
