1.  Relatively featureless dilated loop of small bowel in the

Brief Hospital Course:
This is a ___ year old female that presented to the emergency 
room  with abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting, leukocytosis, 
and diffuse abdominal tenderness without overt peritonitis.  She 
was admitted to the Acute Care Service after CT Scan imaging 
revealed concern for mesenteric and mural edema in a loop of 
ileum in the RLQ. The patient was MRE to help differentiate the 
etiology for the concerning loop of bowel, however she could not 
tolerate the procedure. She was kept NPO, received IV fluids and 
had serial abdominal exams. ESR and CRP labs were drawn at the 
time of admission. Stool studies were ordered however the 
patient did not have a bowel movement prior to discharge; she 
was passing flatus. 

The patient was discharged on ___ after her exam improved 
and she was tolerating a regular diet without experiencing 
nausea or vomiting. Her lab values were all within normal limits 
except for a slightly elevated CRP in light of inflammation. A 
followup appointment with a new Primary Care Physican was 
scheduled to take place within 1 week of discharge, and the 
patient was given the ___ clinic's information in case she 
experienced any new symptoms after discharge.
