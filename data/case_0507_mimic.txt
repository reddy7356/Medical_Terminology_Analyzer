Pertinent Results:
Cardiac Cath:
1. Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system
demonstrated three vessel disease. The LMCA had 80% distal 
lesion. The
LAD had a 70% proximal stenosis. The LCX had no significant 
disease. The
ramus was a moderate caliber vessel with no signicant disease. 
The RCA
had a mid ulcerated lesion with < 50% disease, sequential mid 
60%
stenosis and 80% ostial PDA.
2. Limited resting hemodynamics revelaed mildly left ventricular
diastolic dysfunction with LVEDP 17 mmHg. There was mild 
systemic
arterial hypertension at the central aortic level 157/70 mmHg. 
There was
no gradient across the aortic valve after careful pullback.
3. Left ventriculography was deferred.
 
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:    
1. Left main disease and two vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Mild left ventricular diastolic dysfunction.
3. No aortic stenosis.

ECHO
The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left 
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and 
regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular 
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic root is 
mildly dilated at the sinus level. The ascending aorta is mildly 
dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but 
aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. 
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no 
mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. 
The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. 
There is no pericardial effusion.'

IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with 
preserved global and regional biventricular systolic function. 
Mild mitral regurgitation.  

Carotid Ulrasound
Impression: Right ICA with  40-59%  stenosis.
Left ICA with <40%  stenosis.

Chest Xray:
No evidence of acute disease.

K-4.1 Cl-104 HCO3-26 AnGap-___ with past medical history of HTN and HLD presented to ___ 
for cardiac cath following positive outpatient stress test. 
Cardiac cath showed newly diagnosed three vessel disease 
including an 80% distal Left main lesion. Patient was admitted 
to the cardiology service for medical optimization prior to 
planned coronary artery bypass grafting. The cardiac surgery 
service was consulted for evaluation and Mr. ___ was worked-up 
in the usual preoperative manner. He received carvedilol, 
aspirin, and atorvastatin for CAD medical optimization. An Echo 
showed left ventricular hypertrophy with good systolic function. 
A carotid ultrasound showed mild to moderate bilateral internal 
carotid artery stenosis. On ___, ___ was taken to the 
operating room where he underwent coronary artery bypass 
grafting x4 (___->lad/ SVG->Ramus/RCA/PDA). Please see 
operative note for further details. He tolerated the procedure 
well and he was transferred to the CVICU. He required pressor 
support for optimal hemodynamics. He later woke neurologicaly 
intact and was extubated without difficulty. He had NSVT and was 
placed on Amiodarone intravenously. The ectopy resolved and 
Amiodarone was converted to oral.  He weaned off phenylephrine 
and Beta-blocker/Statin/ASA and diuresis were initiated. Chest 
tubes and pacing wires were discontinued per protocol without 
difficulty. On postoperative day one, he was transferred to the 
step down unit for further recovery. On PO4 he went into a rapid 
atrial fibrillation which converted to sinus rhythm.  His beta 
blocker was increased, he continued on oral Amiodarone and he 
was started on Coumadin for paroxsymal atrial fibrillation. When 
he did go into atrial fibrillation, he was rate controlled.  The 
physical therapy service was consulted for evaluation of 
strength and mobility. He continued to progress and on ___ 
was cleared for discharge to home on POD 6. All follow up 
appointments were advised.
