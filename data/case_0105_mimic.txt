RADIOLOGY RESULTS:

CT HEAD:
Small focus of hemorrhage in the superior right frontal lobe, 
likely resulting from the fall.

MRI/MRA:
1. Two small foci of intraparenchymal hemorrhage are 
redemonstrated in the superior right frontal lobe with minimal 
surrounding edema. Tiny sliver of left frontal subdural hematoma 
and possible tiny amount of hemorrhage layering along the 
anterior falx. These findings are again consistent with trauma.
2. No evidence of venous sinus thrombosis, although the current 
study is not sensitive for cortical venous thrombosis.

CXR:
No acute cardiopulmonary process

ECHO:
The left atrium is elongated. No atrial septal defect is seen by 
2D or color Doppler. There is mild symmetric left ventricular 
hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. 
Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal. Overall left 
ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). There is no 
left ventricular outflow obstruction at rest or with Valsalva. 
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. 
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets 
(3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and 
no aortic regurgitation. There is no aortic valve stenosis. The 
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral 
valve prolapse. Torn/redundant mitral chordae are present with 
the appearance of chordal systolic anterior motion/septal 
contact (non-obstructive). No mitral regurgitation is seen. 
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. The estimated pulmonary 
artery systolic pressure is normal. There is no pericardial 
effusion. 

IMPRESSION: Redundant/torn mitral chordae with mitral valve 
chordal ___ (non-obstructive). Normal biventricular systolic 
function. No LVOT obstruction at rest or with Valsalva.  
 
Brief Hospital Course:
Given his symptoms, Mr ___ was admitted for concern of syncope 
___ vascular event such as venous sinus thrombosis or seizure.  
He had a normal CXR. 
A head CT in the ED showed the following: In the superior right 
frontal lobe, there is a 5 x 3 mm focus of hemorrhage (2:25). 
There is minimal surrounding edema. There is no mass effect or 
midline shift upon the right lateral ventricle. A second, 
possibly contiguous adjacent focus of hemorrhage (2:24) is even 
smaller. No other foci of hemorrhage identified. No fracture or 
superficial hemorrhage is identified. The ventricles and sulci 
are normal in caliber and configuration. 

To better evaluate the vasculature, he had an MRI/MRA/MRV, which 
showed the following: Two small foci of intraparenchymal 
hemorrhage are redemonstrated in the superior right frontal lobe 
with minimal surrounding edema. In addition, there is a tiny 
amount of blood layering along the left frontal lobe consistent 
with a subdural hematoma. Linear region of increased FLAIR 
signal along the anterior falx may also represent a tiny sliver 
of subdural hematoma. This findings were consistent with head 
trauma ___ fall. Mild periventricular hypodensities are likely 
due to chronic small vessel ischemic disease. Mucosal thickening 
in ethmoid air cells likely relate to chronic sinus disease; the 
remainder of the visualized paranasal sinuses and mastoid air 
cells appear well aerated. Normal vascular flow voids are 
demonstrated. No abnormal T1 signal is seen to indicate cortical 
venous thrombosis. The intracranial vertebral and internal 
carotid arteries and their major branches appear normal, without 
evidence of stenosis, occlusion, or aneurysm formation.

In addition, he underwent an EEG to r/o seizure, which revealed 
no epileptiform changes and no areas of focal slowing.

He also underwent an LP which showed a Protein 52, Glucose 79, 
WBC 3 and RBC 1325 consistent with his recent ICH.  CSF Gram 
stain and cultures showed no organisms.  Blood cultures were 
pending at time of discharge.  He remains afebrile without 
leukocytosis.

He remained hemodynamically stable throughout his hospital 
course, and did not have any seizure-type activity.  His cardiac 
enzymes were negative x 3 ruling out MI, and his CPK continued 
to trend down.  In addition, his telemetry remained in sinus 
rhythm. An EKG on admission was significant for sinus 
bradycardia and diffuse ST changes, perhaps suggestive of 
pericarditis.  AM fasting fingerstick glucose levels were 
abnormally high at 134 and 122.  In addition, his HbA1c was 
found to be 6.1  and his fasting lipid profile revealed and LDL 
of 108.

He was evaluated by the Cardiology service given concern that 
his syncope was less consistent with seizure, and seemed to be 
more cardiac in origin. An Trans-thoracic ECHO revealed: The 
left atrium is elongated. There is mild symmetric left 
ventricular hypertrophy. Overall left ventricular systolic 
function is normal (LVEF>55%). There is no left ventricular 
outflow obstruction at rest or with Valsalva. The ascending 
aorta is mildly dilated. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly 
thickened. Torn/redundant mitral chordae are present with the 
appearance of chordal systolic anterior motion/septal contact 
(non-obstructive).  Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. There 
is no pericardial effusion. IMPRESSION: Redundant/torn mitral 
chordae with mitral valve chordal ___ (non-obstructive). Normal 
biventricular systolic function. No LVOT obstruction at rest or 
with Valsalva.  
The Cardiology service recommended outpatient Holter monitoring, 
a trans-esophageal ECHO, and increasing ASA to 325mg PO QD.

At time of discharge, he was in stable condition, and reported 
being able to ambulate without lightheadedness, but was 
counseled to exercise caution with exertion. He was also 
counseled to hold his home regimen of aspirin for one week due 
to his recent ICH. He will follow-up with his PCP and Dr. 
___ in Neurology ___.
