RELEVANT IMAGING
===============
KG: NSR 77 BPM, normal axis, QTC 453, no sig ST changes from
prior

TTE ___
The left atrium is normal in size. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or color Doppler. The estimated right atrial pressure
is ___ mmHg. Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size
are normal. Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal. 
Left
ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%). The
estimated cardiac index is high (4.0L/min/m2). Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The diameters of
aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels are normal. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. There is no
valvular aortic stenosis. The increased transaortic velocity is
likely related to high cardiac output. No aortic regurgitation 
is
seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is 
no
mitral valve prolapse. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is 
no
pericardial effusion. 
IMPRESSION: Hyperdynamic left ventricular systolic function. No
pathologic valvular flow.  

CXR ___
Conclusion: Cardiomegaly. Right mastectomy and axillary surgical
staples. Otherwise Normal AP view of the chest.  No active/acute
chest disease.

CT-A Chest ___
Conclusion:
1. No evidence of pulmonary emboli. Cardiomegaly, Question
minimal CHF, as noted. Possibly an element of air trapping.
2. Single indeterminate right medial base subpleural opacity.
Also a tiny 2 mm RML subpleural nodule. Consider short-term
follow-up in 6 months, alternatively compare with any available
priors. 
3. Right mastectomy. Other incidental findings as noted.

TTE ___ (DFCI)
The LV cavity size and wall thickness are normal. LV Sys fxn is
normal. There are no segmental Lt ventricular wall motion
abnormalities notes. The estimated EF is 65%. The estimated RV
sys pressure is 21mmHg assuming a RA pressure of 5. Compared to
prior study of ___, no important changes

cMRI ___
Asymmetric septal left ventricular hypertrophy with
small cavity and hyperdynamic systolic function. There is
evidence of systolic anterior movement of anterior mitral 
leaflet
and LVOT gradient at rest. Normal right ventricular cavity size
and free wall motion. Allowing for poor quality of post contrast
sequences, there is no definite late gadolinium enhancement. The
CMR findings are suggestive of hypertensive hypertrophic
cardiomyopathy of the elderly.

TDM1/pertuzumab, Rt total mastectomy & axillary LN dissection in 
___, now on C1 CMF) who p/w prog intermittent episodes of 
diaphoresis, palpitations, chest pressure to ___, found to 
have PMVT, transferred to ___ for further w/u, mild CAD 
detected on Lt heart cath, cMRI suggestive of hypertrophic 
cardiomyopathy, s/p EP evaluation w/ICD placement

-CORONARIES: LAD, LCX mild disease

# Polymorphic VT:
Pt with diff to describe episodes w/increasing frequency at 
home, found to have recurrent PMVT at ___, including 
during episode, started on amio gtt and transferred to ___. 
Episodes had been ongoing for many months, though worsening in 
recent days prior to admission. Trigger for PMVT is broad DDx, 
including initiation of recent chemo, past TDM1/Pertuzumab 
administration, lytes abnormality from chemo-related GI Sx, 
Zofran use. On arrival here, pt continued to have several very 
short episodes of PMVT induced by PVCs. Started on PO Dilt for 
potential coronary vasospasm & amio gtt DC'd. Ischemic workup 
neg via LHC, showed mild LCx/LAD Dz. TTE showed mild resting 
LVOT + ___ of MV leaflets, mild symmetric LVH, hyperdynamic 
LVEF. Cardiac MRI showing signs of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, 
w/o scar. After much discussion, EP recommended iCD placement in 
setting of cMRI findings and recurrent PMVT. Was also restarted 
on PO Amiodarone, started on 400 TID w/plan for taper as outpt.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms ___,

You were admitted to ___ after you were found to have an 
abnormal and potentially dangerous heart rhythm at ___. We 
had our electrophysiologists evaluate you after you had a 
cardiac catheterization that was negative. You had a cardiac MRI 
which showed that your heart wasn't pumping properly due to 
being abnormally thickened -- "Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy". 
After some discussion, we decided it was most safe to place an 
ICD. We also started you on a new medication, called Amiodarone, 
to help prevent further dangerous heart rhythms from forming. 
Please take it at home as prescribed.

It was a pleasure taking care of you!

Your ___ Cardiology Team
