Brief Hospital Course:
Course Summary
This is a ___ year old male with a past medical history of sickle 
cell anemia, chronic pain on high dose oral opiates admitted 
___ with chest pain and back pain consistent with prior 
pain crises, treated conservatively with IV fluids, pain 
control, incentive spirometry, oxygen, as well as empiric 
antibiotics and pRBC transfusion in setting of initial concern 
for acute chest syndrome, who rapidly improved with respect to 
pain and hypoxia on the day of discharge, requested discharge 
home with prescriptions to deal with a family illness, 
discharged with planned outpatient follow-up.

# Sickle Cell Pain Crisis - patient was admitted with acute on 
chronic chest and back pain, worsening over the course of 
several days; labs were notable for an elevated reticulocyte 
count (peaked at 13.9) and elevated indirect bilirubin.  He was 
started on IV fluids, oxygen, prn IV pain control per pain plan 
described in detail in prior notes, but summarized here "IV 
dilaudid 4mg Q4H:PRN pain, IV tylenol 
___ TID standing, hot packs to apply to affected joints. If 
persistent pain, can add on 3 day course of IV ketorolac 30mg q8 
standing. If patient still in pain, can increase interval of IV 
dilaudid to Q3, and would not further escalate opioid regimen. 
Once patient tolerating food, should be transitioned back to 
equivalent doses of oral oxycodone, and can taper down daily to 
home regimen. Do NOT offer ketamine drip (possible cause of 
previous bradycardia during a prior admission)."  Patient was 
seen by hematology consult and there was much discussion and 
uncertainty regarding presence/absence of Acute Chest Syndrome 
in setting of hypoxia.  He underwent a CT chest that showed 
possible acute chest, which prompted antibiotics and transfusion 
of a total of 4 units pRBCs.  Symptoms subsequently improved and 
no exchange transfusion was pursued.  On day of discharge, he 
went from being inactive 
due to reported pain and use of a facemask for comfortable 
breathing (per nursing report he would refuse to take it off for 
vitals), to announcing he would stop supplemental oxygen and IV 
pain medications and go home due to family illness.  He did not 
desaturate and ambulated comfortably down the hallway with use 
of crutches (his reported baseline).  He completed his 5 day 
course of empiric antibiotics prior to discharge.  Per 
discussion with his PCP and pain team, patient discharged with 7 
day supply of home pain  medication (OxycoDONE 30mg PO Q5-6H:PRN 
pain #42), with long-term plan for weaning pain medications.  
Continued home hydroxyurea although he frequently refused during 
the admission.  Restarted home folate, exjade at discharge

# Difficult behavior - patient frequently requested uptitration 
of his pain regimen, despite knowledge of prior harm from it 
(bradycardia secondary to ketamine); he also refused lovenox 
despite knowledge of risk of VTE.  He also demonstrated rapid 
recovery from reporting multiple symptoms on the morning of his 
day of discharge.  He required close coordination of his care to 
ensure all providers/consultants were working together and had a 
uniform plan.  

# Constipation - continued home Colace, and per patient's 
specific request, provided with a prescription for prn bisacodyl 
at discharge

# Chronic Nausea - continued home promethazine

# Anxiety - did not provide prescription for alprazolam at 
discharge

Brief Hospital Course:
___ PMH of Sickle Cell Disease, Opiate dependence, who presents 
c/o acute pain crisis, and was admitted to medicine for pain 
control
  
#Pain Crisis:  Unclear etiology. Possibly ___ sickle crisis, but 
only 1+ on smear, no schistocytes, Hgb at baseline. ___ be 
precipitated by poor PO in previous 2 days prior to admission 
secondary to nausea. URI possible in the week prior given sore 
throat, but no remaining sx now. UA negative for UTI. CXR 
negative for pneumonia. Other possibilities include non sickle 
pain including, too rapid downtitration of opiates, or 
psychosocial factors including anxiety ___ patients and his 
mother's illness). ___ Pain Service was consulted. Per their 
recs started patient on ketamine infusion at 12 mg/hour and IV 
dialudid 3 mg q3 hours. On day 3 ketamine infusion was decrased 
to 10 mg/hour due to ectopy, and dilaudid dose was increased to 
4 mg IV q2 hours. This dilaudid dose was the max dose that was 
given to the patient and was only given for 1 day. During this 
period patient was also given standing toradol 30 mg IV x4 days 
and prn ativan for agitation associated with ketamine. On day 4, 
IV dilaudid was downtritated as was ketamine infusion. On day 5 
all IV pain medications were discontinued and plan was to change 
to PO. Of note, during his stay patient stated he was unable to 
tolerate POs, however partially eaten trays of food were noted 
in room, and he repeatedly refused IV anti-emetics offered by 
nursing staff, concerning for IV opioid seeking behavior. When 
he was informed of the change to PO pain meds, he informed us 
that the was leaving. Patient was discharged with 1 week 
prescription for sixty 30 mg tablets of oxycodone ___ per day) 
which was his pre-admission opiod regimen. 

#Sickle Cell Anemia:  Pt is at baseline Hgb of ~8. Asplenic at 
birth so no risk for infarction.  Hemolysis labs with hapto < 5 
and elevated LDH.  Patient was seen by hematology team.  H/H 
remained stable throughout.  He was given maintenance IV fluids. 
 He was continued on his home Hydroxyurea.    

#Opiate Dependence: Pt reports hx of failing multiple outpt 
regimens including fentanyl patch, MS contin, ___ 
currently being downtitrated for fear of dependence by outpt PCP 
(Dr. ___. Home dose 30mg oxycodone q3h (60 tabs per week). 
 Chronic pain service followed as noted above.  Patient's 
inpatient IV regimen was with dilaudid (max dose was 4mg IV q2 
hours for 1 day), toradol and ketamine as noted above.  Patient 
discharged on outpatient oxycodone regimen.

#Iron Overload: Exjade is non-formulary, held medication while 
in house

REPORTS
=======
___ CXR
Mild peribronchial infiltration, similar to multiple prior 
exams, is likely residue of recent edema or early developing 
edema. No focal consolidation or evidence of acute chest 
syndrome. 
 
Brief Hospital Course:
This is a ___ year old male with a past medical history of sickle 
cell anemia, complicated by asplenia, femoral avascular 
necrosis, admitted ___ with acute pain crisis manifested 
as chest pain and nausea / vomiting, ruled out for acute chest, 
treated supportively per his inpatient pain crisis protocol with 
significant improvement, who requested  discharge home and then 
left AMA before safe discharge planning could be completed.  

# Sickle Cell Anemia / Sickle Cell Pain Crisis - Patient 
presented with worsening chest pain, back pain, and joint pain 
as well as nausea and reported pruritis. CXR in ED without 
evidence of acute chest or other acute process. EKG and cardiac 
biomarkers were within normal limits. The patient was without 
fever or localizing signs to suggest infection. The patient's 
pain, nausea/vomiting, and opiate-associated pruritus was 
treated according to his Inpatient Acute Pain Episode Protocol 
(see OMR note ___ for full documentation).  A 
multidisciplinary team meeting was held with the patient to 
emphasize this protocol.  The patient's labs including LDH, 
reticulocyte count, bilirubin were trended - all except 
bilirubin were improving at the time of discharge (Hb stable ~9, 
reticulocyte count downtrending from 10 to 7%). On the morning 
on ___, after reporting he was to nauseated to eat, he reported 
he wished to be discharged. In the setting of rising bilirubin 
to 3.7 and patient report of unimproved symptoms of pain and 
nausea, the medical team advised further discussion with care 
team and careful advancing of diet, as well as risks of leaving 
AMA including symptom worsening. The patient elected to leave 
AGAINST MEDICAL ADVICE (AMA).  The patient reported that he lost 
his most recent ___ narcotics prescriptions. After 
consultation with the patient's PCP, these prescriptions were 
reprinted for the patient. PCP ___ was scheduled for 
___ at 12noon. The patient's home PO hydroxyurea and folic 
acid were continued during this admission, but the patient 
refused these medications.  He was also ordered Lovenox for DVT 
prophylaxis, which he also refused.  He was placed on 2L 
continuous O2 and provided an incentive spirometer to prevent 
atelectasis. 

# Rhabdomyolysis - Patient with CK peaked at to 5425 on 
admission, likely secondary to mild muscle inflammation either 
as result of acute pain episode or a resolving viral infection 
that may have triggered the acute pain crisis.  This downtrended 
during this admission and normalized at the time of discharge. 

# Barriers to Care - Patient reported nausea during this 
admission, and inability to tolerate oral medications, but 
nursing had to remove a bag filled with candy and chips from his 
bedside, which he was attempting to eat; he frequently called 
his outpatient providers during the hospital stay; his treatment 
plan followed his Inpatient Acute Pain Episode Protocol (see OMR 
note ___ and team coordinated with outpatient providers to 
ensure unified message regarding treatment plan;

History of Present Illness:
Mr ___ is a ___ y/o M with sickle cell disease who presents 
with right arm pain, hip pain, vomitting, and decreased PO 
intake. 

Patient has recently transitioned care from ___ in the 
past to ___ since ___, including PCP, ___, and 
hematology. Since transitioning, his PCP has been ___ 
his ouptatient narcotic regimen (from 100-30mg oxycodone pills 
per week to 60-30mg oxycodone pills per week), and in this 
setting, the patient has had multiple recent hospitalizations 
for acute pain episodes, including one episode of acute chest 
syndrome. Most recent admission the patient left despite still 
having hip pain and feeling unwell, and now returns with similar 
complaints to prior 3 admissions, including hip/back/shoulder 
pain, nausea/vomiting and R groin pain, and now with new R 
arm/elbow pain.

Patient describes that most of his pain from the last three 
admissions is unchanged and not improved, including his typical 
sickle cell back, shoulder, hip pain, as well as L groin pain 
with tender LNs which has been stable since last admissions. He 
also notes recurrence of N/V and intolerance of anything PO for 
the last 4 days prior to admission, and new R arm/elbow joint 
pain preventing full extension for the last 2 days prior to 
admission. This new pain is what prompted his presentation to 
the ED. The pain is described as ___, without anything that 
relieves the pain. Pain in elbow worsened with extension, 
lessened in the flexed position. Denies any recent trauma. Notes 
a fever at home. He reports vomiting up anything he eats, 
without digesting, with bilious liquid and food particles, 
non-bloody. 

He has had 3 prior admissions since ___. 
-The first was at ___ for somnolence and concern for 
narcotics overdose which improved with narcan; he reported that 
he took xanax and a shot of alcohol, and was not abusing his 
pain medicine. 
-The second was ___ for pneumonia/acute chest syndrome. During 
this admission he had three blood transfusions with a 
transfusion threshold of 8 due to bradycardia secondary to 
decreased perfusion of the AV node in the setting of sickle cell 
exacerbation. Treated with cefpodoxime (stopped azithromycin due 
to prolonged QT)
-The most recent was ___ for a pain crisis, for which he was 
started on a ketamine drip, which was subsequently stopped as 
his pain management was tapered; he also had tender inguinal 
lymphadenopathy, during which a work-up for prostatitis, uti, 
and gonorrhea/chlamydia was negative, along with a negative MRI 
for any concerning areas of infection, and only mildly enlarged 
LNs.

ACTIVE ISSUES:
===================
# Sickle cell disease with acute pain episode:
Patient with history of SS disease, who recently established 
care with the ___ in ___ (pain service, hematology, and 
PCP). In the setting of his PCP ___ his pain regimen, 
he has had multiple recent hospitalizations for pain (3 
admissions since ___. This admission presenting with new 
elbow joint/surrounding forearm/upper arm pain, which is not 
usual location of pain, in addition to his chronic diffuse 
back/spinal/paraspinal pain and bilateral hip pain. Also with 
nausea/vomiting, reportedly unable to tolerate PO. Possible 
triggers include stress at home (takes care of mother with HIV), 
cold weather, vomiting/dehydration. Low suspicion for infection 
given negative CXR, no new foods, no sick contacts, though some 
burning with urination for weeks, UA/Urine cultures negative. 
Evidence of acute exacerbation of sickle cell disease consistent 
with acute pain episode, with increased retic count, increased 
LDH, and tbili, all of which improved with the treatments 
described below.
1) PAIN: Treated with IV dilaudid 4mg q3h PRN pain (NOT 
standing), and did not escalate dose given patient clinically 
remained very well appearing from admission, despite patient 
requests to escalte dose and frequency, and to add ketamine 
drip. Also treated with standing IV tylenol ___ q8, and 3 day 
course of IV ketorolac 30mg q8, per chronic pain service consult 
recommendations. Also given hot packs for joint pain relief as 
needed.
2) NAUSEA/VOMITING: Patient was initially NPO for his N/V, and 
kept on mIVF with NS at 200cc/hour, and though reported to the 
team and to nursing staff that he was unable to eat anything 
down on PO trials with food, did go to the vending machine 
overnight without evidence of vomiting, and was thought to be 
eating chips/snacks brought in from home. He takes PO 
promethazine at home, and was treated with IV promethazine and 
IV ativan for symptomatic nausea while hospitalized.
3) PRURITIS: Patient reported unbearable pruritis, requesting IV 
benadryl ___ with dilaudid infusions, however without any 
evidence of significant pruritis, no excoriations, and no hives. 
He was offered PO benadryl, however consistently vomited the 
pill or refused to try it.
4) SCD: Ordered for home medications, hydroxyurea and folic 
acid, however given patient was reporting intolerance to PO, he 
did not receive these medications while inpatient. Kept on 
continous O2 and incentive spirometry to avoid development of 
acute chest syndrome.
Patient's outpatient providers, Dr. ___, Dr. 
___ clinic), Dr. ___, were contacted via email 
to ensure treatment was adequate and all providers were in 
agreement with inpatient plan. Patient often contacts separately 
and tries to split providers. Protocol was developed this 
admission to prevent confusion with future acute pain episode 
admissions. This plan for developing a unified protocol was 
communicated to the patient.

# Groin Pain: Painful, palpable inguinal lymphadenopathy was 
worked up at prior hospitalization, and prostatitis, 
GC/chlamydia, and urine culture were negative. MRI last 
admission without evidence of acute infection/fluid 
collection/abscess, with mildly enlarged LNs without signs of 
surrounding inflammation. Patient continues to report stable 
dysuria. UA and urine culture were negative this admission, and 
patient was instructed to follow up with PCP and monitor for 
enlargement or worsening of LNs, with next possible step being 
biopsy.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
========================
# Supplied with 22 pills of 8mg dilaudid on discharge given 
insurance would not cover new prescription of oxycodone given he 
is not due until ___, per PCP who manages outpatient 
narcotics.
# Supplied with prescription, per his PCP, for home dose of 
oxycodone, to cover ___.
# Monitor R inguinal tender lymph nodes with PCP, recommend 
possible future biopsy if persistent or enlarging LNs.
# Code: Full
# Outpatient providers: PCP ___, MD 
___. Pain management: Dr ___ ___ 
# Emergency Contact: ___

=========================
Per discussion with patient's outpatient providers, Dr. ___ 
(___), Dr. ___ clinic), and Dr. ___, 
a protocol for inpatient management was proposed to ensure this 
patient is treated adequately and safely. Finalized protocol 
will be uploaded to OMR, pending input and edits from outpatient 
providers.

INPATIENT ACUTE PAIN EPISODE MANAGEMENT PROTOCOL
 
If patient presents to ___ with evidence of sickle cell 
disease acute pain episode, he should be managed by symptom with 
the following step-wise therapies in the ED and on admission:
 
#) Acute Pain:
1. Start with IV dilaudid 4mg Q4H:PRN pain with IV tylenol 
___ TID standing; offer hot packs to apply to affected 
joints.
2. If persistent pain, can add on 3 day course of IV ketorolac 
30mg q8 standing.
3. If patient still in pain, can increase interval of IV 
dilaudid to Q3, and would not further escalate opioid regimen.
4. Once patient tolerating food, should be transitioned back to 
equivalent doses of oral oxycodone, and can taper down daily to 
home regimen.
5. Do NOT offer ketamine drip (possible cause of previous 
bradycardia during a prior admission).
NOTE: For dilaudid preparation, should ALWAYS be diluted in 50mL 
of NS and given over 30 minutes, ordered with holding 
parameters.  If patient continues to ask for escalation, please 
call chronic pain service to see.
 
#) Nausea:
1. If unable to tolerate PO/actively vomiting, keep strictly 
NPO, and give aggressive mIVF for acute pain episode with normal 
saline at 200cc/hour.
2. Treat nausea with home PO promethazine.
3. If unable to tolerate PO medication and is vomiting, can give 
promethazine 6.25 mg IV Q6H:PRN nausea.
4. If continues with intolerable nausea and vomiting, can add on 
lorazepam 1 mg PO/NG Q8H:PRN nausea.
5. Strict I/Os of any emesis or food intake. Patient should be 
instructed to save emesis for nurse to quantify.
 
#) Pruritis:
1. Start with diphenhydramine 25mg PO Q6H:PRN itching.
2. If no evidence of hives or other signs of significant 
pruritis (excoriations, distress, etc.), DO NOT GIVE IV 
diphenhydramine.
3. Can offer topical creams for relief.
 
#) Sickle Cell Disease:
1. Encourage oral intake of home medications, including 
hydroxyurea and folic acid.
2. Continuous O2 and incentive spirometry to avoid sickle cell 
crisis.
3. Monitor daily labs for evidence of acute pain episode 
progression (LDH, retic count, total bilirubin)

   Blood Culture, Routine (Pending): No growth to date

STUDIES:
EKG
Very low amplitude P waves. Sinus bradycardia with evidence of 
A-V Wenckebach
and junctional escape beats after the dropped P wave. Native QRS 
complex shows
early progression of R waves and there is diffuse T wave 
flattening that is
non-specific. Compared to tracing #1 P waves are of lower 
amplitude. Early
progression of R waves is now seen and A-V ___ with 
junctional escape is
now noted.

CXR:
Opacities at the right lung base and left perihilar region 
concerning for
pneumonia versus infarcts.

ECHO:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. The estimated right atrial 
pressure is ___ mmHg. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity 
size, and global systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%). 
Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal. Tissue Doppler 
imaging suggests a normal left ventricular filling pressure 
(PCWP<12mmHg). Doppler parameters are most consistent with 
normal left ventricular diastolic function. There is no 
ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size and 
free wall motion are normal. The diameters of aorta at the 
sinus, ascending and arch levels are normal. The aortic valve 
leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet 
excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation. Trace 
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve appears 
structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is 
no mitral valve prolapse. There is borderline pulmonary artery 
systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion. 

IMPRESSION: Preserved regional/global biventricular systolic 
function. No pathologic valvular abnormalities. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:

b/l hips, asplenia, opiate dependence, presenting with c/o 
fevers, cough, and chest pain. Found to have an acute relative 
anemia.  

# SICKLE CELL CRISIS: The patient presented with a Hb 5.5 from a 
baseline of 7.7. Markers of hemolysis (LDH, TBili) trended up 
and haptoglobin was undetectable. Precipitant of crisis is 
secondary to pneumonia (see below). He received a total of 2 
units RBCs to a target of Hb >8. The patient was aggressively 
hydrated with IV fluids. He received oxygen supplementation 
despite SpO2 100%, to prevent acute chest. Pain was managed 
below.

# PAIN:  Pain management was difficult due to concern for opioid 
seeking behavior and a recent admission for possible opioid 
overdose. The patient's PCP has also been tapering oxycodone. 
Per patient and prior documentation, he did not have adequate 
pain management with long acting narcotics such as fentanyl 
patch, oxycontin, and MS contin. Trial of ketamin drip was 
unsuccessful due to nausea. The patient's pain was initially 
managed with standing tylenol and dilaudid 4mg Q2H standing. 
NSAIDs were avoided to prevent kidney damage. Per 
hematology/oncology, his pain was under controlled, as he had 
received up to dilaudid 12mg IV Q3H during previous admissions. 
The patient was started on dilaudid 8mg IV Q3H with a plan to 
taper daily (8mg Q3H, 4mg Q3H, 3mg Q3H, 2mg Q4H, 1.5mg Q4H, then 
1mg Q4H). The patient requested to leave mid-taper. He was 
discharged with a 4 day supply of oxycodone 30mg Q4H until 
follow up with his PCP.  

# BRADYCARDIA: Heart rate ranged from 40-50s. EKG showed 
variable AV block with slow junctional escape. The patient 
remained asymptomatic. Heart block can be rarely associated with 
sickle cell crises. The mechanism is thought to be local 
ischemia in the conduction system of the heart. 

# PNEUMONIA: The patient presented with fevers, cough and 
leukocytosis. CXR was concerning for RLL opacity. Respiratory 
viral cultures were negative. The patient was initially started 
on ceftriaxone and azithromycin. Azithromycin was discontinued 
due to prolonged QTc. Ceftriaxone was transitioned for 
cefpodoxime once able to tolerate PO. 

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
- Hematology/oncology suggest a pain medication schedule rather 
than using PRNs, The schedule should involve a ___ dose 
reduction daily.
- Obtain EKG prior to giving QTc prolonging agents. The 
patient's QTc prolonged with PVCs. 
- Hematology will work on developing a standing pain crisis plan 
that can be documented in OMR for future admissions.
