___ ERCP:
Normal mucosa in the esophagus 
Normal mucosa in the stomach 
After the ___ team pulled the drain back, surgical anatomy

cholangiogram of the right anterior/posterior ducts and both 
left hepatic ducts. On fluoroscopy the intrahepatics were mildly

anastomosis. 
After imaging, the drain was replaced by ___ with endoscopic 
confirmation of the distal part of the drain in the bowel.

Single Balloon Assisted ERCP (___)
Impression:
Normal esophagus and stomach
Surgical anatomy consistent with a Roux-en-Y 
choledochojejunostomy. The biliary limb was marked with SPOT 
tattoo in the proximal portion.
Cannulation of the biliary duct was successful and deep with a 
balloon catheter using a free-hand technique.
The common hepatic duct stone was fragmented using a balloon. 
Stone fragments and sludge were extracted successfully using a 
balloon catheter.
To promote passage of stone fragments, a sphincteroplasty was 
performed successfully using a 8 mm CRE balloon under endoscopic 
and fluoroscopic guidance.   A residual stone fragment could not 
be extracted because it continued slipping past the extraction 
balloon just above the anastomosis.
Otherwise normal SBE assisted ERCP
