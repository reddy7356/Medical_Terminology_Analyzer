Imaging:
RUQUS ___:  
IMPRESSION:  
  
Mildly distended gallbladder containing sludge with trace 
pericholecystic 
fluid without wall thickening or mural edema are not definite 
for acute 
cholecystitis.  If there is a persistent concern for acute 
cholecystitis a 
HIDA scan can be considered for further evaluation. 

HIDA ___: 
 
FINDINGS:  Serial images over the abdomen show homogeneous 
uptake of tracer into 
the hepatic parenchyma. 
  
At 8 minutes, the gallbladder is visualized with tracer activity 
noted in the 
small bowel at 20 minutes. 
  
IMPRESSION:  Normal hepatobiliary scan.  No evidence of 
cholecystitis. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ is a ___ woman with no significant PMH who 
presents with 10 days of epigastric pain with unclear etiology, 
likely IBS exacerbated by recent viral gastroenteritis.

# Epigastric pain
#Likely IBS
Symptoms are most consistent with IBS vs. post-gastroenteritis 
gastritis, although etiology is not entirely clear. RUQUS showed 
possible gallbladder dilation and sludge but HIDA was negative. 
She was seen by GI here who did not feel that she would benefit 
from more inpatient workup including EGD. H. pylori is a 
consideration so we sent a stool H. Pylori antigen, pending at 
discharge. She had a blood test for H. pylori antibody at ___ 
___ but this came back within normal range, and also 
this does not help diagnose acute illess, just exposure. GI also 
felt that there could be an element of IBS so recommended 
anti-spasmotic with Bentyl and bowel regimen with senna and 
miralax, which she will be discharged with. She has outpatient 
GI Follow up and plan for EGD in 3 weeks. Of note, she was 
prophylactically started on amoxicillin and a PPI (but not true 
triple therapy) but there was not clearly a H. pylori diagnosis. 
We will stop the amoxicillin unless H. pylori stool antigen 
comes back positive. We will also hold the PPI given no clear 
indication and its ability to alter H. pylori results. She was 
also given a prescription for Align probiotic.

Transitional Issues:
[] GI follow up on discharge
[] we sent a stool H. Pylori antigen, pending at discharge

>30 minutes were spent preparing this discharge.
