Imaging

CTA Chest/AP ___
Large left renal subcapsular hematoma with active extravasation 
extension into the retroperitoneum. In the absence trauma or 
bleeding disorder, further imaging with MRI is recommended one 
the patient is stable to 
exclude an underlying mass lesion such as angiomyolipoma. 

Renal Angiogram ___. Normal arterial anatomy on selective left renal arteriogram. 
2. Specifically, no active arterial extravasation or 
pseudoaneurysm is 
detected to warrant percutaneous transarterial embolotherapy. 

  
TTE ___

ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) 
are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No 
discrete vegetations are seen. Very mild (1+) aortic 
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve appears structurally 
normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. The estimated 
pulmonary artery systolic pressure is high normal. There is no 
pericardial effusion. 

IMPRESSION: Very mild aortic regurgitation with mild aortic 
valve sclerosis. Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy 
with preserved global and regional biventricular systolic 
function.

Discharge
 
Brief Hospital Course:
SUMMARY
___ year old male with no significant past medical history who 
presents to OSH with left flank pain thought to be anterior 
STEMI s/p heparin bolus + gtt complicated by worsening massive 
subcapsular renal bleed extending into retroperitoneum. His 
course was further complicated by EtOH withdrawal and ___. He is 
discharged to rehab with stable, constant flank/abdominal pain 
and waning delirium

BY ISSUE
# retroperitoneal bleed:  CT found to have left subcapsular 
renal hematoma extending into retroperitoneum likely due to 
ruptured renal cyst s/p falling.  Also likely related to heparin 
drip that was started at OSH for possibility of ACS.  Upon 
transfer to ___, the patient's heparin was stopped, HCT 
monitored every 6 hours.  ___ and Urology were both following the 
patient while in the unit. The patient was initially actively 
bleeding while in the unit.  Required 3U PRBCs.  Angiogram on 
___ showed that there was no renal artery stenosis and there 
were no bleeding vessels to embolize.  His pain was controlled 
with with various analgesics and was stable/constant on 
discharge
.
# ___: Cr was 1.5 on admission and peaked at 1.7; baseline Cr 
was normal.  ___ was likely due to prerenal etiology in setting 
of retroperitoneal hematoma.  The patient was fluid resuscitated 
and his creatinine was trended.  Upon transfer out of the MICU, 
his creat had stabilized and was at baseline by time of 
discharge.  
.  
# Alcohol withdrawal: After the RP bleed was stabilized, the 
patient began to show clinical signs of withdrawal, including 
hallucinations, hypertension, and tachycardia.  He was started 
on CIWA scale and given diazepam ___ mg q1h PRN and lorazepam 
1 mg for breakthrough anxiety.  The patient initially had 
hallucinations, which improved after benzo treatment.  The 
patient was also getting precedex for some more sedation.   Upon 
discharge from the MICU, the patient was sundowning and 
delirius, but no longer actively withdrawing.  While in the MICU 
and also on the medical floor, the patient was being seen by 
social work re: alcohol cessation.  Family was also counseled on 
importance of pt's cessation from alcohol.  
.
# sundowning:  The patient started sundowning while in the MICU, 
and was started Zyprexa qhs, and Haldol qhs PRN for agitation. 
All antipsychotics and sedatives were discontinued on the 
medical floor.  Pt continued to have waxing and waning of mental 
status.  He was not acutely agitated but continued to have 
intermittent confusion on the medical floor but was fully 
oriented at the time of discharge

# "Anterior STEMI":  There was concern at OSH for EKG changes 
concerning for STEMI.  The patient was seen by cardiology on 
arrival to ___, and they did not think that the patient was 
having active ischemia.  The heparin drip was then stopped.  
Trop peaked at 0.04, but was not trended.  
.
# Hypertension:  The patient was found to be hypertensive in the 
unit, likely related to the EtOH withdrawal. Angiogram showed 
fully patent renal artery on the side with large hematoma, 
making compression of renal vasculature and subsequent 
hypertension unlikely.  He was initially started on Labetolol 
(in addition to his CIWA protocol) to control his heart rates 
and blood pressures.  However, Labetolol caused the patient to 
become wheezy, and it was discontinued.  He was then switched to 
clonidine patch, which helped both his pressures and his 
sympathetic tone.  Given the question of heart failure (see 
below), the patient was also started on metoprolol.  He was 
started on captopril on the medical floor and transitioned to 
lisinopril upon discharge.     
.
#. Resp distress/? heart failure: The patient had 2 acute 
episodes of wheezing/resp distress while in the MICU in the 
setting of having very elevated blood pressures, likely 
consistent with flash pulmonary edema.  CXR showed evidence of 
increasing volume overload and the patient responded to 
temporary BiPAP and diuresis with Lasix. 
.
# Cellulitis: Pt had left foot pain, erythema, and swelling.  
Initially he was given colchicine for suspected gout. However, 
swelling worsened.  X-ray was negative for fracture; ___ 
negative for DVT. He was started on keflex for presumed 
cellulitis. 

# Aspiration: ___ underwent bedside swallow evaluation that was 
concerning for aspiration.  He underwent video swallow that 
showed aspiration with thin liquids.  This was repeated several 
days later when mental status improved but pt continued to show 
aspiration with thin liquids. He was kept on pureed diet with 
nectar thickened liquids.  He should have a repeat swallow 
evaluation in two weeks. 

TRANSITIONAL
1. Will need f/u Video swallow to determine if aspiration 
resolved ___ week of ___
2. Continue to promote etoh cessation
3. Pain can be managed conservatively with tylenol, tramadol 
prn. Ensure bowel movements.
4. Patient will need PCP follow up to manage high blood pressure
5. His mental status improvement is progressive. He is 
discharged with occasional confusion but fully oriented when 
using a ___ interpreter.
5. He will need urology follow up to be scheduled on discharge 
from your facility.

ACTIVE ISSUES
# Right thalamic hemorrhage: seen on CT scan, though no apparent 
change from prior. The patient was admitted to the ICU for 
concern for increased somnolence in the setting of a bleed. 
However, review of OSH imaging (which was not available at time 
of admission) showed that the patient's bleed is stable and 
improving, no new bleed, so the patient was transferred to the 
floor. Aggressive BP control was initiated given recent bleed 
(see below). ASA were both stopped initially and then SubQ 
heparin was restarted. This was stable throughout the hospital 
course. PEG was placed ___ without complication and feeds 
restarted.
.
# HTN: the patient's BP was uncontrolled on admission. He was 
controlled with IV hydral prn. He was started on amlodipine. 
Prior to discharge, amlodipine was started/stopped/etc.
.
# Klebsiella UTI: Treated with a dose of Bactrim ___. Missed 
dose ___ due to NPO after failing speech & swallow. Started 
ceftriaxone ___ which should be continued until ___. 
.
# Anion gap metabolic acidosis: In setting of respiratory 
alkalosis with overall pH 7.39. Lactate was normal. Attributed 
to ketosis in setting of NPO. Mild and stable. 
.
# Hiccups: Not correlated with increased ICP. Treated with Zydis 
x1 on ___ with complete resolution.
.
# Anemia: Mild; stable
.
INACTIVE ISSUES
# Cough: CXR without consolidation to suggest pneumonia
# GI:  continued home pantoprazole 
.
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES
# ICH: Follow up with neurology. Speech and swallow at least 
twice weekly. In the interim, continue tube feeds. 
.
# Bicarbonate: Follow at least twice weekly.
.
# UTI: No e/o urosepsis; end date antibiotics is ___ 
___. 
.
# Anemia: Trend at least twice weekly; continue work-up as 
appropraite
