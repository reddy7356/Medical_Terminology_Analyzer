cancer s/p LUL lobectomy, recent admission to ___ from 
___ for COPD exacerbation who presented on ___ worsening 
difficulty breathing since discharge and found to have new CXR 
infiltrate, leukocytosis, and fever concerning for healthcare 
associated pneumonia. He subsequently developed worsening cough 
with sputum production and wheezing consistent with COPD 
exacerbation. 

Primary Issues:

# HCAP: 
Patient presented with leukocytosis and fever with new CXR 
infiltrate suggesting HCAP as etiology of presenting hypoxemic 
respiratory failure. Though leukocytosis may have been secondary 
to recent steroid administration from prior admission he was 
treated with broad spectrum antibiotics (vancomycin, cefepime, 
and azithromycin) and narrowed to complete 7 day antibiotic 
course ( ___ = day 1) with levofloxacin. Blood cultures showed 
no growth to date and sputum cultures notable for commensal 
flora and no pathogens. 

# COPD Exacerbation: 
On Hospital day ___  patient experienced a worsening cough 
and increased wheezing. At this time was thought to have COPD 
exacerbation and started on  high dose steroids ___ = day 1), 
but given his very recent previous exacerbation and recurrent 
disease with severe COPD, he was put on a long taper (as below). 
He was given standing nebulizer treatment with albuterol and 
maintained on his home regimen of fluticasone, guaifenesin, and 
tiotropium bromide. He showed clinical improvement with 
diminished cough, sputum, and improved work of breathing with 
this regimen. His nebulizer treatments were spaced out from 
standing q6hr doses to q6hr PRN. 

Active Issues:

 # DM2:  
During admission patient's home metformin was held and his blood 
glucose were monitored and treated with insulin sliding scale. 
On the day prior to discharge patient was restarted on home 
Metformin 1000 mg BID. Required insulin standing (NPH 10u sc 
bid) and Humalog sliding scale while in-house, likely due to 
ongoing steroid use.

#Thrombocytopenia /Anemia: 
Platelets were within 100-130 range throughout admission. 
Etiology of thrombocytopenia is unclear. This is a chronic issue 
for this patient. Throughout his stay he had no bleeds and his 
hematocrit was stably low 33-38 range 

 # Current smoking:  
Encouraged cessation during admission and provided with daily 
nicotine patch

 
Stable Issues
 # CAD/HLD:  
Patient was maintained on his home aspirin and rosuvastatin 
regimen during hospital admission. Metoprolol was fractionated 
during admission and restarted to home regimen one day prior to 
discharge.   

 # PVD, Hx of AAA s/p repair:  
 Patient was continued on home Cilostazol 100 mg PO BID  

 # HTN:  
During admission patient was placed on fractionated dose of 
Diltiazem and subsequently transitioned to home regimen one day 
prior to discharge.

 # Chronic pain:  
Pain was managed with home regimen of acetaminophen, gabapentin, 
tramadol and lidocaine.

 # GERD:  
 Home regimen of Omeprazole 20 mg PO BID was continued 
throughout admission
 
 # BPH:  
 Patient was provided home Tamsulosin 0.4 mg PO QHS   

Transitional Issues:
#Steroid Taper: 
___ - Decrease to 50 mg Prednisone Daily
___ - Decrease to 40 mg Prednisone Daily
___ - Decrease to 30 mg Prednisone Daily
___ - Decrease to 20 mg Prednisone Daily
___ - Decrease to 10 mg Prednisone Daily
___ - Stop Prednisone

#Insulin: Started on standing + HSS insulin given hyperglycemia 
during admission, likely in part due to high dose steroids. 
These requirements are likely to decrease as prednisone is 
tapered so pre-meal and night time glucose should be checked 
daily. Unclear if may require new insulin after discharge from 
rehab. 

#Pulmonary nodule up to 4 mm found on ___ CT scan in prior 
admission. Patient is a high risk patient given  lifetime 
smoking history and prior history of lung cancer. ___ 
___ pulmonary nodules recommends follow up for nodule size 
less than or equal to 4 mm at 12 months for high risk patients. 
If no change no further imaging is needed.

Brief Hospital Course:
Summary
___ with history of COPD on 3L home O2 and frequent 
hospitalization for COPD exacerbations, as well as lung cancer 
s/p LUL lobectomy, and some baseline dementia presenting with 
dyspnea.

Acute issues
#COPD EXACCERBATION: The patient initially reported recent acute 
increase in dyspnea and cough over the last 24h which is 
suggestive of COPD exacerbation. Patient has a history of 
frequent COPD exacerbations and has received several courses of 
steroids and antibiotics over the last year (most recently in 
early ___. The patient does have some difficulty relaying the 
history (possibly secondary to some baseline dementia) and the 
history obtained suggests a more progressive worsening of 
respiratory status as opposed to an acute exacerbation. On 
admission he did not had any fevers/white cell count or evidence 
of pneumonia on CXR making infection unlikely. Furthermore, his 
influenza swab was negative. EKG showed no ST elevation, 
troponin negative, making ACS unlikely. BNP was 60 making heart 
failure unlikely, but patient has no recent ECHO. BMP 
unremarkable. Elevated D-dimer, but CTA showed no evidence of 
pulmonary embolism. He was given a dose of IV methylprednisone 
in the ED. He was also given 1g of ceftriaxone in the ED to 
cover for a possible pneumonia but did not require additional IV 
antibiotics. He was started on a 5 day course of prednisone 40mg 
and azithromycin for possible COPD exacerbation. On day of 
transfer to the ___ he was breathing well on 4L NC which is close 
to baseline. 

Chronic Issues
#HTN: Longstanding, on metoprolol succinate 75mg daily and 
diltiazem ER 360mg daily at home. Patient was hypertensive 
(173/93) on arrival to the floor, likely due to missing 
medication doses in the ED. He was started on his home diltiazem 
and on metoprolol tartrate 37.5mg BID and pressures were well 
controlled. 

#T2DM: Non-insulin dependent, on metformin only at home (last 
A1c 8.3 (___). Home metformin was held and he was started on 
Humalog sliding scale. Blood sugars were 140s on day of 
transfer.

#Nicotine and substance dependence: Patient has a longstanding 
heavy smoking history. Currently smokes <10 cigarettes per day. 
Smoking cessation was encouraged and nicotine patch provided. He 
also reported ongoing cocaine and marijuana use. He was 
counseled on the importance of abstaining from illicit drugs. 

#Pulmonary Nodules: Nodules on CTA scan. Given that the patient 
has a hx of NSCLC (stage 1a) s/p left upper lobe lobectomy. See 
transitional issue below.

#Coronary artery disease, history of MI. Continued home ASA 81mg 
and home Rosuvastatin 40 mg QPM. 

#Peripheral Artery Disease s/p stent. Continued home Cilostazol 
100mg BID. 

#Peripheral neuropathy. Continued home Gabapentin (300mg TID + 
300mg qHS).

#GERD. Continued home omeprazole

lung cancer s/p left upper lobectomy, CAD, PVD, AAA s/p repair, 
T2DM, HTN, and HLD presents from home with acute shortness of 
breath and wheezing, now improved after receiving nebulizers and 
steroids. 

# Dyspnea
# COPD with exacerbation
# Mild cognitive impairment
The patient presented with very acute onset of dyspnea at home 
and mild obstruction on admission exam. He was started on 
nebulizers and steroids, and his mild wheezing resolved. Upon 
further interviewing, the patient states that his dyspnea was 
related to anxiety from social issues he is having at home. He 
lives in an independent living facility for homeless elders and 
states he has disagreements with some of the other residents. 
Upon speaking with the patient's ___ providers, it appears the 
patient has been hospitalized at multiple ___ in 
the last several months for the exact same presentation. The ___ 
(his primary care clinic) has tried to arrange case managers and 
palliative care to help the patient avoid hospitalizations, but 
he often stands in the way of his own care and is lost to follow 
up. His mild cognitive impairment appears to be gradually 
worsening, and both the ___ and his independent living facility 
personnel have been working with him to find a more suitable 
living arrangement. Please see Social Work notes in OMR.
Due to low suspicion for a clinically significant COPD flare and 
rising blood sugars on prednisone, it was decided to limit his 
treatment course to a five day burst rather than an extend 
prednisone taper as would usually be warranted in a patient with 
recurrent COPD exacerbations. He completed 5 days of prednisone 
(no antibiotics) in the hospital along with his home inhalers 
and nebulizers prn. He was seen by ___ who found the patient to 
be safe for home but recommended ___, ___, and OT. These services 
were provided on discharge.

His hospital course was also notable for:
# Sinus tachycardia: Noted on prior hospitalization during which 
time PE was ruled out with CTA chest. His ___ providers confirm 
that this issue is known, and he has been scheduled with 
cardiology at the ___ but fails to show. He was continued on his 
home diltiazem and metoprolol XL doses with HRs in the ___.

# Type 2 diabetes mellitus: Fingersticks were elevated to the 
200s-300s. This was likely due to prednisone and should be 
monitored after discharge once patient is off prednisone. 

Chronic issues:
# CAD: No evidence of ACS. He was continued on his home ASA, 
statin, and beta blocker.
#Nicotine dependence, marijuana use: smoking cessation 
encouraged.
#Peripheral Artery Disease s/p stent: continued on home 
Cilostazol.
#Peripheral neuropathy: continued on home Gabapentin.

[x] I have seen and examined the patient and agree that the
patient is ready for discharge. 
[x] Greater than 30 minutes were spent coordinating the care of
this patient.
