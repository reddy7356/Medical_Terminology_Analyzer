differently than this episode. Further, he has not experienced 
any rash or skin vesicles. Episodes not associated with chest 
pressure/pain, diaphoresis or nausesa. Patient reports some 
chest congestion last week which had resolved 4 days ago but now 
appears to be back today, along with some wheezing. No 
significant sore throat or congestion. No orthopnea, no leg pain

Micro:
Influenza A/B Negative:
Viral respiratory panel: pending upon discharge

Imagining:
___ CXR: Hyperinflated lungs with mild bibasilar 
atelectasis. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
The following issues were addressed over the course of the 
hospital stay:

___ with HIV well controlled, RAD, recent URI with cough and 
wheezing, presents with episodes of lightheadedness on standing, 
left side tingling of trunk/shoulder/arm, found to be febrile, 
tachycardic and rigoring in ED  

#Pneumonia: Fever, tachycardia, mild cough, wheezing. 
Generalized weakness w/ lactate 3.4 --> 1.5. CXR not convincing 
for pneumonia but given presentation suspect a viral etiology. 
Covered for atypicals given HIV status although well controlled. 
Influenza A/B negative with viral throat culture pending upon 
discharge as would not change management. Patient treated with 
levoquin that should continue for a total of 5 days of treatment 
given immunocompromised and clinically improving with 
antibiotics.

#Asthma Exacerbation: Treated with prednisone 60 mg x 1 which 
was discontinued due to two episodes of explosive diarrhea (see 
below). Patient's ambulatory sat was 97-99% prior to discharge 
and thus felt that the risk of prednisone outweight potential 
benefits. However patient instructed if his breathing does not 
improve within 5 days he may need a prednisone burst in the 
future. Continued on home asthma meds. Peak flows measured in 
house were 150 with patient instructed to check peak flows at 
least 3 times a day and keep a log for his PCP in ___. 

#Diarrhea: patient developed two explosive episodes of diarrhea. 
These episodes were isolated and did not recur prior to 
discharge for a c. diff sample to be sent. He had no associated 
abdominal pain. Patient instructed if he develops severe 
diarrhea associated with abdominal pain to call primary care to 
be seen or come to ED.

#Lightheadedness with tingling of L trunk/shoulder/arm. 
Lightheadedness on standing suggestive of orthostasis, but neg 
orthostasis on exam. He has had similar episodes in the remote 
past involving his legs, which raises concern for a neurological 
etiology given his hereditary neuropathy. He underwent cardiac 
echo (TTE) on ___ which demonstrated LVEF > 55 %; no 
valvular disease; mildly dilated aortic root. Mild pulmonary 
artery systolic hypertension. In the ED trop neg and no EKG 
changes, making unstable angina unlikely.  Orthostatics negative 
and symptoms resolved by discharge. No evidence of zoster on 
exam. Utimately symptoms felt to be due to Rafsum's disease.

#) HIV. Stable on atripla, seen in ___ clinic today. No h/o  
AIDS defining infection in the past or OI. PPD previously 
negative in ___.  
  
# HTN. stable  
- continued HCTZ 
 
# Allergy  
- continued home ___ meds 
  
# Refsum Disease c/b polyneuropathy  
- low fat diet  
 
Transitional issues:
[ ] f/u on Peak flows as outpatient to ensure improvement of 
asthma
[ ] patient may need prednisone taper in future if symptoms do 
not improve
[ ] monitor diarrhea

diarrhea you had prior to discharge. However, since the dirrhea 
was limited to two episodes and had ceased prior to discharge, 
it is safe for you to go home with the understanding if this 
worsens or if you develop abdominal pain please call your 
primary care physician to be seen sooner. 

It was a pleasure taking care of you here at ___. Please 
continue to monitor your peak flows at home at least 3 times/day 
and keep a log. Bring this to your primary care provider's 
appointment.

IMAGING:

CXR ___:
Possible focal opacity at the inferior lingula, could represent 
pneumonia in the correct clinical setting.  Clinical correlation 
is advised.  

EKG ___:
Sinus tachycardia with sinus arrhythmia. Otherwise, within 
normal limits. No major diagnostic interim change from the 
previous tracing. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ year old gentleman with HIV, Refsum's disease, reactive 
airway disease, restrictive lung disease who presents to the ___ 
with dyspnea and lightheadness. There was concern that his 
dyspnea was due to an acute worsening of his known reactive 
airway disease. His CXR was suspicious for a possible pneumonia. 
He was given steroids to help with the reactive airway disease 
and a course of azithromycin for possible community acquired 
pneumonia.  

ACTIVE PROBLEMS  
#) Dyspnea: At presentation the patient reported experiencing 
dyspnea (worse than his baseline) intermittently for a few days. 
The patient has a history of reactive airway disease which 
worsens with weather changes and his seasonal allergies -- this 
was thought to be at least a contributing factor to his acute 
worsening dyspnea. In the ___ his oxygen saturation was good on 
room air and there was no evidence of accessory muscle use with 
breathing on his initial exam. His CXR in ___ showed a possible 
infiltrate in the inferior lingula, and given his 
immunocomropised state (last CD4 225) there was a higher 
suspicion of an infectious process. He was started on 
azithromycin and ceftriaxone in the ___ (and later transitioned 
to azithromycin and cefpodoxime once he got to the general 
medicine floor). On the medicine floor his exam was remarkable 
for prominent end expiratory wheezing in bilateral lungs.  He 
was also given prednisone & albuterol and ipratropium nebulizer 
treatments for concerns that his reactive airway disease was 
contributing to his symptoms. Because he did not require 
supplemental oxygen and he had a low CURB 65 score it was felt 
that he could be discharged home. He was discharged on a 
prednisone burst and azithrmycin for a 5 day course.  Urine 
legionella negative. Blood cultures no growth at time of 
discharge. 
  
#) Lightheadness: The patient reported feeling lightheaded the 
morning of admission in addition to experiencing dyspnea.  At 
admission the differential included orthostasis, drug adverse 
effect (given that he started Atripla the day of admission), or 
alternatively a primary CNS process given immunocompromised 
state.  His neuro exam was unremarkable and his lightheadness 
resolved while he was in the Emergency Department without 
intervention. CBC, chem 10 and repeat EKGs were unremarkable.  
He was not orthostatic.  He was monitored on telemetry without 
any concerning events. His feelings of lightheadness did not 
reoccur.  Possible that could be related to Atripla although 
after discussion with ___. ___, this was continued. Further 
workup of his this lightheadness was deferred to the outpatient 
setting. 

CHRONIC ISSUES:

# HIV: Last CD4 count was 225. Followed by Dr. ___ as an 
outpatient. No history of AIDS defining infection in the past.  
He was started on Atripla on ___. Dr. ___ was 
contacted via email and agreed with continuing the patient on 
Atripla. 

# Hypertension: Stable. He was continued on home dose of HCTZ 
12.5 mg daily -- although the patient reported only taking it 
when his BP is high or when he has too much salt in his food. He 
was advised to his medication regularly and as it is prescribed 
by his PCP.

# Seasonal allergies: Stable -- may have been contributing to 
his dyspnea. He was continued on his home regimen of nasal 
fluticasone, fexofenidine and nasal saline flushes.

# Refsum disease c/b polyneuropathy: Stable. On a low fat diet 
during this admission.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
[ ] follow up finalization of blood cultures 
.
#) CODE STATUS: Full  
#) CONTACT: patient and HCP ___ ___, 
___ (work)
