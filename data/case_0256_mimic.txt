IMAGING 
=======
___ TTE:
The left atrium is elongated. No atrial septal defect is seen by 
2D or color Doppler. Late saline contrast is seen in left heart 
suggesting intrapulmonary shunting. The estimated right atrial 
pressure is at least 15 mmHg. Left ventricular wall thickness, 
cavity size and regional/global systolic function are normal 
(LVEF = 65%). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left 
ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Right ventricular 
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The diameters of 
aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels are normal. The 
aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good 
leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic 
regurgitation. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with 
trivial mitral regurgitation. There is mild pulmonary artery 
systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.  

___ TIPS:
1. Scout ultrasound images demonstrate a patent paraumbilical 
vein. 
2. Pre-procedure splenic/portal venogram demonstrating a patent 
portal venous system. A splenorenal shunt is noted arising from 
the mid splenic vein. 
3. Post Amplatzer plug deployment venogram demonstrating 
appropriate near complete occlusion of the splenorenal shunt. 
4. Post procedure pressures: Right atrium:25 mmHg; Main Portal 
Vein: 36 mmHg; Splenic Vein: 42 mm Hg. 
  
Successful near complete occlusion of splenorenal shunt 
utilizing an Amplatzer plug via a paraumbilical vein approach. 

___ RUQUS:
1. Patent hepatic vasculature.  The direction of flow is 
reversed in the right portal vein. 
2. Multiple suspicious focal liver lesions are not fully 
characterized on this ultrasound in should be further assessed 
with MRI to exclude possible HCC. 
3. Splenomegaly, trace ascites, and a patent paraumbilical vein 
indicative of portal hypertension. 

CT Abd/Pelvis with contrast ___:
1. Normal caliber small and large bowel loops. No findings of 
bowel ischemia. 
2. Cirrhosis of the liver with findings of portal hypertension, 
including splenomegaly, gastroesophageal varices, large 
recanalized paraumbilical vein and large varices within the 
rectus sheath.  Interval placement of an Amplatzer plug within a 
splenorenal shunt since the prior outside CT from ___. 
3. Limited evaluation for focal hepatic lesions secondary to 
suboptimal timing on the arterial phase.  1.1 x 1.1 cm 
hypodensity in segment III, indeterminate.  Suggestion of other 
scattered subcentimeter hypodensities in the liver. Nonurgent 
contrast-enhanced MRI of the abdomen is recommended for further 
evaluation. 
4. Small amount of abdominopelvic ascites and mesenteric edema, 
new since the prior CT. 
5. Small right pleural effusion.  1.9 x 2.0 cm low density 
opacity in the right lower lobe abutting the diaphragmatic 
surface, new since the prior CT, likely representing pulmonary 
pseudotumor. 

___ HEPATIC VENOGRAPHY:
FINDINGS: 
 
1.  Ultrasound evaluation of the right common femoral vein 
demonstrates it to be patent, compressible and have flow on 
color evaluation.
2.  Left renal venogram demonstrates brisk flow of contrast into 
the inferior vena cava.
3.  Pre embolization digital subtracted venogram of the 
splenorenal shunt
(with and without balloon occlusion) demonstrates a membranous 
shelf
approximately 5 mm from the level of the outflow ostium.  
Additional digital subtracted venograms of the splenorenal shunt 
also demonstrated flow into the portal venous system via of few 
smaller inflow vessels likely from short gastric veins.
4.  Post plug assisted retrograde trans venous obliteration left 
renal
venogram demonstrates appropriate stasis within the splenorenal 
shunt without compromise (thrombus) in the patent left renal 
vein.
 
IMPRESSION:  
Successful plug assisted retrograde transvenous obliteration of 
a splenorenal shunt with the use of approximately 2 cc of 
sclerosant foam.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ is a ___ woman with a history of presumed ETOH 
cirrhosis c/b gastric varices and ascites, admitted as transfer 
from ___ with gastric variceal bleed. She had a brief 
MICU stay notable for BATO with interventional radiology on 
___, supportive transfusion. She had ___ which improved with 
resuscitation. BATO for portosystemic shunt occlusion was 
incomplete on ___ so she underwent second procedure for shunt 
embolization on ___ which was uncomplicated. She was 
monitored afterwards and had some minor abdominal pain which was 
improving at the time of discharge. She was medically stable 
with plan for follow up with Hepatology in ___s 
plans to make an appointment with a new primary care doctor to 
follow up her hospitalization.

#) Gastric variceal bleed: Patient presented with massive upper 
GI bleed with hgb nadir of 4.2. Transfused a total of 6 units of 
PRBcs, 2 units of FFP, and 1u platelets. Given vitamin K 10 IV x 
1. Due to gastric variceal bleed from EtOH cirrhosis. She 
underwent BATO x2, with definitive closure of splenorenal shunt 
on ___.  Hb 9.0 on day of discharge and stable without 
further transfusion needs during admission. She was discharged 
on BID PPI.

# Abdominal pain/Post-operative pain: CT Abd/Pelvis showed no 
post-op complications after first procedure. Pain improved 
throughout admission and continued to do so prior to discharge. 
No rebound or guarding to suggest worsening intra-abdominal 
process. She was discharged on tylenol with a few days supply of 
oxycodone PRN after second procedure.

# Lower extremity edema: Dependent edema in the thighs and +1 to

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,

You came to the hospital because you were experiencing nausea 
and vomiting blood. You were found to have varices (dilated 
veins) in your stomach from your liver disease that were causing 
the bleeding. You were given blood and you had a procedure 
performed by the interventional radiologists to close down a 
vein in your abdomen to try to prevent further bleeding from 
your varices. 

Please continue to take your medications as directed and follow 
up with your doctors as directed.

It was a pleasure taking care of you, we wish you the best,
Your ___ Care Team
