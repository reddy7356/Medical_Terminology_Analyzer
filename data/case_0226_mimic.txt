IMPRESSION: 
1. Status post aortobifemoral bypass and right-sided graft stent 
with complete 
occlusion of all the right-sided vessels extending from the 
bypass graft to 
the right lower extremity stump. 
2. Extensive atherosclerotic calcifications involving the Left 
lower extremity 
vessels with likely occlusion of the left superficial femoral 
artery.  Left 
peroneal artery appears patent.  However, the left anterior and 
posterior 
tibial arteries are highly calcified, limiting evaluation for 
patency. 
3. Left adnexal cystic lesion measuring 3.2 cm.  Nonemergent 
outpatient pelvic 
ultrasound is recommended for further evaluation. 
4. Likely minimal gallbladder sludge or stones within a 
nondistended 
gallbladder. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
Patient is a ___ F with past medical history of CAD, peripheral 
arterial disease s/p
aortobifemoral bypass, bilateral fem pop bypasses, R fem 
endarterectomy, and R BKA
(___) complicated by an episode of stump ischemia requiring an 
additional femoral endarterectomy and R iliac stent. She 
presents to the ED with 3 days of cool and painful right BKA 
stump site. A CTA was performed, which demonstrated recurrent
occlusion of her right iliac limb with minimal flow down her 
profunda via collaterals from the inferior epigastric. The 
patient was heparinized, and went to the OR with Vascular 
Surgery for an urgent right femoral exposure with thrombectomy 
on ___. The patient ultimately underwent a right iliac limb 
thrombectomy with bovine pericardium patch repair. Procedure was 
uncomplicated with EBL of 700 CC (please see operative note for 
additional details), with Doppler ultrasound of the graft limb 
with a brisk triphasic signal at the end of the case. The 
patient was extubated post-operatively, and transported to the 
PACU in good condition. 

Post-operative labs demonstrated a hematocrit drop from 42.7 to 
30.5, but the patient was doing well, with no tachycardia or 
hypotension and maintaining MAPs greater than 70. After a brief, 
uneventful stay in the PACU, the patient was transferred to the 
floor in good condition. On POD 1, the patient continued to have 
good dopplerable signals through her graft, and her BKA stump 
was improved in colour and warmth. She remained therapeutic on 
her heparin drip. Her Foley catheter was removed, and she voided 
spontaneously. She also began ambulating with her prosthesis, 
but was noted to be short of breath with exertion by her RN. 
Physical Therapy was consulted. On POD 2, she was transitioned 
from the heparin drip to Eliquis 5 mg BID, which she will remain 
on for the rest of her life, given her history of recurrent 
thrombotic events. Her systolic blood pressure was elevated to 
the 150s, which improved to the 130s after restarting her home 
losartan and HCTZ. 

On POD 3, she was evaluated by Physical Therapy, who cleared her 
for discharge to home with assistance from her sister and with a 
rolling walker. She was hypertensive while working with ___, with 
SBP 180s-190s. She had previously been prescribed amlodipine at 
home, but said she had discontinued it as her blood pressures 
had been in target prior to this admission. She was started back 
on her home amlodipine 2.5 mg daily, with improvement in her SBP 
to 130s. She was deemed ready for discharge to home with ___ for 
removal of her Prevena vac (on POD 5) and blood pressure checks. 


On the day of discharge, the patient was doing well, afebrile 
with stable vital signs. She was tolerating a regular diet, 
voiding spontaneously, and passing flatus without issue. Her 
pain was well-controlled on oral oxycodone-acetaminophen. She 
was ambulating with her prosthetic and a rolling walker. The 
patient received discharge instructions, and will follow up with 
Dr. ___ in 1 month. The staples from her right groin 
surgical site may be removed about 2.5 weeks after discharge by 
her primary care provider or ___ local surgeon in her home of 
___. If her blood pressure remains elevated with SBP > 140 
on ___ checks, she should follow up with her primary care 
provider for adjustment of her anti-hypertensive regimen.
