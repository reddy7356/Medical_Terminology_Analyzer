HPI: 
The patient is a ___ year old  woman with PMH hypertension, DM,
OSA (on CPAP), persistent atrial fibrillation on apixaban, MR,
DM2 p/w IPH s/p fall.

She reports that at circa 730 am this morning she was getting 
out
of bed to go to the bathroom and fell on her back and buttocks.
While on the floor she felt like her whole body was weak and she

piece of furniture in her bedroom. She does not think she had 
any
loss of consciousness. She had no vomiting. She eventually
reached a phone and called a friend.
EMS was called and she was brought to OSH where SBP was 185/153, 

CT-C spine  demonstrated no cervical spine fracture, and CT head
showed intra-axial bleed in the right basal ganglia with a
calculated volume of 1.4 mL and no mass-effect. There are also
changes consistent with small vessel ischemic disease with
atrophy.
She was given Kcentra. Chest x-ray demonstrated evidence of an
ill-defined right upper lobe infiltrative process medially. She
was transferred to ___ for further care. 

She currently denies any focal weakness, numbness, diplopia,
difficulty with speech or vision. No headache. No recent fevers,
illness, or unintentional weightloss. 

At baseline she is independent in her daily activities and walks

3. Mild periventricular and deep white matter FLAIR 
hyperintensities are

disease. 
  

 
Brief Hospital Course:
Outpatient Providers: Ms. ___ is an ___ year old woman with PMH 
hypertension, DM, OSA on CPAP, persistent atrial fibrillation on 
apixaban s/p recent successful ablation, MR who presents with 
right thalamic intraparenchymal hemorrhage s/p fall. 

#Right Thalamic Intraparenchymal Hemorrhage
The etiology of bleed is likely secondary to transient 
variations in hypertension, possibly exacerbated by vagal 
episodes with CPAP overnight and further provoked by therapeutic 
anti-coagulation with apixaban combined with long-standing daily 
aspirin for
primary prevention.

The patient underwent MRI which did not reveal underlying 
lesion. Apixiban and aspirin were held on admission. Patient 
also had repeat head CT which showed stability of the bleed. 

We discussed with the patient that although she has had a 
hemorrhagic stroke, given her history of atrial fibrillation, 
she is also at risk for ischemic strokes in the future, so it 
will be prudent to resume anticoagulation in two weeks (___) 
if patient remains clinically stable. Patient was amenable. 

Given hemorrhage, we discussed with her cardiologist whether 
aspirin was needed in addition to apixiban. It was felt that 
monotherapy with apixiban is sufficient so aspirin was not 
resumed. 

Patient passed bedside swallow assessment so was started on 
regular diet. Patient was seen by ___ who recommended acute 
rehab.

#Atrial Fibrillation with successful electrical cardioversion 
___:
Patient was noted to be bradycardic on admission. This improved 
during her hospitalization. She was continued home Amiodarone 
and metoprolol. Apixiban was held on admission. Plan to resume 
on ___ if bleed in stable. - hold apixaban 5mg po bid

#HTN: Patient was continued on home Triamterene-HCTZ (37.5/25) 
and remained within goal.

# DMI II: Patient was placed on insulin sliding scale.
- RISS, finger sticks

#E. Coli UTI: Patient started on Bactrim on ___ for 3 day 
course. 

#OSA: Patient was continued on home CPAP settings overnight

#MSK: Patient had significant bruising on her left elbow and 
knee from fall. She underwent trauma eval with no concern for 
fracture.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,  

 You were hospitalized due to symptoms of weakness resulting 
from an ACUTE HEMORRHAGIC STROKE, a condition where there is 
bleeding in the brain. The brain is the part of your body that 
controls and directs all the other parts of your body, so damage 
to the brain from being deprived of its blood supply can result 
in a variety of symptoms.  

 Stroke can have many different causes, so we assessed you for 
medical conditions that might raise your risk of having stroke. 
In order to prevent future strokes, we plan to modify those risk 
factors. Your risk factors are:  

- high blood pressure

 We are changing your medications as follows:  
- please do not resume apixiban for at least two weeks from your 
hemorrhage (___). 
- STOP aspirin
  
 Please take your other medications as prescribed.  

 Please follow up with Neurology and your primary care physician 
as listed below. 
 
 If you experience any of the symptoms below, please seek 
emergency medical attention by calling Emergency Medical 
Services (dialing 911). In particular, since stroke can recur, 
please pay attention to the sudden onset and persistence of 
these symptoms:  

 - Sudden partial or complete loss of vision  
 - Sudden loss of the ability to speak words from your mouth  
 - Sudden loss of the ability to understand others speaking to 
you  
 - Sudden weakness of one side of the body  
 - Sudden drooping of one side of the face  
 - Sudden loss of sensation of one side of the body  
 Sincerely,  
 Your ___ Neurology Team

Brief Hospital Course:
On admission, Ms. ___ was noted to be euvolemic, but with 
significant hypokalemia and acute kidney injury. She had 
recently been started on furosemide, and had increased diarrhea 
over the last several days, which likely explains her 
hypokalemia. She was given almost 200 mEq of oral potassium, 
with improvement of her K to 3.9. With her improved potassium, 
she was again able to walk at her baseline, including walking 
the stairs. She will be discharged on her home medications, with 
an additional 40 mEq of potassium each day as a supplement. She 
will follow up with her primary care provider.

Hospital course by problem:

1. Symptomatic hypokalemia

- resume home furosemide

2. ___. Resolved with oral fluids.

3. HTN. Resumed home metoprolol and HCTZ-Triamterene.
