Pertinent Results:
___ Cardiac cath
• Mild non-obstructive LAD CAD. Otherwise clean coronaries.

___ TEE
The left atrial volume index is SEVERELY increased. The right 
atrial pressure could not be estimated. There is
mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with a normal cavity 
size. There is moderate global left ventricular
hypokinesis. No thrombus or mass is seen in the left ventricle. 
Quantitative biplane left ventricular ejection
fraction is 31 %. Due to severity of mitral regurgitation, 
intrinsic left ventricular systolic function likely be
lower. There is no resting left ventricular outflow tract 
gradient. Normal right ventricular cavity size with mild
global free wall hypokinesis. Intrinsic right ventricular 
systolic function is likely lower due to the severity of
tricuspid regurgitation. The aortic sinus diameter is normal for 
gender with normal ascending aorta diameter
for gender. The aortic arch diameter is normal. An aortic valve 
bioprosthesis is present. The prosthesis is well
seated with normal leaflet motion and gradient. The effective 
orifice area index is moderately reduced
(0.65-0.90 cm2/m2). There is no aortic regurgitation. The mitral 
valve leaflets are mildly thickened with no
mitral valve prolapse. There is moderate to severe [3+] mitral 
regurgitation. A tricuspid annuloplasty ring is
present. The tricuspid annuloplasty ring is well seated, with 
thin and mobile leaflets and normal gradient.
There is a central jet of moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid 
regurgitation. There is mild-moderate pulmonary
artery systolic hypetension. There is no pericardial effusion. A 
left pleural effusion is present.
IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with 
normal cavity size and moderate to severe
global hypokinesis. Well seated, normal functioning 
bioprosthetic AVR with normal gradient and no aortic
regurgitation. Moderate to severe mitral regurgitation. Well 
seated tricuspid annuloplasty ring with mobile
leaflets and normal gradient. Moderate to severe tricuspid 
regurgitation. Mild-moderate pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ was admitted to the ___ on ___ for surgical 
management of her endocarditis affected valves. She underwent a 
coronary angiogram which showed no significant coronary artery 
disease. On ___ she was taken to the Operating Room where 
the she underwent tissue AVR/TVr.  Overall the patient tolerated 
the procedure well and post-operatively was transferred to the 
CVICU on Levo/vaso/epi. She received 3 PRBC for acute blood loss 
anemia in the immediate post-op period. She remained intubated 
for 48hrs. Extubated on POD3. She was started on Lasix gtt for 
aggressive diuresis. Developed post-op thrombocytopenia,  and 
was HIT negative. 
 Patient was weaned from all pressors/inotropess slowly. She was 
started on Lopressor POD3 and transitioned off her lasix gtt to 
IV bolus dosing. Her creat peaked at 1.9, and is trending back 
to baseline at 0.8 by the time of her discharge. 
  The patient was neurologically intact but remained weak and 
deconditioned. She was transferred to the telemetry floor for 
further recovery POD4.  Chest tubes and pacing wires were 
discontinued without complication. She was seen by speech and 
swallow and cleared for modified diet.  The patient was 
evaluated by the Physical Therapy service for assistance with 
strength and mobility.  By the time of discharge on POD #6 the 
patient was ambulating freely, the wound was healing and pain 
was controlled with oral analgesics.  The patient was discharged 
to ___ & ___ in good condition with 
appropriate follow up instructions.
