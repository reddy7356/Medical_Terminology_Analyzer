History of Present Illness:
 Ms. ___ is a ___ year old G0 who was transferred from
___ ___ with abdominal and pain and a right ovarian
mass. 

She reports waking up at 0200 on ___ with nausea and vomited one
time. She then went back to sleep. When she awoke later that
morning, she reports having lower mid abdominal pain along with
more left lower quadrant pain. She vomited about 4 times on
___. She took two doses of Tylenol for the pain and also
applied Bengay to her abdomen. She then reports that the next

pain. She does report that she ate potato salad for a ___
event but does not think anyone else has had the same symptoms
She presented to the ___ at 1300 for further work up
of the pain and nausea. At the OSH, she received 1000 mg IV
acetaminophen at 1600, 2mg IV morphine at 1610 and 4 mg IV
morphine at 1720. Her workup there was notable for a WBC count 
of
18.8, Hct 24.6 and normal lipase, LFTs, t bili. She underwent a
CT A/P which showed " a very large right ovarian mass which
likely is twisted on its pedicle as it traverses the midline and
ascends into the left mid abdomen. There is mild associated
infiltration of the perilesional fat and of the fat adjacent to
the ovarian pedicle. There is free fluid in the right lower
quadrant and deep pelvis. These findings suggest acute ovarian
torsion in association with a large ovarian mass. Excision of 
the
mass is advised. 2. There is a mild left pleural fluid 
collection
of unclear etiology.3. Likely right sided aortic arch. The arch
itself was not in the field-of-view. A right-sided aortic arch
carries with it and approximately 5% association with congenital
heart disease." 
She was then transferred to ___ ED for further work up of the
mass.

nap earlier now that she is back from ultrasound. She still

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ is a ___ G1P0 who initially presented on ___ with 
waxing and waning abdominal pain that acutely worsened on 
evening of HD#1. On evening of ___, she subseqeuently underwent 
a diagnostic laparoscopy, converted to ex lap, for right 
salipingoopherectomy.Please see the operative report for full 
details.

Ovarian torsion was noted and intra-op pathology returned as 
likely fibroma, final path pending. On admission she was noted 
to have anemia with nadir to 21.9 pre-op. She received 1 unit 
pRBCs pre-operatively with additional units held due to fever. 
On post-op day one her Hct was 20.9 and she received an 
additional unit pRBC with appropriate rise in Hct to 27.4. A 
chest x-ray performed on presentation identified a small to 
moderate L pl effusion, pulm vascular congestion w/o 
interstitial edema. She had an acute episode of oxygen 
desaturation and difficulty breathing on HD#1 at the time of her 
acutely-worsened pain. A CTA chest was obtained and ruled out 
PE. Repeat CXR POD#1 showed stable L pleural effusion w/ 
subsegmental atelectasis in LL base, trace R eff. She continued 
to have increased oxygen demands post-operatively and was placed 
on continuous O2 monitoring which noted saturations in the low 
___ on RA at baseline with desaturations to as low as high ___ 
while sleeping. Desaturations were concerning for undiagnosed 
OSA and CPAP was ordered for remainder of her hospital stay. She 
also received one dose of lasix for concern of pulmonary edema 
contributing to her oxygen requirements. Repeat CTA chest on 
___ showed no PE but did identify multifocal PNA for which she 
was started on Vancomycin empirically and narrowed to 
doxycycline and levoquin. During her stay she also had multiple 
episodes of severe HTN to >180/110s, requiring hydralazine for 
acute stabilization. Medicine was consulted and recommended she 
be started on amlodipine 5 mg, then increased to 10 mg, daily. 
Of note, we also obtained an echocardiogram to evaluate for 
heart failure in the context of persistent tachycardia and low 
O2 sats. The TTE was wnl. 

By post-operative day 4, she was tolerating a regular diet, 
ambulating independently, and pain was controlled with oral 
medications. She was then discharged home in stable condition 
with outpatient follow-up scheduled.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,

You were admitted to the gynecology service for management of a 
newly diagnosed pelvic mass. You underwent surgery, which found 
that the mass had caused your ovary to be twisted on itself. The 
mass involved your right ovary, and both were removed during 
your operation. Our initial pathology report suggests that the 
mass is most likely benign (non-cancerous), but you will go over 
the final report when you follow up in clinic with Dr. ___. 
After your procedure, there was concern about how well you were 
breathing. We obtained a number of tests, including a CT scan of 
your chest and an ultrasound of your heart, to evaluate what 
might be causing your lower oxygen levels. These imaging studies 
noted that there was some fluid on your lungs that might be 
contributing to your breathing issues, but overall we suspect 
this issue is related to sleep apnea. You have not previously 
been diagnosed with sleep apnea, and you will still need to be 
evaluated by a sleep medicine specialist to confirm this and 
treat you. The imaging studies also identified a pneumonia, and 
you were started on antibiotics to treat this. We will provide 
you with antibiotics that you will continue to take for a few 
days once you are home. Lastly, we had some concern about your 
high blood pressure and you were started on a daily medication 
(amlodipine) for this. Please continue to take this, and follow 
up with your PCP about your high blood pressure.

Overall, you have recovered well and the team believes you are 
ready to be discharged home. Please call Dr. ___ office with 
any questions or concerns. Please follow the instructions below.

Please make sure you contact your employer to obtain the 
necessary paperwork to excuse you from work for the next 6 
weeks. Please fax your forms to ___ and we will be able 
to fill it out for you.
