IMAGING/STUDIES
.
CXR ___: Lungs clear. There is no pulmonary 
edema,pneumothorax or pleural effusion. Heart size is normal. 
IMPRESSION: Normal radiograph. 
.
TTE ___: The left atrium is elongated. There is mild 
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size 
and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%). The estimated 
cardiac index is normal (>=2.5L/min/m2). Right ventricular 
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic arch is 
mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear 
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic 
regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are structurally 
normal. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral 
regurgitation is seen. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic 
pressure is high normal. There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Normal biventricular cavity sizes with preserved 
global and regional biventricular systolic function. Mild mitral 
regurgitation with normal valve morphology.
 
Brief Hospital Course:
This ___ with h/o HTN and prostate CA presents with 1d of 
lightheadedness, and found to be hypotensive with acute renal 
failure.
.
# Hypotension: Patient was found to be significantly below his 
baseline blood pressure on presentation. He received 
approximately 5L of NS in the ED and was admitted for monitoring 
overnight. He did not endorse any symptoms to suggest why he 
might be volume depleted; no recent medication changes, nausea, 
vomiting, diarrhea or bleeding.  The differential for his 
hypotension included vasovagal reaction, hypovolemia, PE, 
tamponade and cardiac ischemia.  He did not have any hypoxia or 
tachycardia, making suspicion for PE quite low.  Additionally, 
he did not have any evidence of tamponade based on normal pulsus 
and clear heart sounds. TTE showed no evidence of pump failure 
or effusion.  Although Troponin T was detectable, this was in 
the setting of acute renal failure.  Arrhythmia was also 
considered on the differential; he was monitored on telemetry 
overnight with no evidence of any abnormal heart rhythm. Thyroid 
function and cortisol were also within normal limits.  The 
patient's hypotension resolved after IV fluid, but he continued 
to have an SBP in the low 100s, which is significantly below his 
baseline.  He was instructed to hold his home antihypertensive 
regimen, as well as vasodilating medications such as sildenafil 
until seeing his PCP ___ ___ weeks.  
.
# Acute kidney injury: Most likely prerenal given his FeNa of 
0.7%. Likely secondary to significant volume depletion, as 
improved with IV fluid rehydration. 
.
# Anemia: The patient's Hct was 44 at presentation, which 
decreased to 35 after 5L of NS.  The patient was guaiac negative 
with no indication of bleeding, and it was felt that his Hct 
drop was most likely dilutional in nature.
.
# Hyperlipidemia: Patient was continued on home dose statin.
 
Medications on Admission:
Atorvastatin 20mg daily
Valsartan 320mg daily
HCTZ 25mg daily
ASA 81mg daily
Ibuprofen prn

Discharge Disposition:

Discharge Diagnosis:
Primary Diagnoses:
Hypotension
Normocytic anemia

 
Discharge Condition:
Mental Status:Clear and coherent
Level of Consciousness:Alert and interactive
Activity Status:Ambulatory - Independent

 
Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted to the hospital for dizziness and low blood 
pressure.  You were treated with IV fluids, and your symptoms 
and low blood pressure improved.  You also had some slight renal 
failure, which we think is related to dehydration (and improved 
with IV fluids).  Finally, you were found to have anemia, and we 
recommend that you undergo colonoscopy within the next ___ 
months. 

We made the following changes to your home medications:
- Please STOP valsartan, HCTZ and viagra for now (these 
medications may lower your blood pressure).  Please check your 
blood pressure within the next week, and if systolic pressure > 
140, you may restart valsartan and HCTZ.  
- Please make an appointment to see your pcp within the next ___ 
weeks, and have him check your kidney function to be sure that 
this abnormality resolves.
 
Followup Instructions:
___
