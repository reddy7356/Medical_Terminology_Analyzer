Pertinent Results:
___ EKG
Sinus rhythm. P-R interval prolongation. There is an atrial 
premature beat that blocks to the ventricle. All other P waves 
conduct despite a long P-R interval. There is left axis 
deviation. Possible left anterior fascicular block. Compared to 
the previous tracing of ___ the blocked atrial premature beat 
is new. The rate is now slower. 

___ EKG 
Sinus rhythm with atrial trigeminy. The atrial premature beat 
blocks to the ventricle. Left axis deviation. ST segment 
depression. Compared to the previous tracing atrial premature 
beats are now more frequent 

___ EKG 
Sinus rhythm with atrial trigeminy. The atrial premature beat 
blocks to the ventricle. Left axis deviation. ST segment 
depression. Compared to the previous tracing atrial premature 
beats are now more frequent 

CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST ___ 4:41 AM 
1. Large mixed density right subdural collection has decreased 
in size but remain substantial, up to 2.3 cm. Associated mass 
effect has partially improved. 2. New left subdural effusion. 
3. Extensive postsurgical bifrontal extra-axial pneumocephalus. 
4. Partially visualized large periapical lucency in the right 
maxilla, 
elevating the floor of the maxillary sinus with minimal mucosal 
thickening along the floor. No osseous defect in the maxillary 
sinus floor. 
  
  
___ CT head
1. No significant change in appearance of mixed density right 
subdural 
collection, with associated local mass effect and 4 mm leftward 
shift of the 
midline structures. 
2. Stable hypodense left subdural effusion. No new foci of 
intracranial 
hemorrhage is identified. 
3. Postsurgical changes related to right frontal craniotomy 
include extensive 
bifrontal extra-axial pneumocephalus, with redistribution into 
the 
extracranial soft tissues on the left. 

___ EKG
Sinus rhythm, rate about 100 with one dropped beat over the 
course of the 
tracing suggesting type I second degree A-V block. Since the 
previous tracing the atrial rate is now slower and block is less 
apparent. 

___ CT Head:
1. No change in the overall size of right subdural fluid 
collection; however, there is a enlarging component of 
organizing hematoma, concerning for interval and even active 
bleeding. 
2.  No other new site of hemorrhage or infarction. Decreased 
leftward midline shift. 
3.  No change in left-sided subdural fluid collection, which may 
represent a true hygroma. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ is a ___ year old male who was noted by his family
to have some difficulty ambulating since last week ___.
Patient is a resident at an ___
with his wife. The staff of the facility noted today that he had
difficulty lifting a cup with his L hand today. He was taken to
___ where a CT head was completed which 
revealed
an acute on chronic R SDH. Patient was transferred her for
further management. The patient was evaluated by neurosurgery 
and taken emergently to the operating room for evacuation of the 
subdural hematoma.   

On ___, The patient was called out to floor.  The patients left 
IP was ___ otherwise the patient was intact.  The patient was 
noted to be severely hard of hearing. The patient has a ___ 
post operatively that was consistent with expected post 
operative changes and was placed on a 100 % non rebreather. The 
serum sodium was 132.  Consultations for physical and 
occupational therapy were placed.  The patient was noted to have 
new onset2nd degree, Mobitz type I (___) AV block with 
disease likely within the AV node and cardiology was consulted.  
They did not recommend and intervention or change in the current 
treatment plan.  In the late afternoon the patient was noted to 
be more somulent and a Stat NCHCT was performed which was stable 
compared to prior study, improving pneumocephalus. Patient 
remained in ICU overnight. 

On ___ Patient much more alert and interactive. Non rebreather 
discontinued. Patient was transferred to the neurosurgical 
floor. He was noted to have a UTI and was started on bactrim

On ___ Patient remained neurologically stable. Physical therapy 
was consulted to evaluate the patient. He underwent an ECHO 
which shows normal Systolic function with an EF of 55 % and mild 
diastolic dysfunction. CXR showed mild to moderate pulmonary 
edema and he recieved 20mg of lasix on ___. 

On ___, the patient's Na was 131 and Phosphorous was 2.0. These 
electrolytes were repleted. The patient remained neurologically 
stable. 
His sodiums were trended daily and was 133 upon discharge.  He 
continued to remain stable neurologically. He had mild 
hypophosphatemia which was replaced accordingly.
