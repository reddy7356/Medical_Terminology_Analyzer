FINDINGS: 
  
  
LOWER CHEST: Moderately severe emphysematous changes of the 
lower lung bases are noted. 
  
ABDOMEN: Liver, pancreas, gallbladder, spleen, adrenals are 
unremarkable.  Abdominal aorta is moderately affective 
atherosclerotic disease, but not aneurysmally dilated. 
  
There is a high-grade small-bowel obstruction with massively 
dilated loops of small bowel measuring up to 6.5 cm.  The 
terminal ileum and initial portions of the cecum and ascending 
colon are noted to be inflamed with a thickened wall (02:43 and 
601:17). Point of transition occurs at the start of this 
inflammation (601:19). Large bowel is relatively collapsed. 
Appendix unremarkable.  No evidence of pneumatosis.  No 
hypoenhancing bowel wall. 
  
Small amount of abdominal and pelvic free fluid. 
  
PELVIS: Bladder is within normal limits.  Multiple surgical 
clips are seen in the pelvis presumed noted to partial 
prostatectomy. 
  
BONES AND SOFT TISSUES: No suspicious lytic or sclerotic 
lesions. Significant degenerative changes of the hips right 
greater the left.  Superior endplate compression deformity of 
the L1 vertebral body is stable. 
  
IMPRESSION:  
  
High-grade small bowel obstruction with the transition point 
beginning at a long segment of inflamed terminal ileum extending 
into the ascending colon compatible with ___ stricture. 
  
Moderately severe emphysematous changes of the lung bases. 
  
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist. 


___ Imaging ABDOMEN (SUPINE & ERECT)

Brief Hospital Course:
___ with h/o crohn's disease on pentasa, prostate cancer who 
presented with post-prandial abdominal pain on background of 
gradual anorexia and weight loss. 
 
#acute on chronic Crohn's disease.  
#Abdominal Pain: Initially considered a wide differential 
including PUD, gastritis, IBD flare. However, elevated CRP and 
MRE findings (skip lesions etc) confirmed acute on chronic 
Crohns disease. Hepatitis serologies as well as PPD (read 
___ negative. TPMT was sent and is PENDING at the time of 
discharge. The GI service was consulted and initially 
recommended bowel rest, IVF and IV steroids (20mg solumedrol 
q8hrs). ___ symptoms improved on this regimen and his diet was 
gradually advanced to a regular low residue diet. OF note, he 
was evaluated by nutrition to give education on a low residue 
diet and he was encouraged to drink boost or ensure TID given 
his weight loss. Pt was continued on pentasa. Upon discharge, 
___ IV steroids were discontinued and he was started on 9mg of 
budesonide to take daily at least until his outpatient GI follow 
up. GI may consider starting ___ if need be in the outpatient 
setting. If steroids will be prolonged, can consider starting 
calcium, vitamin D and bactrim for pcp ___. He was continued on 
mesalamine. 
.  
#anemia-no signs of acute bleeding. LIkely due to anemia of 
chronic disease per labs. Remained stable during admission. Labs 
revealed anemia of chronic disease. 
.  
#Weight loss:  
Pt reports has been over many years. Pt does not know how much 
weight he has lost and has not kept track of this. Considered 
both GI causes as well as known prostate cancer. However, pt has 
localized prostate ca per urology notation and this is more 
likely due to known active Crohn's disease. Nutrition was 
consulted for education and also recommended boost TID. 
.
#Prostate Cancer: PSA 3.5 during admission. Pt believed to have 
localized prostate ca and is already scheduled for an outpatient 
radical prostatectomy. Pt expressed concern about his GI 
treatment requiring steroids. The GI service has informed the 
urology service that pt will need to be on PO budesonide for at 
least 3 week's time pending his reevaluation with GI. In 
addition, other immunosuppressive agents may be added if 
indicated. The GI service does not feel that there needs to be a 
delay in surgery due to the steriods. However, Dr. ___ 
___ GI and Dr. ___ urologist should continue to 
discuss the best plan of action for the patient in terms of his 
IBD treatment and upcoming surgery.

CT ab/pelvis ___:
IMPRESSION:
1.  High-grade  small  bowel  obstruction  with  dilatation  of  
the  small  bowel
measuring  up  to  76  mm.  Etiology  of  obstruction  is  
somewhat  unclear.    Equivocal
mesenteric  swirling  ___  sign)  involving  decompressed 
 small  bowel  loops
just  distal  to  the  maximally  distended  small  bowel  can  
suggest  volvulus  as  the
obstructing  point  though  this  does  not  fit  the  clinical  
picture.    However,
wall  thickening  and  hyperemia  of  the  distal  involved  
small  bowel  suggests
___  involvement  as  the  far  more  likely  etiology.  
However,  this  finding
along  with  trace  ascites  is  can  be  seen  with  early  
ischemia.  Close  clinical
monitoring  and  emergent  surgical  consultation  is  advised.
2.  Anasarca.
3.  Centrilobular  emphysema.
4.  Bilateral  hip  configuration  suggestive  of  mixed  
pincer/CAM  type

bilateral
degenerative  hip  joint  change.

 
Brief Hospital Course:
 ___ hx ___ disease, prostate CA s/p prostatectomy, SBO 
presenting with LLQ pain and abdominal distention, SBO on 
imaging.
  
# Small bowel ___: Likely due to known 
stricturing ___. Less likely volvulus given pt not in 
significant pain. No e/o abdominal sepsis. Rapid recurrence and 
stricturing nature of disease points to the need for operative 
management. Malnourished. He was started on IV steroids, mIVF 
with dextrose, thiamine, folate, MVI. ___ held per GI. Attempts 
at diet advancement failed after NGT removed and the pt was 
transferred to the colorectal surgical service for a Small-bowel 
resection and ileocecectomy which he tolerated well. At the time 
of discharge he was tolerating PO, was passing flatus and having 
bowel movements. He will follow up in Colorectal surgery clinic 
and will continue to follow with his PCP and GI physicians.

# Osteoporosis: Cont vit D, Ca held as it interfered with Phos 
repletion.

# Nutrition: Pt was started on TPN while in the hospital, which 
he tolerated well. Post op he was began on a clear diet, then 
transitioned to a regular diet, which he tolerated well. His 
PICC was d/ced prior to discharge 

# Pneumonia: He was treated for Hospital acquired pneumonia with 
vancomycin and Levofloxicin, which he tolerated well.

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted to the hospital after a small bowel resection 
and ileocecectomy for surgical management of your ___ 
bowel obstruction. You have recovered from this procedure well 
and you are now ready to return home. Samples from your colon 
were taken and this tissue has been sent to the pathology 
department for analysis. You will receive these pathology 
results at your follow-up appointment. If there is an urgent 
need for the surgeon to contact you regarding these results they 
will contact you before this time. You have tolerated a regular 
diet, passing gas and your pain is controlled with pain 
medications by mouth. You may return home to finish your 
recovery.
                            
Please monitor your bowel function closely. You may or may not 
have had a bowel movement prior to your discharge which is 
acceptable, however it is important that you have a bowel 
movement in the next ___ days. After anesthesia it is not 
uncommon for patient’s to have some decrease in bowel function 
but you should not have prolonged constipation. Some loose stool 
and passing of small amounts of dark, old appearing blood are 
expected. However, if you notice that you are passing bright red 
blood with bowel movements or having loose stool without 
improvement please call the office or go to the emergency room 
if the symptoms are severe. If you are taking narcotic pain 
medications there is a risk that you will have some 
constipation. Please take an over the counter stool softener 
such as Colace, and if the symptoms do not improve call the 
office. If you have any of the following symptoms please call 
the office for advice or go to the emergency room if severe: 
increasing abdominal distension, increasing abdominal pain, 
nausea, vomiting, inability to tolerate food or liquids, 
prolonged loose stool, or extended constipation.
 
You have a long vertical incision on your abdomen that is closed 
with staples. This incision can be left open to air or covered 
with a dry sterile gauze dressing if the staples become 
irritated from clothing. The staples will stay in place until 
your first post-operative visit at which time they can be 
removed in the clinic, most likely by the office nurse. Please 
monitor the incision for signs and symptoms of infection 
including: increasing redness at the incision, opening of the 
incision, increased pain at the incision line, draining of 
white/green/yellow/foul smelling drainage, or if you develop a 
fever. Please call the office if you develop these symptoms or 
go to the emergency room if the symptoms are severe. You may 
shower, let the warm water run over the incision line and pat 
the area dry with a towel, do not rub.
 
No heavy lifting for at least 6 weeks after surgery unless 
instructed otherwise by Dr. ___ Dr. ___. You may 
gradually increase your activity as tolerated but clear heavy 
exercise ________.
 
You will be prescribed a small amount of the pain medication 
oxycodone. Please take this medication exactly as prescribed. 
You may take Tylenol as recommended for pain. Please do not take 
more than 4000mg of Tylenol daily. Do not drink alcohol while 
taking narcotic pain medication or Tylenol. Please do not drive 
a car while taking narcotic pain medication.
 
Thank you for allowing us to participate in your care! Our hope 
is that you will have a quick return to your life and usual 
activities. Good luck!

He has had no urologic issues since we last saw him. He has had  

a Crohn's flare, for which he is actively seeking treatment from 
 
his primary care physician and ___ ___ physician.  
We discussed the findings of his MRI, which showed no evidence 
on  
the MR of any osseous lesions in the pelvis. There was some  
degenerative joint disease of the hips noted. The findings also  

detailed. Findings consistent with prostate cancer in the right  

lobe of the prostate. The patient's MR of the prostate shows  
gland-confined disease throughout the right lobe of the prostate 
 
gland, which is stage II, T2b on MRI. There was no evidence of  
extracapsular extension on the study.  
His bone scan shows mild focus of activity in the left ischium  
that was not definitely seen on prior study. This again was not  

seen on the MRI and therefore is not a concern for metastatic  
disease.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ was admitted to the Urology Service after undergoing 
radical prostatectomy with bilateral obturator lymph node 
dissection. No concerning intra-operative events occurred; 
please see dictated operative note for full details.  The 
patient received ___ antibiotic prophylaxis.  At the 
end of the procedure the patient was extubated and transported 
to the PACU for further recovery before being transferred to the 
floor.  He was transferred from the PACU in stable condition. On 
POD0-1, pain was well controlled on PCA, hydrated with 
intravenous fluids for urine output >30cc/hour, provided with 
pneumoboots and incentive spirometry for prophylaxis, and he 
ambulated once. On POD1, the patient was restarted on home 
medications, basic metabolic panel and complete blood count were 
checked, pain control was transitioned from PCA to oral 
analgesics, diet was advanced to a clears/toast and crackers 
diet for breakfast and lunch.  Hematocrit dropped to less than 
25 and he was given two units of packed red blood cells on POD2 
and monitored until POD3--date of discharge. Diet was advanced 
to regular after lunch and with further ambulation.  JP drain 
was removed prior to discharge on POD3.  Foley catheter care and 
leg bag teaching was provided by nursing. The remainder of the 
hospital course was unremarkable. The patient was discharged in 
stable condition, eating well, ambulating independently, and 
with pain control on oral analgesics. On exam, incision was 
clean, dry, and intact, with no evidence of hematoma collection 
or infection. The patient was given explicit instructions to 
follow-up in one week for post-operative evaluation and trial of 
voiding.
