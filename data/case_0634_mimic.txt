Chief Complaint:
Right infrascapular pain and a right Horner's
 
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Lumbar puncture under fluroscopic guidance

 
History of Present Illness:
Ms. ___ is a ___ right-handed woman with a history of 
PMR and CLL who presents with right scapular pain, vague right 
arm sensory changes, and a right sided Horner syndrome. She 
noticed pain over her right scapula about 4 days ago - it's a 
sharp pain located just lateral to the medial inferior border of
the right scapula, without radiation, worsened with turning her 
head to the right. No relief with ibuprofen, some relief with 
Oxycodone. She went to see her rheumatologist, who felt it was 
not related to her PMR. She came to the ED today because the 
pain was too intense to bear. It is relieved with narcotics.

She also over the same time period began noticing sensory 
changes over her medial forearm and ulnar portion of her hand. 
She has difficulty describing it, saying it's not truly numb, 
but feels strange when she touches that area. She also complains 
of weakness in her right hand, noticeable when she tries to type 
or open jars.

Finally, yesterday her daughter noticed that her right pupil was 
smaller than her left, and felt that her right eyelid was 
droopier than usual. The patient herself did not notice this. 
It's unclear when this truly started, as her daughter saw her 
for the first time in several days yesterday.
  
On neuro ROS, Ms. ___ denies headache, loss of vision, blurred 
vision, diplopia, dysarthria, dysphagia, lightheadedness, 
vertigo, tinnitus or hearing difficulty. Denies difficulties 
producing or comprehending speech.  Other than that mentioned 
above, she denies focal weakness, numbness, parasthesiae. No
bowel or bladder incontinence or retention. Denies difficulty 
with gait.

On general review of systems, she denies recent fever or chills. 
 No night sweats or recent weight loss or gain. Denies cough, 
shortness of breath.  Denies chest pain or tightness, 
palpitations.  Denies nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation 
or abdominal pain.  No recent change in bowel or bladder habits. 
 No dysuria.  Denies arthralgias or myalgias. Denies rash.

CT chest with contrast ___
1. No mediastinal or lung mass. 
2. Scattered non-calcified sub-4-mm lung nodules. According to 
the 
___ guidelines, in a low-risk patient, no further 
followup is needed. If risk factors exist, recommend CT in 12

Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs ___ was admitted with a right Horner's syndrome and right 
infrascapular pain.  This is felt to be most likely secondary to 
a lower brachial plexopathy.  Extensive evaluation revealed no 
evidence of a brachial plexus or cervical spine / root mass, and 
her CSF showed no evidence of malignancy.  On two occasions she 
was noticed to have hypokalemia, and she will follow-up with her 
PCP ___ to have this investigated further. She has 
C4/C5 degenerative disc disease. Her bed-side lumbar puncture 
failed, and she had to have an X-ray guided (fluoroscopy) lumbar 
puncture.  She will follow up with Dr. ___ as an outpatient, 
and will have an EMG and NCV to further evaluate the brachial 
plexus.
