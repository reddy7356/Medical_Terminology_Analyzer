History of Present Illness:
The pt is a ___ who presents with one week of waxing/wanning
right sided headache and found to have right-sided transverse
sinus thrombosis on MRV.

She was in her usual state until roughly one week prior when she
noted the onset of a persistent headache. She does not have a
history of migraine and cannot pinpoint the exact time when the
headache started but believes it was a gradual onset. At times
the headache was particularly pronounced in intensity such as
when she would cough or sneeze and especially when she would 
bend
over. The pain was describes as constant but at times throbbing,
varied in intensity between ___. The pain was focused in the
right posterior auricular / right occiput but at times would be
distributed over the entire right head into her right orbit,
nasal cavity and neck. She denies vertigo, vision changes,
nausea, phono/photophobia. She denies trauma to head/neck. 

The pain would intermittently improve with the use of OTC pain
relievers. However, earlier this morning at roughly 2am she woke
up with tremendous pain and felt that she needed to go to
hospital. She presented to ___ and underwent CT which was
initially read as normal. She was given toradol/benedryl and
phenergen which led to a substantial improvement in the symptoms
of pain. She returned home but was called because of a final 
read
of the CT which showed possible venous sinus clot. She returned
for an MRV which showed a right transverse sinus thrombus and 
was
then transfered to ___.  

of note, she experienced a flu-like episode with fever/chills
perhaps 1 month ago but felt that she had fully recovered and 
she
currently denies recent fevers/chills. 

Also of note, 4 months prior she restarted estradiol FEmring
(vaginal insert) for menopausal symptoms. She also continues to
smoke perhaps 1 pk/day. 
 

On neuro ROS, the pt denies loss of vision, blurred vision,
diplopia, dysarthria, dysphagia, lightheadedness, vertigo,
tinnitus or hearing difficulty. Denies difficulties producing or
comprehending speech.  Denies focal weakness, numbness,
parasthesiae. No bowel or bladder incontinence or retention.
Denies difficulty with gait.

 
On general review of systems, the pt denies recent fever or
chills.  No night sweats or recent weight loss or gain. Denies
cough, shortness of breath.  Denies chest pain or tightness,
palpitations.  Denies nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation 
or
abdominal pain.  No recent change in bowel or bladder habits.  
No
dysuria.  Denies arthralgias or myalgias. Denies rash.

Pertinent Results:
CXR ___:

Fibrotic or atelectatic streaks are seen in the left mid to 
lower zone and there is scoliosis of the thoracic spine convex 
to the right.  However, no evidence of acute pneumonia or 
vascular congestion. 

Jugular vein ultrasounds ___:

 Grayscale and color Doppler examination of the bilateral 
jugular 
Preliminary Reportveins reveals normal compressibility, 
waveform, and color flow. 
 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
This is a ___ year old right handed woman with a long history of 
smoking and recent addition of estrogen vaginal ring who 
presents with one week of right occipital headache. Found to 
have a right transverse venous thrombosis on MRV at ___.  
MRI features suggest that this thrombosis ight be several days 
old (signal is bright on T1-weighted images). US of her jugular 
vein does not show any clot in this vein. Thus, the thrombosis 
was restricted to the transverse sinus.

NEURO: The patient was admitted to the stroke service. He 
neurologic exam remained fully intact. She was started on a 
heparin drip to prevent extension of the thrombosis. This was 
later transitioned to coumadin with lovenox bridge in 
anticipation of discharge. The patient had a chest xray to 
screen for lung cancer given her long smoking history and lung 
cancer could be another cause of increased coagulability. This 
CXR showed stable changes consistent with known COPD. She was 
also tested for other indicators of hypercoagulability including 
Anticardiolipin Antibody (pending) and ___ Microglobulin 
(1.4). DDimer was elevated at 1039 but this is expected in the 
setting of a clot. While the patient will have the remaining 
hypercoagulable workup as an outpatient, the cause of her clot 
is likely the combination of smoking and estrogen 
supplementation.

The patient's headache persisted while admitted. Tramadol and 
oxycodone were not helpful. The patient was started on 
gabapentin and oral morphine for breahthrough pain which worked 
better. Pain level was ___ on the morning of discharge.

ID: The patient had a low grade temp to 100.3 max while 
admitted. She had a clean dipstick urinalysis and no 
leukocytosis. CXR was also not suggestive of infection. Her low 
grade temperature is likely due to the inflammatory reaction 
from the clot.

HEME: The patient reported "black, tarry" stool on the day of 
discharge. Rectal exam revealed no masses, and dark, guaiac 
negative stool.
 
PSYCH: The patient has a history of anxiety. She was continued 
on all of her usual medications. She was very anxious during 
admission which likely contributed to her headache.

Transitions of Care Issure: Complete hypercoagulable work up as 
below. Follow up MRV in ___ months to determine if there is any 
recanalization and to determine if she needs continued Coumadin. 
Follow up with Neurology as below. Stop lovenox and continue 
with Coumadin once INR is between ___.

Discharge Disposition:
Home
 
Discharge Diagnosis:
Right transverse sinus venous thrombosis

 
Discharge Condition:
Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Level of Consciousness: Alert and interactive.
Activity Status: Ambulatory - Independent.
No neurologic deficits on discharge.

 
Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted to the hospital for a transverse venous sinus 
thrombosis on the right side. This was causing your headache. 
You were placed on IV heparin to protect you from potential 
complications from this clot. You will continue on a blood 
thinner called coumadin at home for at least 6 months. Coumadin 
takes up to a week to start working so in the meantime you will 
be on Lovenox shots until your INR reaches ___. Your PCP has 
agreed to follow your INR at regular blood draws. It is 
important that you protect yourself from cuts or falls while you 
are on this medication as it makes you prone to bleed. 

You should have tests for genetic hypercoagulable conditions as 
an outpatient. This can be arranged with your PCP. You should 
also avoid all natural or synthetic estrogen supplements. Most 
importantly you should immediately stop smoking. Failure to do 
so puts your health and life at serious risk.
