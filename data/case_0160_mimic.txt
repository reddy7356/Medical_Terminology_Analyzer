Chief Complaint:
back pain
 
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

 
History of Present Illness:
Ms. ___ is a ___ year old woman with history of L5-S1 disc
herniation (diagnosed several months ago), who presents with
acute worsening of her lower back pain.

Has been seen for her lower back pain as an outpatient. Was
prescribed muscle relaxers and ___ was recommended. Her baseline
pain is a sharp shooting pain which extends down the back of 
both
legs and around to the knees on both sides (R>L), associated 
with
pain in the R>L lower back. Did traction with ___ a couple days
before presentation.

On the morning of presentation, she woke up with significant
worsening of her lower back pain. She noticed a similar
distribution of the pain, but more intense, and now extending
down to the feet as well and associated with numbness of both
feet. She also felt that she could not urinate that morning.
Based on this sudden worsening of symptoms, she presented to
Sturdy ED. MRI there showed her known small disc herniation at
L5-S1 without canal stenosis or foraminal stenosis. She was
transferred to ___ for further evaluation.

In the ED,  
- Initial Vitals:  T 98, HR 104, BP 140/88, spO2 96% RA

- Exam:  
Back- TTP L4-S1, Pain with straight leg to 20 degrees ___,
decreases sensation to light touch on ___ LEs, Decreased perianal
sensation, decreased rectal tone (later reported to be intact
when evaluated by neurosurgery)
Neuro-A&O x3, CN ___ intact, normal strength and sensation in
all extremities, normal speech

- Labs:  WBC 12.7 (58% PMN), Na 134, labs otherwise unremarkable

- Consults:  Neurosurgery, who found her neurologic exam to be
reassuring (with full strength, intact reflexes, rectal tone, 
and
minimally diminished sensation over the right dorsal/lateral
foot, right anteiror thigh, and left perianal area), and after
personally reviewing her imaging from ___, determined that no
neurosurgical intervention was necessary at that time.

- Interventions: She received IV dilaudid (x2), PO 
acetaminophen,
IV zofran, IV morphine (x3), 1L IV NS, lidocaine patch, and her
home fluoxetine. A foley was placed after arrival to the ___
for new urinary retention, but was removed before time of
admission, and she subsequently voided successfully.

Based on persistent pain requiring IV pain meds, and new
worsening numbness of the bilateral feet, she was admitted to
medicine for further management.

Upon arrival to the floor, the patient endorsed having urinated
after removal of the foley. She confirms the above story, and
endorses significant pain.
