ECG ___: Sinus rhythm. Prlonged P-R interval with 
ventricular pacing. Compared to the previous tracing of ___ 
there is now ventriclar pacing.  

CXR ___: 
FINDINGS:  There is moderate cardiomegaly with mildly tortuous 
thoracic aorta. The central pulmonary vasculature is engorged 
with ill-defined borders and diffuse increased reticulation 
compatible with moderate pulmonary edema. There is no pleural 
effusion or pneumothorax.  A left-sided dual-lead pacer is 
unchanged in position compared to ___. 
  
IMPRESSION:  Moderate cardiomegaly with moderate interstitial 
pulmonary edema. No focal consolidation to suggest superimposed 
pneumonia. 

ECHOCARDIOGRAM ___
The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left 
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size. There is mild 
regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with hypokinesis 
of the distal half of the anterior septum and anterior walls. 
The apex is mildly dyskinetic. The remaining segments contract 
normally (LVEF = 45 %). No intraventricular thrombus is seen. 
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular 
filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size 
and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) 
appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no 
aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve 
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve 
prolapse. Mild to moderate (___) mitral regurgitation is seen. 
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is 
no pericardial effusion. 

IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with 
mild regional systolic dysfunction c/w CAD (mid-LAD 
distribution). Mild-moderate mitral regurgitation. Pulmonary 
artery hypertension. Increased PCWP. 

CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: 
Based on ___ AHA endocarditis prophylaxis recommendations, the 
echo findings indicate prophylaxis is NOT recommended. Clinical 
decisions regarding the need for prophylaxis should be based on 
clinical and echocardiographic data.  
 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ year old male with complete heart block s/p dual chamber 
___ pacemaker placement in ___ who presents with 
exertional chest pain and dyspnea found to have troponin 
elevation and EKG changes c/w NSTEMI in setting of new anemia.

# NSTEMI 
The patient presented due to ___ days of exertional chest 
pressure. Last episode of chest pain on ___. EKG is 
significant for concordant ST changes in V3-V5 and initial 
troponin was elevated to 0.2--> 0.19. The patient is chest pain 
free at rest, and upon admission. Pt likely had an acute 
coronary event, possibly exacerbated by demand mismatch in 
setting of anemia below. Pt did not want cardiac 
catheterization. He completed 48 hours of heparin drip and 
loaded with plavix. Given his likely chronic GI bleed (see 
below), upon discharge plavix was stopped, and the pt was 
maintained on aspirin 81 and metoprolol succinate 50mg. Echo on 
___ showed reduced LVEF 45% with hypokinesis of the distal half 
of the anterior septum and anterior walls, as well as apical 
dyskinesis. He was still feeling lightheaded when walking 
around, so addition of ACE-I was deferred to PCP.  

# Pulmonary edema: CXR showed moderate interstial edema. Pt 
denied orthopnea or PND, though pt did receive lasix 20 mg IV x 
1 for dyspnea on exertion. Likely flash pulmonary edema in 
setting of myocardial stunning from NSTEMI +/- new post-MI 
cardiomyopathy. On day of discharge, pt appeared euvolemic on 
exam. Pt's weight upon discharge was 200 lbs. He was still 
feeling slightly weak, his baseline over the past few months.

# Fe deficiency anemia (MCV 86)
Patient noted to have a Hct drop to 30.4 from baseline of 41.6 
in ___. Previous baseline in high ___. He endorses 
lightheadedness and weakness x months but denies melena or 
bloody stools. Ferritin 21, iron 15, c/w iron deficiency anemia. 
Stool noted to be soft, brown but guiac positive. Hemolysis labs 
negative. Likely chronic GI bleed, consider hemorrhoids, AVM, 
though normocytic anemia may represent mixed picture. Hct 
remained stable while on heparin drip and plavix. Pt started on 
Fe 325mg daily with senna/colace bowel regimen. PTP to follow up 
outpatient work up.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES
- Pt newly diagnosed with heart failure, LVEF 45%, not 
discharged on ACE-I given global picture (elderly pt who was 
hesitant to take new medication; lightheadedness from anemia). 
Deferring decision to initiate ACEI to PCP.
- Pt with new Fe deficiency anemia; discharged on Fe 325mg and 
bowel regimen. PCP to follow up with possible GI work up.

Discharge Condition:
Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Level of Consciousness: Alert and interactive.
Activity Status: Ambulatory - Independent.

 
Discharge Instructions:
It was a pleasure to take care of you during your stay at ___. 
You came in with chest pain, and we found that you had a small 
heart attack. We treated you with a blood thinner called heparin 
for 2 days. We also started you on a medication called 
metoprolol, to lower blood pressure and heart rate, and decrease 
the stress on the heart. We did an ultrasound of the heart which 
showed you had a mild decrease in heart function. We would like 
you to continue taking aspirin 81mg, and to also take metoprolol 
now. 

You were also feeling very weak and lightheaded. We found that 
your blood count was low. We found that there was occult blood 
in your stool, possibly due to hemorrhoids. You have a new 
anemia because you are slowly losing blood from your GI tract. 
When you chronically lose, blood, your bone marrow has to work 
hard to keep making blood, and eventually uses up all your iron 
stores to generate more blood. You iron stores are very 
depleted, so we recommend that you take an iron tablet daily to 
help your bone marrow make more blood. Once your blood counts 
are better, you may feel less weak and lightheaded. You should 
follow up with your PCP to see how we can stop the chronic blood 
loss from the GI tract. This may involve a colonoscopy.

sinus massage, had approx 3 seconds sinus pause, then sinus rate 
50-60 ___onduction for approx 10 seconds, then resumed 
sinus rhythm.    No prior ECG available for comparison.

Telemetry had no further events besides occasional PVCs.  He 
remained in normal sinus rhythm
 
Brief Hospital Course:
Patient is a ___ yo male with no significant medical history who 
presents with symptomatic AV disassociation with ventricular 
rate approx 40 now in sinus rhythm 
   
#. Rhythm: The patient was admitted for symptomatic AV 
disassociation consistent with AV nodal dysfunction.  The 
patient underwent carotid sinus massage in the ED by the 
cardiology fellow and subsequently developed approximately 10 
seconds of no ventricular beats.  He then returned to normal 
sinus rhythm, and remained in that rhythm for the remainder of 
his hospitalization.  The patient was not any medications to 
suggest drug cause.  There was no evidence of ischemia on his 
ECG.  The patient had no other symptoms, and denies previous 
symptoms similar to his presentation.  The Electrophysiology 
service recommended that he have a pacemaker placed, but the 
patient refused.  We also discussed our recommendation with the 
health care proxy, who also agreed with pacemaker placement, but 
respected the patient's wishes since the patient does have 
decision making capacity and is functional at home.  We 
recommended that the patient have ___ of Hearts monitor prior 
to discharge, and the patient be evaluated by his PCP and to 
discuss whether he'd like a pacemaker placed as an outpatient.  
He agreed to this plan.  He will followup with Dr. ___ in 
clinic to review the results of his ___ monitor and to discuss 
pacemaker placement.  The patient was advised that he should not 
drive under any circumstance.  Also, we informed the patient 
that if this were to occur again in the future, it may be fatal. 
 The patient understands this risk, and will discuss further 
options with his family and PCP as an outpatient. The patient 
will be discharged home on a stool softener to prevent increased 
vagal tone during bowel movements.

week and readmission due to lightheadedness.  
.  
#. Rhythm: Patient has pacemaker placed, per telemetry and EKG, 
appeared to be paced rhythm, some native beats. His rate has 
been in the 60's to ___.  
- His pain was managed with percocet as needed. He had no pain 
at time of discharge.
- He was discharged on a course of keflex to prevent infection.  
 
- A chest x-ray confirmed placement of the leads.
- The devices was interogated prior to discharge and found to be 
working properly.
- Follow up was arranged in device clinic in one week's time to 
assess the device. He was also scheduled to follow up in 
cardiology clinic.
.  
#. Coronary artery disease: Patient has no documented coronary 
artery disease. He was continued on 81 mg of aspirin daily for 
prevention.  
.  
#. Pump: No documented ejection fraction. He had no evidence of 
congestive heart failure on history or exam. He continued to 
appear euvolemic on exam.  
.  
# Hypertension:  
Patient has no reported history of hypertension, but was noted 
to have a systolic blood pressure in 200's while in the in the 
lab during device placement. His systolic blood pressure was 
180's on arrival to the wards and 160's on first meeting the 
patient when at rest.  
It has been noted that he appears to have an element of 
agitation that relates to elevated blood pressure, as previously 
it went from 160 to 180 as the patient became angry.  During his 
stay, his blood pressure remained elevated in the 160s-180s 
range.
Given persistently elevated blood pressure, a low dose of 
amlodipine (2.5 mg), was initiated to avoid any effect of 
diuretic contributing to orthostatic hypotension.  
Patient should follow up with his primary care provider and in 
cardiology clinic for further blood pressure medication 
titration and adjustment.
