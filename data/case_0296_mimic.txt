IMAGING
======================
CATH ___
Interventional Details
Emergency coronary angiography demonstrated reocclusion of the 
previously placed proximal LAD stent with extensive thrombus. 
After administering additional IV heparin and tirofiban, the LAD 
lesion was crossed with a .014 Prowater wire. Thrombectomy was 
attempted but could not be passed. We then redilated the LAD 
stent with a 3.5 mm balloon, re-establishing antegrade flow. 
IVUS was then performed which demonstrated underexpansion of the 
ostial portion of the stent. We then redilated the LAD ostium
with a 4.0 mm and a 4.5 mm NC balloon up to 20 atm. Repeat IVUS 
then demonstrated good stent expansion without any residual 
dissection. The final angiographic result demonstrated 0% 
residual stenosis, normal flow, and no residual dissection. The 
previously noted 60% long mid LAD lesion did not appear flow 
limiting and was not treated.
Impressions:
Successful emergency re-PTCA of proximal LAD stent thrombosis, 
treated with successful IVUS-guided repeat PTCA

___ CXR
There is no evidence of pneumonia, pulmonary edema, pleural 
effusion or 
pneumothorax. 
  
___ TTE
There is moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction 
with severe hypokinesis to akinesis of the anteroseptal, 
anterior, and distal septal and lateral walls, and apex. The 
apex appears trabeculated. A left ventricular thrombus is not 
seen, but cannot exclude a small thrombus in the apex. The 
remaining segments contract normally (LVEF = 40 %). Overall left 
ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed. Right 
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. Trace 
aortic regurgitation is seen. Trivial mitral regurgitation is 
seen. There is an anterior space which most likely represents a 
prominent fat pad. 

 Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of ___, 
left ventricular systolic function is similar.  

___ CXR
Lungs are clear.  Small bilateral effusions are seen.  Heart 
size is Mildly  enlarged but unchanged.  No pneumothorax is 
seen.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable.

for post STEMI monitoring.

ACUTE ISSUES:
=======================
#ANTERIOR STEMI
No prior cardiac history, presented with severe substernal chest 
pain of one hour, found to have STE in V3-V5. Taken to cath lab 
and found to have proximal LAD occlusion and received DES x1 to 
LAD. Immediately after the procedure he developed recurrent 
chest pain and persistent STE EKG changes, so another 
catheterization was performed, which showed in stent thrombosis 
requiring balloon angioplasty. After cath had recurrent CP 
similar to presentation in terms of location and character, and 
again associated with nausea/diaphoresis/SOB. He also developed 
hypoxia with a new O2 requirement of ___ O2/min. CXR showed 
vascular congestion supporting possibility of flash pulmonary 
edema given worsened EF from LAD infarct, and he received IV 
Lasix with good effect. No STE or PR depressions on serial EKG. 
Bedside echo ruled out pericardial effusions, free wall rupture, 
or papillary rupture without signs of MR that could explain 
flash edema. He was briefly on tirofiban and his symptoms 
improved, presumed to be due to post-MI pericarditis. A1c 5.4, 
LDL 134. Formal TTE with EF 48%, diffuse LV hypokinesis. Pt 
continued to have SOB on inspiration, likely ___ to side effect 
of ticagrelor, so ticagrelor was discontinued and he was 
re-loaded with Plavix and continued on daily plavix. He was also 
started on atorvastatin, aspirin, metroprolol and an Lisinopril.

___
Cr to peak of 1.3, Baseline Cr ~ 1.0. Likely multifactorial with 
lack of PO intake, contrast load and initiation of ACE. 
Creatinine was 1.1 on the day of discharge. 

#Leukocytosis and cough. Patient remained afebrile and with no 
consolidation on chest x-ray, but did have a cough and 
leukocytosis. He was started on five days of azithromycin (D1: 
___ for CAP. 

CHRONIC ISSUES:
