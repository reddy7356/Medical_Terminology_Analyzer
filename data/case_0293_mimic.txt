Brief Hospital Course:
His exam is notable for a regular rhythm. He has a left sided 
weakness affecting both the arm and leg in a predominantly upper 
motor neuron pattern and the distal hand most affected.  Speech 
is mildy dysarthric. There are no sensory symptoms or objective 
sensory findings other than mild symmetric loss of 
proprioceptive and vibratory sense.  He does have mild right 
facial ptosis and deepening of right NLF. In addition, he has 
some muscle spasms in his right cheek region. 

His head CT shows small vessel disease as well as bilateral 
lacunae within the basal ganglia. There is no evidence of 
hemorrhage. MRI showed a small diffusion lesion extending from 
the Posterior Limb of the Internal Capsule to the 
paraventricular region on the right.

Overall, we felt this was a small vessel infarct. We started him 
on ASA 325mg, checked his lipids and HbA1c. He is on Crestor and 
will increase his dose. 
Telemetry monitoring ruled out arrhythmia. He was also ruled out 
for MI. He may complete his work up once in ___ with a TTE.
