History of Present Illness:
 ___ with CAD s/p MI ___ with stent x1, 1V CABG (?LAD) in 
___ at ___ who presents with chest pain which 
has been present since her surgery. The patient was in her USOH 
until ___ or ___ when she noted progressive anginal 
symptoms with exertion. She underwent a stress test at ___ on 
___ during which she experienced crushing CP similar to prior 
MI. Cath was performed ___ which showed disease requiring CABG 
(? ___ LAD). She underwent CABG on ___ and the surgery was 
uneventful. She had post-op sternal pain which eventually 
resolved but also noted continued central heaviness which had 
been her anginal pain prior to surgery. She states she made her 
doctors aware of this but was discharged to home. The pain 
persisted over the next couple months intermittently and she was 
seen by her cardiologist in ___. EKG was concerning to him 
so she was sent back into ___ and admitted. She underwent cath 
again which showed that the graft was down and she had 75% 
stenosis at the site of previous stent from ___. No 
intervention was performed and she was discharged to home with 
plan to follow up with cardiologist for further management this 
week. Her pain persisted and she did not wish to return to ___ 
for further care and presented to ___. No fevers or chills. No 
vomiting, diarrhea. The pain is sometimes pleuritic, worse with 
exertion, associated with nausea, diaphoresis, SOB and feels 
similar to her prior MI. She also has sharp pains which radiate 
into her L scapula lasting seconds a/w this. She also reports 
feeling the need to gasp for air throughout the day since her 
surgery. Finally, the patient had noted some lumps in her L 
breast approx. ___ year ago and no biopsies were taken after 
mammogram was somewhat suspicious. SHe was supposed to follow up 
for this but has not and the lumps have become painful and 
larger over the past month. Also endorses 28lb weight loss over

3. Limited resting hemodynamics revealed a central aortic 
pressure of 
111/69 mmHg. 
4. Pressure wire of the proximal LAD 50% ISR was performed.

hyperemia was achieved using IV adenosine. With maximal 
hyperemia the 
FFR was 0.93. 
5. OCT evaluation of the proximal LAD was performed. OCT 
analysis 
revealed a moderate in-stent restenosis of 50%. 
6. Angiography of the right femoral arteriotomy site was 
performed and 
showed a site which was compatible with percutaneous closure. A 
___ Fr 
Angioseal VIP device was used to obtain closure of the ___ Fr R 
arteriotomy site with good resultant hemostasis. 
  
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:     
1. Coronary arteries have no flow limiting disease. 
2. Patent LIMA to LAD . 
3. Negative FFR evaluation of the proximal LAD re-stenosis. 
 
Brief Hospital Course:
 ___ with strong FH of early CAD, recent tobacco abuse, known MI 
in ___ with stent placement and recent CABG in ___ with 
known failed graft who presents with continued CP similar to 
prior MI since CABG.  
 
# Chest Pain: Patient presented with CP that sounded somewhat 
anginal in nature which had been ongoing since her CABG in 
___ and pain was not worse or different at admission. She 
ruled out for ACS with EKG and enzymes. Records from ___ 
___ revealed CABG in ___ was LIMA to LAD. Prior to that, 
she had had Cypher stent placed to LAD in ___. Her cath in ___ 
had showed 50% ostial LAD lesion with neg remodeling, FFR 0.85, 
LVEF 40%. Her cath in ___ prior to CABG showed no RCA or LCx 
disease, 50 vs 70% (indeterminate) ostial stenosis of LAD with 
aneurysmal dilation around stent, FFR <0.75. MIBI in ___ 
after CABG was neg for ischemia. ___ cath at ___ showed 
40% ostial stenosis, patent stent with negative remodeling in 
___ LAD, LIMA to LAD graft patent but atretic. After careful 
review of all these records, the decision was made to proceed 
with repeat diagnostic cath to perform advanced diagnostic 
techniques on the LAD stensosis, including FFR. Cath showed that 
there would not be a benefit to re-stenting. LIMA-LAD graft was 
patent and functioning. The patient's CP was improved at 
discharge. She was also started on Imdur for anginal pain. She 
will follow up with Dr. ___.
 
# Breast lumps: Patient with known breast lumps that have 
increased in size and are now painful and associated with L 
axillary pain. Also endorses >25lb wt loss unintentionally over 
last year, though also with decreased appetite and signif. life 
stressors. Mammogram and L breast U/S in ___ showed BIRADS-1. 
The importance of her having close follow up for her breast 
center being coordinated by her new PCP was stressed and she 
will obtain previous imaging to bring to first PCP ___. 
Recommend L breast ultrasound and/or MRI as outpatient.
 
# Anxiety: Patient was understandably anxious given CP and 
breast symptoms. She was started on her home Buspar and also 
given standing Ativan while in hospital. She would likely 
benefit from outpt. therapy as well. SW saw pt. during admission 
as well.

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted to the hospital with chest pain that had been 
ongoing for months. After a careful review of your previous 
records, we decided to proceed with cardiac catheterization. We 
performed advanced diagnostics during the cath to determine if 
you would benefit from a stent being placed and it was felt that 
your symptoms would not improve with an intervention based on 
the diagnostics. Your graft was also functioning.

It is very important that you have close follow up for your 
breast pain. Your new PCP should be able to refer you to the 
___ here at your first visit. It would be very helpful 
if you could 

Medication Changes:
START Isosorbide Mononitrate Extended Release (Imdur) 30mg 
tablet once a day

You should continue to take all of your other medications as 
prescribed.

chest pain, diaphoresis, dyspnea, lightheadedness.

#  Chest pain - The patient's symptoms are somewhat consistent 
with angina, including the diaphoresis, dyspnea, radiation, and 
onset with exertion/emotional stress.  However, it did not 
resolve initially with nitroglycerin, and the pain continued 
throughout her hospitalization.  EKG was unchanged and troponins 
negative x 2 from the ED.

Upon review of records obtained from ___, these symptoms 
appear to be nearly identical to a number of previous admissions 
there which resulted in numerous negative stress tests and 
catheterizations.

Dipyridamole stress test was performed on ___ which was 
normal, but patient had non-progressive ___ atypical chest pain 
secondary to anxiety.  Nuclear scan showed normal perfusion and 
EF=46%.  Therefore worsening CAD was felt unlikely to be the 
cause of the patient's pain.

Patient has history of anxiety and depression, and history of 
abdominal pain (negative GI workup), transient blindness 
(negative workup), endometriosis.  Likely the patient's 
psychiatric issues contribute to this chest pain.  The patient 
should follow with her psychiatrist as an outpatient.  The 
patient also continues to smoke, and should be counseled for 
smoking cessation.  The patient's Plavix, isosorbide 
mononitrate, and metoprolol were continued during this 
admission.

# CAD/HLD - Patient is s/p stent and CABG.  LDL 110 in ___ 
which is not at goal < 100, ideally < 70.  Atorvastatin was 
increased from 60 to 80 mg po qday.

# Depression and anxiety - The patient did require some prn 
lorazepam during this admission secondary to anxiety regarding 
her chest pain.  She denied depressive symptoms.  She reported 
having an ongoing fight with her son, causing increased stress 
recently.  During this admission her sertraline, buspirone, 
bupropion, and lorazepam were continued.

and hyperlipidemia who was transferred from OSH for further 
management of CP concerning of UA. She developed acute onset 
substernal cp on ___ while sleeping, radiating to neck, and 
went to OSH were work up was notable for trops neg x3, ecg at

the afternoon of ___ to ___ for cath. On arrival to floor, 
she continued to promote chest pressure and was found to have 
new TWI in he precoridal leads on ecg. Given changes, decision 
made to bring her to cath lab immediately.  
In the Cath lab, angiography was notable for 60% ISR LAD stent 
with FFR 0.81. It was felt that any intervention on this would 
be higher risk than benefit and it was most likely not 
responsible for current chest pain. LIMA->LAD remains patent. 
Access was obtained via RFA angioseal with borderline high stick 
 
Following cath this evening, she is resting comfortably and is 
not experiencing any cp, sob, lh, or dizziness. She has mild 
discomfort at right groin site.

ESTIMATED blood loss:
Hemodynamics (see above):
Coronary angiography:  right dominant
LMCA: 
LAD:  60% proximal inside prior stent which has complex
aneurysmal appearance which is stable compared with prior cath 
of
___
LCX:  normal
RCA:  normal
LIMA to distal LAD is small but patent

Interventional details
Change for 6fJL4 guide.  Pressure wire of LAD showed FFR 0.81
which indicates no need for PCI.Angioseal right femoral artery.

 
Brief Hospital Course:
PRIMARY REASON FOR ADMISSION:
___ female with history of MI in ___ s/p stent placement at 
that time, followed by CABG ___ LIMA to LAD and hyperlipidemia 
who was transferred from OSH for further management of CP 
concerning of UA.  

ACTIVE ISSUES:
# Chest pain: The patient presented with her typical anginal 
chest pain concerning for unstable angina. At OSH, she had trops 
neg x3, ecg at baseline with no concerning st chanes, and normal 
CTA neck without evidence of infection. Given new TWI on arrival 
to the floor, she underwent cardiac catheterization that showed 
some non-flow limiting 60% re-stenosis of the LAD (FFR 0.81). It 
was unclear why she continues to have these episodes of anginal 
type chest pain although the patient does endorse significant 
life stressors. She was chest pain free throughout the remainder 
of her admission. She was continued on aspirin, metorprolol, 
imdur and atorvastatin and encouraged to stop smoking. Of note, 
she was continued on her home clopidogrel, although it is 
unclear whether she needs to be on this medication as it has 
been greater than ___ year since her prior catheterization.

# Weakness: Per ___ evaluation, the patient was weaker on the 
left side than described in her most recent neurology note. She 
was encouraged to see her outpatient Neurologist soon after 
discharge. She was also recommended to have outpatient physical 
therapy for her lower back pain.

CHRONIC ISSUES
#Anxiety: Stable. Continued with prn lorazepam
#Bronchitis: Finishing up a 10 day course of levofloxacin for 
bronchitis, last day to be ___.   
#Chronic pain: Stable. Continued with her outpatient 
oxycodone/oxycontin regimen  

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
- She may benefit from outpatient Neurology followup
- She was given a prescription for outpatient physical therapy
- Patient was admitted on clopidogrel and this was continued on 
discharge. The need for this medication should be discussed with 
her outpatient providers.
- She would benefit from continued encouragement to stop smoking
