Brief Hospital Course:
Psychiatric: Mr. ___ was admitted to the inpatient 
psychiatric service on Deaconess 4 on ___. At his initial 
meeting with care providers, he seemed anxious and irritable, 
and he was complaining of hearing voices, the description of 
which was vague and varied from interview to interview. The team 
restarted his outpatient wellbutrin, klonopin, and zyprexa. 
Small doses of haldol were added in the morning and afternoon. 
His abilify was tapered and ultimately discontinued. The team 
was concerned that his complaint of hearing voices just over the 
past few months was atypical. His story was corroborated by the 
woman he cares for, when social work spoke with her. 
Consideration was given to getting an MR brain with and without 
contrast to look for occult malignancy. However, a detailed 
neurological exam was completely normal, and his symptoms 
improved during the hospitalization. If the voices return or 
other atypical features are noted, we would recommend outpatient 
brain imaging. While admitted, he spent most of his time on the 
unit in his room, infrequently socializing with other patients. 
He did not attend any groups initially, but as his symptoms 
waned he began to attend psycho-education groups and participate 
productively in the discussion. By ___, the team felt that 
he was appropriate for discharge to his outpatient psychiatry 
appointment at ___. He was also scheduled to attend a partial 
hospitalization program starting one day after his discharge. At 
the time of discharge, he was no longer hearing any voices, and 
his mood had brightened somewhat. He did not endorse suicidal or 
homicidal ideation at any time during his admission. He 
continued to display a flat affect and limited ability to 
understand his psychiatric condition. He was not given any 
prescriptions at the time of discharge, because the team thought 
it would be optimal for all of his medications to be prescribed 
by the same provider. He was to bring a list of his hospital 
medications to his outpatient psychiatrist, and get presciptions 
for the needed medications at that time. She was faxed this 
discharge summary in advance of their appointment as well. 

Safety: He was maintained on q 15 minute checks throughout his 
admission, and he did not have any behavioral triggers.
