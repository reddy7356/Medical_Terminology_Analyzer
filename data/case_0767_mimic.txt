History of Present Illness:
___ with epilepsy, intellectual disability, hyponatremia,
hypothyroidism who presented to the ED from her group home after
having a seizure, on whom neurology has been consulted due to
concern for seizure.

History was obtained from ED dash as patient could not provide
history at time of evaluation.

Patient was sent in from group home after having a seizure. EMS
noted that patient may have had "possible tremors, with left eye
deviation concerning for seizure activity".  Reportedly AAO x3 
at
baseline, normally verbal able to follow commands. Patient was
given 2 mg of versed by EMS.  In the ED, patient reportedly had
left eye deviation, left arm and leg tremor, although was
intermittently responsive.  Per RN at bedside, she was able to
say her name one time, but no other verbal output and no
commands.  Patient then received 2 mg IV Ativan prior to getting
a central line (could not obtain PIV access).  I attempted to
call patient's group home at ___ for further information;
however no one answered.

Patient was admitted to neurology service from ___ to ___
when she presented with focal status epilepticus consisting of
left-sided facial twitching, left gaze deviation.  At that time,
the etiology of her seizure was thought to be subtherapeutic
phenytoin and acute on chronic hyponatremia with admission 
sodium
of 126 (or 128?).  During this admission, her phenytoin was
increased to 130 mg twice daily from 100/130.  Her salt tab
frequency was also increased to 1000 milligrams twice daily.  

From prior admission note, 
"Of note, Ms. ___ has intellectual disability, but is fairly
independent. She lives in a group home and goes to day program.
She is conversant. Toileting, dressing, eating independently. 
The meals are prepared for her, and she does not shop or handle
finances independently. All medications are administered by the
group home where she resides.

Seizure history:
Had first life-time seizure at age of ___, has infrequent
seizures, last one ___ years ago. In the past, her seizures have
been triggered by hyponatremia or trial of phenytoin wean. Her
epilepsy has been well controlled on valproic acid ___ BID and
phenytoin 100mg AM/130mg ___

ROS: Could not be obtained as patient cannot provide this
information and group home could not be reached

represent the sequelae of chronic microangiopathy.

CTH ___ - 
 
1. No acute intracranial abnormalities.
2. Chronic microvascular angiopathy and chronic infarcts in the 
frontal lobes
bilaterally.
 
Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ is a ___ year old woman with a history of
epilepsy (GTC on depakote and dilantin), intellectual 
disability,
chronic hyponatremia, hypothyroidism, who presented to the ED
from her group home where she had an episode concerning for
breakthrough seizure. She spiked a fever to 102 in the ED, and 
was started on broad spectrum meningitic coverage. An LP was 
done which was bland. She had a CTH with diffuse atrophy, no 
acute process. There was evidence of pneumonia on CXR, which was 
thought to be the most likely source of fever and thus her 
antibiotics were tapered to target community acquired pneumonia 
(as living in a group home setting is considered community 
acquired). This infection was thought to be the provoking 
etiology of seizure, as her AED levels were within normal limits 
and she had only mild hyponatremia in line with her previous 
ranges. While hospitalized, her pneumonia was treated with 
cefepime, which was transitioned to ceftriaxone, and she 
completed a 5 day course. She was found to be subtherapeutic on 
her AEDs (likely secondary to missed dose in the ED), which were 
reloaded, and her home doses were continued. She was evaluated 
by ___ who initially recommended rehab but on subsequent 
evaluation cleared her for home. Her home medications were 
continued. MRI brain was done to look for stroke as possible 
provoking etiology of seizure (and R NLFF on exam) however this 
was normal. Patient was at her neurological baseline at time of 
discharge and will follow up with her outpatient neurologist at 
___, which was discussed with her group home manager.

# Breakthrough Seizure
- EEG reassuring without any seizure activity
- MRI- B no evidence of acute findings
- continue home dose Depakote 500mg BID and phenytoin 130mg BID

# Community Acquired Pneumonia
- Cefepime and Vancomycin transitioned to Ceftriaxone completing 
a total of 6 days of antibiotics ___ levofloxacin 
due to seizures)

#Hyponatremia - chronic issue, reportedly due to SIADH
- Responded well to fluid restriction of 2L daily, slowly 
normalizing over 3 days. Recommend follow up with PCP, as 
hyponatremia should be avoided as it can precipitate seizure.

Transitional Issues
- follow up free Dilantin level (send out), still pending at 
discharge

Discharge Instructions:
Dear ___,

You were hospitalized due to symptoms of breakthrough seizure 
resulting from pneumonia, a condition where being sick makes you 
more likely to have seizures. While you were hospitalized, we 
did treated your pneumonia with antibiotics, and we gave you 
extra doses of your seizure medications, because when you first 
came in to the hospital, your levels were low, likely because of 
missed doses in the ED. We continued your other home 
medications. 

We are changing your medications as follows:
No medication changes

Please take your other medications as prescribed.

Please follow up with Neurology and your primary care physician 
as listed below.

If you experience any of the symptoms below, please seek 
emergency medical attention by calling Emergency Medical 
Services (dialing 911):
- Sudden partial or complete loss of vision
- Sudden loss of the ability to speak words from your mouth
- Sudden loss of the ability to understand others speaking to 
you
- Sudden weakness of one side of the body
- Sudden drooping of one side of the face
- Sudden loss of sensation of one side of the body

It was a pleasure taking care of you!

Sincerely,
Your ___ Neurology Team

DIAGNOSTICS:
==============
___, CTA H/N ___:
___ head CT: No acute large territorial infarction,
hemorrhage or mass. Prominence of the ventricles and sulci 
likely
represent involutional changes. Additional irregularity of the
left lateral ventricle is likely due to old frontal infarction
(series 2, image 23). Degenerative changes in the cervical 
spine,
most prominent at ___.
 
CTA head/neck:
Evaluation of the CTA head/neck is severely
limited by motion artifact. Within these limitations, there is 
no
obvious intracranial arterial occlusion, dissection, or 
aneurysm.
Intracranial vasculature appears grossly patent.

CXR:
IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ is a ___ F w/ known epilepsy (well controlled 
on valproic acid, and phenytoin), intellectual disability 
(living in group home), hyponatremia, hypothyroidism, who 
presented w/focal status epilepticus lasting about 20min. NCHCT 
and CTA H/N negative for acute changes, but notable for 
significant
atrophy and an old infarct.

She received 4 mg of Versed IM in the field. Not seizing on 
arrival to ___, but the subsequently began seizing with left 
sided facial twitching and gaze deviation to the left for an 
additional 5 minutes. She was given 2 mg of Ativan IV, and 
seizure stopped immediately. 

Etiologies of seizure could most likely subtherapeutic phenytoin 
at 8.3 and acute on chronic hyponatremia with admission sodium 
of 126. Depakote level on admission normal at 63. She was given 
5 mg/kg phenytoin load with post load level of 10.7. After this 
load, cvEEG was without further seizure. After discussion with 
outpatient neurologist, her phenytoin was increased to 130 mg 
BID from 100/130. Her ___ tab was increased to 1000 mg BID, 
previously 1000 mg daily. Sodium levels slowly increased over 
course of hospitalization to 135 at time of discharge.

She was evaluated by ___ and OT while in the hospital, and we 
feel she could benefit with continuing these services as an 
outpatient.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
========================

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,

You were hospitalized due to seizures. Your lab work showed that 
your sodium was too low. The level of one of your seizures 
medications, Dilantin, in your blood was also too low. These two 
things most likely lead to you have seizures.

Your daily sodium tabs were increased. We talked to your 
Neurologist and your Dilantin was also increased to 130 mg twice 
daily. You have been doing well on this regimen.

We noticed you were unsteady walking, and you were evaluated by 
___ and OT. We think you could benefit from their services as an 
outpatient.

Please follow up with your PCP and ___ as below. 

It was a pleasure taking care of you.

Sincerely,
Youre ___ Neurology Team
 
Followup Instructions:
