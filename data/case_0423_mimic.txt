Imaging:
Right FXR ___:
On the lateral view, soft tissue defect/ulceration is noted 
plantar to a 
proximal phalanx.  No definite acute cortical destruction is 
seen to suggest acute osteomyelitis radiographically, however, 
there is osteopenia of the second through fifth toes making 
assessment suboptimal.  Screws traverse the tibial talar joint.  
There are severe degenerative change at the tibiotalar joint.  
Degenerative changes are also seen on the dorsal aspect of the 
tarsal bones. 

Right lower extremity US ___:
No evidence of deep venous thrombosis ___ the right lower 
extremity veins.

TTE ___:
IMPRESSION: 
 1) Normal biventricular regional/global systolic function. 
 2) No echocardiographic evidence using TTE of endocarditis seen

R Ankle Films ___:
IMPRESSION:  
  
At the distal tibial syndesmosis, 1 of the 2 screws is broken.  
No acute 
fracture.  No definite focal erosion to suggest osteomyelitis 
radiographically.  MRI may be more sensitive for evaluation of 
early 
osteomyelitis 

R Foot MRI ___:
IMPRESSION: 

1. No convincing evidence of osteomyelitis. 
2. No rim enhancing fluid collection seen, please note imaging 
is suboptimal as the patient was moving throughout the study. 
3. Moderate degenerative changes at the first 
metatarsophalangeal joint with an associated joint effusion.  No 
adjacent bone marrow edema to suggest septic arthritis. 

CXR ___:
IMPRESSION:  
  
No prior chest radiographs available. 
  
Left PIC line ends ___ the low SVC.  Lungs clear.  Normal 
cardiomediastinal and hilar silhouettes and pleural surfaces. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
The patient presented to the emergency department on ___ and 
was evaluated by the podiatric surgery team. He was seen prior 
to arrival ___ clinic by Dr. ___. The patient was found to 
have right foot plantar abscess and was admitted to the 
podiatric surgery service. While ___ clinic, the abscess was 
incised and drained and a culture was taken. Additionally, there 
was a concern regarding his newfound swelling and pain to the 
right calf region while ___ clinic. ___ the emergency department 
on ___, a right lower extremity ultrasound was taken and did 
not show any signs of a DVT. Additionally, plain films were 
taken of the right foot and there was no definite acute cortical 
destruction seen to suggest acute osteomyelitis 
radiographically. 

While on the floor, the patient was started on IV ___ 
(vancomycin/unasyn). He was also noted to have a highly elevated 
CRP of 108.6. Blood cultures were also sent on ___ which showed 
positive growth for coag positive staph aureus. The infectious 
disease team was consulted and they recommended trending his 
CRP, obtaining an MRI of the R foot and obtaining a TTE. 

The patient had a TTE on ___ which did not show any signs of 
endocarditis or any other malformations. His CRP continued to 
decrease to 99.5 and the wound remained clean w/ no purulent 
drainage. The decision was made to not take the patient to the 
OR for a formal washout of the right foot wound. The patient 
complained of night sweats on ___ and thus an MRI of the right 
foot was ordered. The MRI showed no acute signs of osteomyelitis 
or deep abscesses. The patient also complained of right ankle 
pain and plain films were ordered. The films displayed an old 
right ankle ORIF fracture repair with one of the syndesmotic 
screws broken, however no radiographic findings consistent w/ 
osteomyelitis. At this point, ID recommended switching his 
antibiotics to 2g cefazolin q8hrs due to his sensitivities on 
gram stain and continuing his antibiotic therapy for 6 weeks due 
to positive blood cultures. The patient had a PICC line placed 
and the location was found to be appropriate for IV antibiotic 
therapy. He will continue to have IV antibiotic therapy at home 
and also have weekly labs drawn. 

At the time of discharge the patient's pain was well controlled 
with oral medications, the wound looked to be clean ___ 
appearance, and the patient was voiding/moving bowels 
spontaneously. The patient is WBAT ___ the right lower extremity 
___ a surgical shoe. The patient will follow up with Dr. ___ 
___ routine. A thorough discussion was had with the patient 
regarding the diagnosis and expected post-discharge course 
including reasons to call the office or return to the hospital, 
and all questions were answered. The patient was also given 
written instructions concerning precautionary instructions and 
the appropriate follow-up care. The patient expressed readiness 
for discharge.
