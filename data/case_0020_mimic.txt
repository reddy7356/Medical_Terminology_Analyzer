History of Present Illness:
Mr. ___ is ___ ___ student with prior

minds (e.g. "I can intuit what people are thinking. And then 
they'll laugh, and I know that I'm right").  When asked if 
medicine received in ED effected recent/current symptoms for 
which he came to the hospital, stated, "I think the medicine is 
great. It made me a little sleepy, but it's helping." Agreed to 
continue PO risperidone and lorazepam. Stated goal for 
admission, "I just want to get on a medication that kills the 
annoying, negative thoughts," citing recent ruminative thought 
content about perceived failure and inadequacies. Denied current

Brief Hospital Course:
1. LEGAL & SAFETY:  
On admission, the patient signed a conditional voluntary 
agreement (Section 10 & 11). On ___ patient signed a 
three-day notice, which was then retracted and re-signed on 
___. He was placed on 15 minute checks status on admission, 
which was increased to 5 minute checks due to concern for 
inappropriate remarks towards staff and other patients. Later 
patient was advanced again to 15 minute checks. He remained unit 
restricted throughout his admission.
.
2. PSYCHIATRIC:
Upon presentation to the unit, patient continued to describe 
symptoms of depression, stating that he had been feeling sad for 
some time. He also stated that he had been sleeping less though 
had not been getting tired. He also at that time endorsed 
suicidal ideation. Mental status exam at that time was notable 
for racing thoughts, disorganized thought process, grandiosity, 
magical thinking, and expansive affect.
.
Patient's presentation appeared most consistent with a manic 
episode as part of a bipolar disorder, possibly rapid cycling 
due to the abrupt onset of manic symptoms following his arrival 
to ___. Of note, the temporal relationship between his drug 
use (most notably cocaine) and his symptoms is not clear, though 
the persistence of his symptoms following discharge is more 
consistent with a primary mood disorder rather than a 
substance-induced affective episode. Unclear if previous 
.
Patient was initially started on risperidone and lorazepam, 
given concern for possible alcohol withdrawal. He was 
transitioned from risperidone to paliperidone for once-daily 
dosing to improve adherence; paliperidone titrated to discharge 
dose of 9mg QHS. Patient tolerated this medication and denied 
any medication side effects For additional mood stabilization, 
patient was started on divalproex ER 500 mg BID; trough prior to 
discharge was therapeutic at 79ug/mL
.
Over the course of patient's admission, he exhibited diminishing 
grandiosity and increasingly linear thought process. Patient 
consistently denied ongoing suicidal ideation. He also denied 
ongoing auditory hallucinations. Patient reported sleeping 
through the night and "enjoying life again." On discharge, 
patient described mood as "very good," and he demonstrated 
congruent, reactive, and full-range affect, a linear thought 
process, and no suicidal or homicidal ideation. He denied any 
auditory hallucinations. He briefly commented on several themes 
of paranoia, but then spontaneously stated that he did not 
really believe them. He demonstrated markedly improved insight 
and judgment at the end of his admission, self-identifying 
social supports to help him maintain stability following his 
discharge.
.
3. SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS:
#) Alcohol, Cocaine, and Nicotine Use Disorders: Patient 
received psychoeducation related to the connection between his 
symptoms and his drug use. Given his motivation to cut down on 
his drinking and drug use, patient was offered naltrexone; 
patient consented to starting. Although the patient did receive 
a nicotine patch during his inpatient stay, he declined the use 
of a patch as an outpatient. He is still precontemplative with 
respect to cutting down on his smoking.
.
4. MEDICAL
#) Glycosuria: patient noted to have isolated glycosuria on 
repeat urinalysis readings. Blood glucose and A1c noramal. No 
evidence of metabolic acidosis or phosphaturia indicative of a 
T2 RTA/Fanconi's syndrome. Per conversation with renal, nothing 
to do at this time; likely genetic disorder involved with 
proximal tubular handling of glucose. 
.
#) Chlamydia Trachomatis: Patient noted to have positive NAAT 
for CT on admission. NG negative. Denies any symptoms (e.g. 
penile discharge). Patient counselled on safe sexual practice,

sexual partern(s) to this infection, which he agreed to do. 
___ notified as per protocol.

noted to have mild transaminitis ALT>AST. Viral hepatatis labs 
reassuring, no evidence of hepB/hepC infection. Downtrending on 
repeat check.
.
5. PSYCHOSOCIAL
#) GROUPS/MILIEU:  
The patient was encouraged to participate in the various groups 
and milieu therapy opportunities offered by the unit. The

patients various coping skills. Throughout his stay patient was 
interactive in milieu and conversed frequently with staff and 
other patients.

others "being his enemies" and noted that patient had also 
markedly increased his cocaine use. Also stated that over this

up with his classes and had been increasingly isolative. In 
general, ___ expressed concern with respect to ___

medication and therapy provider, PCP, ___ meeting with 
school counselor.

psychoeducation related to drug use
.
INFORMED CONSENT: The team discussed the indications for, 
intended benefits of, and possible side effects and risks of 
starting Invega, Naltrexone, and Divalproex, and risks and 
benefits of possible alternatives, including not taking these 
medications, with this patient. We discussed the patient's right 
to decide whether to take these medications as well as the 
importance of the patient's actively participating in the 
treatment and discussing any questions about medications with 
the treatment team.  The patient appeared able to understand and 
consented to begin the medication. He was provided with 
additional information about these medications with handouts 
from ___.
.
RISK ASSESSMENT & PROGNOSIS
On presentation, the patient was evaluated and felt to be at an 
increased risk of harm to herself and/or others based upon 
suicidal ideation, manic symptoms, and drug/alcohol use. His 
static factors noted at that time included male gender and age. 
The modifiable risk factors were also addressed at that time: 
suicidal ideation without plan (provided appropriate 
pharmacotherapy, discussed crisis planning and reaching out to 
providers with patient), mania (initiated treatment with 
paliperidone and divalproex, limited outpatient treatment 
(provided with multiple outpatient providers), and active 
substance abuse (provided psychoeducation as well as started 
naltrexone).  Finally, the patient is being discharged with many 
protective risk factors, including a lack of suicidal ideation, 
no previous suicide attempts, help-seeking nature, 
future-oriented viewpoint, and overall life satisfaction. 
Overall, the patient is not at an acutely elevated risk of 
self-harm nor danger to others due to acutely decompensated 
psychiatric illness.
