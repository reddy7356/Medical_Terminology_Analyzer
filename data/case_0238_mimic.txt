___
CT CHEST W/CONTRAST; CT ABD & PELVIS WITH CONTRAST:
IMPRESSION:  
1. Fractures of the posterior and lateral right ___ ribs. 
2.  Left lower lobe consolidation may reflect atelectasis and/or 
aspiration. 

CT C-SPINE W/O CONTRAST  
IMPRESSION:  
Nondisplaced C6 spinous process fracture and left C7 transverse 
process/superior facet fracture. 

CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST:
IMPRESSION:  
1.  Left subdural hematoma causing 4 mm rightward shift of 
midline structures A more nodular component is seen, and an 
epidural hematoma cannot be excluded. 
2.  Small amount of left temporal subarachnoid hemorrhage. 
3.  Multiple facial, calvarial, and nasal bone fractures.  
Associated blood in the paranasal sinuses. 
4.  Large right frontal subgaleal hematoma. 
5.  Hypodensity along the left frontal and parietal lobes 
suggestive of prior infarct with possible wallerian 
degeneration. 

___
CHEST (PORTABLE AP):
IMPRESSION: 
1. Satisfactory position of endotracheal and enteric tubes. 
2. Multiple right-sided rib fractures without pneumothorax or 
pleural 
effusion. 3. Bilateral airspace opacification likely reflecting 
aspiration. 

CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST
IMPRESSION: 
1. No significant interval change in the size of the left 
subdural hematoma and associated 4 mm rightward shift of the 
midline structures. 
2. Stable left temporal subarachnoid hemorrhage. 
3. Interval increase in hemorrhagic opacification of the 
maxillary sinuses, sphenoid sinuses, and near complete 
opacification of the ethmoid air cells. 
4. Multiple fractures as previously described. 
5. Old tissue loss in the left temporal lobe.  White matter 
hypodensity of uncertain significance may be better assessed 
with comparison to old imaging studies or with MR. 

___:
ECG
Baseline artifact. Possible atrial fibrillation with a rapid 
ventricular 
response. ST-T wave changes laterally but could be consistent 
with ischemia. Clinical correlation is suggested. Compared to 
the previous tracing of ___ the presence of atrial 
fibrillation is new. Other findings are similar 

___:
VIDEO OROPHARYNGEAL SWALLOW:
IMPRESSION:  
Aspiration with nectar thick liquids. 

___:
CTA HEAD W&W/O C & RECONS:
IMPRESSION: 
1. Occlusion of the left internal carotid artery just distal to 
its 
bifurcation with short segments of irregular reconstitution in 
the cavernous and supra clinoid segments. 
2. Linear filling defect in the left vertebral artery at C5, 
which may be 
artifactual or may represent a focal dissection. 
3. Focal atherosclerotic calcifications in the right distal 
intradural 
vertebral artery, which may cause short-segment occlusion or 
severe stenosis. 
4. Interval evolution of the left cerebral convexity subdural 
hematoma with stable local mass effect and left-to-right midline 
shift.  No new hemorrhage. 
5. Unchanged fractures of the right nasal bones, right frontal

right zygoma, left C7 transverse process, and C6 spinous 
process. 
6. Acute to subacute appearing fractures of the right first 
through fourth ribs.

extremity. 
  

 
Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ was admitted to ___ 
after a fall down 20 stairs. He was found by family, positive 
for alcohol. He was brought in as a trauma to ___ and found to 
have a left subdural hematoma w/ 4 mm shift, left temporal 
subarachnoid hemorrhage, right posterolateral rib fractures ___, 
C6 spinous process fracture, C7 transverse process fracture, a R 
frontal subgaleal hematoma, and a variety of nonoperative facial 
fractures.  The patient was evaluated by Plastic and 
Neurosurgery upon arrival without any emergent operative 
intervention recommended, however, the patient was to remain on 
sinus and c-spine precautions with collar at all times, no 
logroll; scalp laceration sutured.  He was intubated at the 
scene and remained intubated and sedated in the intensive care 
unit.  On HD1, the patient had GPC in his sputum as was started 
on vancomycin and zosyn, which was transitioned to vancomycin 
and ceftriaxone and continued through HD4; antibiotics were 
adjusted to ciprofloxacin due a positive U/A.  He remained 
intubated until HD5 when he was successfully extubated; he had 
also been weaned from pressors and was requiring a 
antihypertensives. SLP performed an evaluation, however, the 
patient has signs of aspiration and was kept NPO.  He 
subsequently desaturated to the ___, had worsening pulmonary 
edema on CXR and was only intermittently responsive to 
intravenous furosemide, therefore, he required reintubation; at 
the time of reintubation, the patient became hypotensive, again 
requiring a levophed gtt.  Given events and leukocytosis, 
ciprofloxacin was discontinued and vancomycin/Zosyn was 
restarted to treat presumed aspiration PNA. The patient remained 
intubated as family declined PEG/trach ___ the patient's wishes 
and he made DNR.  On HD12, the patient was successfully 
extubated; seven day cefepime course completed and subsequent 
sputum cultures negative.  Tube feedings were continued at this 
time and the patient required free D5W and free water boluses 
due to hypernatremia.  SLP re-evaluated the patient and cleared 
him for honey thick liquids and pureed solids with 1:1 
monitoring.  

On HD14, given ongoing hemodynamic stability, the patient was 
transferred to the surgical ward.  He remained oriented to self 
with periods of confusion and agitation which self-resolved.  
Tube feedings were cycled and eventually discontinued as the 
patient tolerated a modified consistency diet; PICC was removed 
prior to discharge.  Of note, he did require replacement of a 
Foley as he was unable to void.  Physical therapy continued to 
treat patient and recommended rehab; please see page 3 for 
assessment.  The patient did report vision changes overnight on 
HD.  Neurology was consulted and the patient underwent a head 
CTA; Neurology recommendations included holding Plavix for one 
month total and outpatient follow-up. On HD20, the patient was 
discharged to rehab with the c-collar in place at all times.  He 
will follow-up with ophtamology, plastic surgery and neurospine 
as scheduled.
