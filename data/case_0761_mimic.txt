History of Present Illness:
Ms. ___ is a ___ year old woman with history of CABG, 
mechanical AVR and MVR, hx of severe PVD s/p PTA’s, being 
referred for both cardiac and RLE angiography on ___ 
___. She has a history of prior retroperitoneal bleed with 
last cath. She had had a long history of symtoms of claudication 
with ambulation. She has had ___ angiography in the past that has 
demonstrated several ___ blockages.
.
She states that at baseline, she can typically walk 
approximately one block before she has to rest. She stated that 
a few days ago, she had experienced some dull chest pain at rest 
that lasted a few minutes. It was not associated with any SOB, 
nausea, or diaphoresis.
.
On ___ patient taken for ___ and coronary angiography. Patient 
had a complicated procedure that led to her transfer to the CCU. 
During the cath, patient developed a LCFA dissection. The LCFA 
was ballooned using an approach from the right. Patient also was 
found to have a proximal RCA lesion that was stented using a 
BMS. She was also found to have a LMCA lesion that was not 
intervened upon. Several hours post intervention, patient 
complained of pain in LLE and was unable to move her foot. 
Patient's foot was cold and did not have any pulses. She was 
taken for re-look and was found to have an embolus in the 
popliteal artery. Patient had an embolectomy and a stent placed 
in the popliteal artery. She was started on a heparin gtt and 
was taken to the CCU for back pain, delirium, nausea. She 
recieved pain meds, lorazepam and now feels better. She dropped 
her oxygen satutations and her CXR showed possible pulm edema 
and got furosemide 10 mg IV x 1 at 12am, to which she has 
diuresed well.

COMMENTS:     
1. The right femoral artery sheath ws exchanged for a 6 ___ 
short
sheath. An omniflush catheter was advanced over an angled glide 
wire,
over the horn to the LCFA. Angiography revealed  a patent CFA 
with the
previous dissection site widely patent. The LSFA stent was 
widely patent
and the left popliteal artery was occluded and reconstituted 
aftet
approximately 40 mm. The AT and ___ were patent to the foot.
2. We planned to export the thrombus from the left popliteal 
artery and
laser if needed. A 6 ___ ___ sheath was advanced over the 
horn to
the contralateral SFA. The lesion was crossed with an angled 
glide wire
and then a spartacore wire. A 4.0 spider filter was used for 
distal
protection. Thrombectomy was preformed with the export cathether 
with
retrieval of thrombus but little improvment angiographically.
Atherectomy with a 1.4 mm laser at 45/30 was preformed without 
return of
flow. The lesion was then dilated with a 4.0 x 60 mm amphirion 
balloon.
A 5.0 x 80 mm Zilver stent was deployed in the left popliteal 
artery
and was post dilated with a 4.0 x 80 mm amphirion balloon.  
Final
angiography revealed no residual stenosis in the stent and no
dissection. The DP had a distal cut off though the ___ was widely 
patent.
3. Right femoral arteriotomy site was closed with a 6 ___ 
Angioseal
device.
 
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:    
1. Acute limb ischemia.
2. Successful thrombectomy, laser atherectomy, PTA and stenting 
of the
Left popliteal artery.

___ C Cath
COMMENTS:     
1.  Coronary angiography in this right-dominant system revealed:
--the LMCA had a proximal 70% tubular lesion with flow into the 
LCX and
competitive flow into the LAD.
--the LAD was patent with competitive flow to the diagonal and 
LAD from
a patent ___ graft.
--the LCX was a non-dominant vessel with moderate diffuse 
disease.
There is tenting of a small OM from the occluded SVG graft.
--the RCA was a dominant vessel with origin 90% lesion.
2.  Arterial conduit angiography revealed the LIMA-LAD graft to 
be
widely patent.  Venous conduit angiography revealed the SVG-RCA, 
SVG-OM,
and SVG-Diag grafts to be occluded.  This was confirmed by 
supravalvular
aortography.
3.  Supravalvular aortography confirmed occlusion of the 
SVG-RCA,
SVG-OM, and SVG-Diag grafts.
4.  Upon access in the ___ dissection was noted with preserved 
flow.
The EIA had moderate diffuse disease proximal to the previous 
SFA stent.
The REIA had a tubular 70% lesion with the RSFA having a 
proximal 90%
lesion above the previous stent.
5.  Limited resting hemodynamics revealed severe arterial 
systolic
hypertension, with SBP 202 mmHg.
6. We first palnned to fix the Right external iliac artery. We 
exchanged
the left CFA sheath for a 6 ___ Balken sheath. The lesion was 
crossed
with a  steel core wire to the Right popliteal artery. A 7.0 x 
80 mm
protege stent was deployed in the REIA and was post dilated with 
a 6.0 x
60 mm Admiral balloon. We then advanced a 6.0 x 20 mm 
angiosculpt
balloon to the proximal RSFA and dilated the lesion at moderate
pressure. Final angiography revealed no residual stenosis in the 
stent
and a 10% residual in the SFA.
7. We then turned our attention to the Right coronary artery. 
Successful
PTCA and stenting of the ostial RCA with a 4.0 x 15 mm VISION 
BMS which
was deployed at 17 ATM. Final angiography revealed no residual 
stenosis
in the stent, no dissection and TIMI III flow. (See ___ 
comments)
8. We then turned our attention to the LCFA dissection. We 
accessed t he
RCFA and placed a 6 ___ Balken sheath to the contralateral 
LCIA. A
angled glide wire was left in the L SFA. Angiography confirned a
retrograde dissection. The Left CFA was closed with a 6 ___ 
Mynx
device but flow diminished.  The ___ and the LCFA were t hen 
dilated
with a 6.0 x 60 admiral balloon to 5 ATMs. Final angiography 
revealed a
10% residual, a contained dissection with preserved flow.
 
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:    
1.  Native three-vessel CAD
2.  Patent LIMA-LAD
3.  Occluded SVG-RCA, SVG-Diag, and SVG-OM grafts.
4.  Dissection in ___ with preserved flow.
5.  Moderate diffuse disease in ___ tubular 70% stenosis in 
REIA and
90% stenosis in R SFA.
6.  Severe systemic arterial systolic hypertension.
7.  Successful stenting of the REIA and PTA of the RSFA.
8. Successful PTCA and stenting of the ostial RCA.
9. Successful PTA of teh LCFA dissection.
10.  Successful closure of ___ access site with Mynx closure 
device.

___ KUB
IMPRESSION: Incompletely visualized abdomen; however, visualized 
portion
appears normal. Indistinct left lung base, better characterized 
on
accompanying chest radiograph.

___ Femoral U/S
IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of hematoma, pseudoaneurysm or AV fistula.
2. No sonographic evidence of foreign object in the right common 
femoral
artery. A possible angioseal device is seen in the superficial 
tissues
superficial to the right CFA.

dissection, with REIA and L popliteal stenting.
.
#. CAD:  Patient is s/p CABG with triple vessel disease, and 
with lower extremity vascular disese.  CP free, but coronaries 
were looked. During the procedure, patient was found to have a 
tight left main that was supplying a diagonal (likely D1) that 
was not intervened upon.  The LMCA had a proximal 70% tubular 
lesion with flow into the LCX and competitive flow into the LAD 
that was patent.  The RCA was a dominant vessel with origin 90% 
lesion that was successfully stented with BMS.  The LMCA was not 
intervened upon.

#PVD: Stable. During the cath, patient developed a LCFA 
dissection. The LCFA was ballooned using an approach from the 
right.  Several hours post intervention, patient complained of 
pain in LLE and was unable to move her foot. Patient's foot was 
cold and did not have any pulses. She was taken for re-look and 
was found to have an embolus in the popliteal artery. Patient 
had an embolectomy and a stent placed in the popliteal artery.  
She was started on a heparin gtt and was taken to the CCU for 
back pain, delirium, nausea.  Patient recovered after one night
