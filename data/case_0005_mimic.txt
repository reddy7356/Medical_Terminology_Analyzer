STUDIES
CXR : FINDINGS:  No previous images.  The cardiac silhouette is 
within normal limits 
and there is no evidence of vascular congestion, pleural 
effusion, acute 
pneumonia, or pericardial effusion 

EKG:
New T wave inversions in inferior leads
No AV block

ECHO:
The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. The 
estimated right atrial pressure is ___ mmHg. Left ventricular 
wall thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic 
function are normal (LVEF >65%). Right ventricular chamber size 
and free wall motion are normal. The diameters of aorta at the 
sinus, ascending and arch levels are normal. The aortic valve 
leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet 
excursion and no aortic stenosis. Trace aortic regurgitation is 
seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is 
no mitral valve prolapse. Physiologic mitral regurgitation is 
seen (within normal limits). There is a trivial/physiologic 
pericardial effusion. 

IMPRESSION: Normal biventricular cavity sizes with preserved 
global and regional biventricular systolic function.

K-3.9 Cl-100 HCO3-25 AnGap-___ history of 2 weeks of abdominal pain, three tick bites, 
migratory arthropathies, headaches,new EKG changes and positive 
lyme serologies from OSH consistent with lyme disease
  
#ABDOMINAL PAIN: Likely Lyme myocarditis as per OSH report.   
Lyme serologies from osh being positive associated with 
migrating arthropathies, new EKG changes and headache all tie in 
with lyme disease and lyme myocarditis. Anaplasma and babesiosis 
testing were done in the OSH all of which were negative.  Daily 
EKGs were done which showed no AV block.  She did have T wave 
inversion in inferior leads but cardia bio-markers were 
negative.  An ECHO done showed no wall motion abnormalities. 
Given her EKG lacked classic features of Lyme carditis (e.g. AV 
block), her advanced age, and TWI concerning for ischemia, 
cardiology was consulted to evaluate the potential for ischemia. 
 Cardiology felt her findings were all consistent with lyme 
myocarditis and that patient did not require a stress ECHO to 
further work-up her EKG changes. Patient was managed with IV 
ceftriaxone and switched over to oral doxycycline at time of 
discharge.  She will continue her antibiotics for three weeks. 
She was managed with Ibuprofen 600mg TID for pain control.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
-please ensure completion of antibiotics for three weeks 
duration.
-please advise patient re:sun sensitivity with doxycycline
-please ensure rest and limited activity until pain subsides
-please ensure patient knows to report to PCP/ED if worsening 
chest pain

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms ___, 

It was a pleasure having you here at the ___ 
___.  You were admitted here with abdominal pain and 
found to have lyme pericarditis.  You were managed with IV 
ceftriaxone and were switched to oral doxycycline for a duration 
of 3 weeks. Please continue your antibiotics until ___. 
Please be aware that doxycycline can give you increased 
susceptibility to sun burn. Be sure to stay out of direct sun 
light, use plenty of sun block and wear long pants and sleeves 
for the duration of your treatment with doxycycline. Please keep 
your follow up appointments below.  You also had an ECHO ( 
ultrasound of the heart) which was normal.  The cardiology team 
assessed you and agreed with our treatment plan. Please ensure 
you do not exert yourself too much until you have completed 
treatment.  If you do have worsening chest pain after treatment, 
please report to your PCP or other doctor immediately.
 
Followup Instructions:
