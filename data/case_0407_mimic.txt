History of Present Illness:
___ male with history of EtOH abuse, HTN, anxiety, Stage 
IIA (ypT3, N0, cM0) pancreatic cancer s/p neoadjuvant 
FOLFIRINOX, chemoradiation followed by ___ with significant 
surgical complications presents from urgent care for 
hypotension.

Patient was receiving care at ___ previously. He first had 
abdominal symptoms in ___. EUS on ___ revealed dilated 
pancreatic duct and hypoechoic mass at head of pancreas, and 
cytology was suspicious for adenocarcinoma. He received C1 of 
FOLFIRINOX on ___. He has since finished 8 cycles of 
FOLFIRINOX, six weeks of chemoradiation with oral capecitabine, 
and Whipple procedure on ___. Since the procedure, he has 
been having recurrent ascites requiring monthly paracentesis. 
Please see outpatient oncology note for full details. 

Per report, patient fell on ___ night and was down on the 
ground until 8 AM on ___ morning. Per patient report, he 
kneeled down to look for something under the couch but had no 
strength to get himself up once he was on the ground. He denies 
falling; he had head shaking but did not lose consciousness and 
did not strike his head. He was instructed to present to urgent 
care, which he did on ___. At urgent care, he endorses pain all 
over, and he was found to have bandages on shins and arms. He 
was found to be hypotensive to 86/66, so he was transferred to 
___.

In ED initial VS were T 98.0, HR 73, BP 87/54, RR 18, and O2 98% 
RA. Exam was notable for normal neurologic exam, normal 
abdominal exam, and diffuse ecchymoses. Labs notable for WBC 
2.5, hgb 9.4, ALT 33, AST 58, Tbili 0.6, lipase 4, CK 388, Cr 
0.8, K 3.4, trop 0.04, INR 1.1, lactate 0.8. UA with 4 WBC, few 
bacteria, neg leuks, neg nitrites, and 0 epis. Utox positive for 
benzos but negative otherwise. 

In the ED, he then became febrile to 102.9 and hypotensive to 
81/54. He received 3L of fluid in the ED. He was given vanc, 
zosyn, and ceftriaxone in the ED. Due to persistent hypotension, 
he was started on levophed through the PICC.

EKG shows atrial fibrillation with ventricular rate 85, normal 
axis, no ischemic changes. 

CXR ___: 

Slight blunting the right costophrenic angle may be relate to 
hyperinflation versus a trace pleural effusion.  No large 
pleural effusion.  No focal consolidation seen.

unchanged from recent and remote prior.  No definite evidence of 
superimposed acute intra-abdominal process. 

2. Patient is status post Whipple procedure for adenocarcinoma 
of the pancreas with appropriate postsurgical changes.  However, 
there is increased soft tissue density involving the distal 
pancreatic body/tail which may represent disease recurrence.

K-3.8 Cl-105 HCO3-25 AnGap-___RIEF ICU COURSE ___ 
==========================
___ male with history of EtOH abuse, HTN, anxiety, Stage 
IIA (ypT3, N0, cM0) pancreatic cancer s/p neoadjuvant 
FOLFIRINOX, chemoradiation followed by Whipple with significant 
surgical complications, who presented with hypotension, fevers 
requiring levophed, now on vanc/zosyn.

# CLABSI:
# Septic shock: 
Patient presented after fall without loss of consciousness, per 
patient. Pt febrile and hypotensive in ED, BCx from ED positive 
for GNR in ___ bottles, likely from ___ line. CXR without 
evidence of consolidation; UA unremarkable; CT abd/pelvis 
without acute intraabdominal process. As per outpatient notes, 
he has had weekly dressing changes, but it is unclear if he 
performs appropriate line care otherwise. He required pressors 
in the FICU, but was weaned off and stable prior to call out to 
floor. He was continued on vanc/zosyn. 

He was seen by infectious disease who recommended an ultrasound 
a deep vein thrombosis in the site of his prior PICC line.  This 
did show a diffuse clot which was assumed to be the source of 
his polymicrobial bacteremia.  The PICC had already been 
discontinued but was thought to be the inciting event for the 
clot and a subsequent infection.  He was continued on Zosyn 
throughout his hospitalization and then transitioned to 
ertapenem at the time of discharge.  He will complete a 14 day 
course of IV antibiotics on ___ and then transition to 2 
weeks of ciprofloxacin to complete a four-week course.  He was 
afebrile throughout the remainder of his hospitalization after 
discharge from the intensive care unit.

# Pancreatic cancer: 
Stage IIa unresectable pancreatic cancer s/p neoadjuvant 
FOLFIRINOX, chemoradiation, and Whipple procedure. Per ___ 
clinic note, he appears to be disease free. Last CA ___ of 12 
on ___. However, imaging on admission raised some c/f 
disease recurrence, which will need to be assessed on MRI.  This 
was biopsied via endoscopic ultrasound on the day of discharge 
after it not possible to biopsy this by interventional radiology 
and CT-guided biopsy.  Pathology was pending at the time of 
discharge

# Deep vein thrombosis of the right upper extremity, PICC 
associated
He was found to have a DVT of his upper extremity on ultrasound 
on ___.  He was initially started on heparin given the plan for 
paracentesis the following day.  He was subsequently 
transitioned apixaban.  Anticoagulation was held for a day prior 
to his endoscopic ultrasound.  He was restarted on apixaban at 
the time of discharge.  We discussed in detail the choice 
between apixaban and 90 from a rivaroxaban and he opted for 
apixaban.  He was counseled extensively on the need to continue 
this medication for at least ___ months or until as directed by 
his oncologist.  He would likely benefit from lifelong 
anticoagulation prior history of atrial fibrillation.  He was 
deemed to be a poor Lovenox candidate as he has had trouble 
complying in the past with Coumadin.

# pancytopenia

His platelet counts on OSH records from ___ and ___ were 120 
and 147, respectively. This admission patient is more 
thrombocytopenic than his apparent baseline. Likely due to his 
congestive hepatopathy and hepatic vascular insufficiency ___ 
his Whipple procedure requiring weekly paracenteses. Also 
possible marrow suppression iso sepsis. Of note, per ___ 
records, patient has a history of being pancytopenic with a 
temporal correlation with ceftriaxone administration.  His 
platelets were slowly recovering throughout hospitalization and 
were 133 by the time of discharge.  In addition

In addition to thrombocytopenia, he also had anemia and 
ischemia.  These were all thought to be secondary to a 
combination of infection as well as his chronic liver disease 

# Fall: 
Patient reports fall at home prior to presentation and was 
laying down for several hours before being found by friend.  He 
felt extremely weak at the time likely in the setting of the 
bacteremia.  Denies LOC and head CT without evidence of bleed. 
Unclear cause of fall -- may be presyncope from arrhythmia vs 
valvular dysfunction, can also consider seizure. CK in 500s. TTE 
 showed EF of 55-60% with normal LV function.  He had no further 
episodes of falling position

 
# Atrial fibrillation: 
Patient is not compliant with home metoprolol or Coumadin. 
Admission INR 1.1. CHADsVASC of at least 2. Held metoprolol iso 
sepsis, and held AC pending further discussion. 

#Cirrhosis with evidence of liver dysfunction.
He has a prior history of liver dysfunction with refractory 
ascites likely due to his prior surgery for pancreatic cancer.  
His chronic diuretics were held for multiple days due to his 
hypotension restarted several days prior to discharge.  He did 
undergo an uncomplicated paracentesis on ___ with 3 L of 
fluid removed.  The fluid was negative for SP BP.  He received 
albumin as a result.  The final fluid culture pending at the 
time of discharge.  He will follow-up for repeat paracentesis 
with his prior physicians at ___ until he 
establishes care with a oncologist.

Transitional issues:
–Outpatient follow-up with surgery, hepatology, oncology
–Pancreatic cyst pathology still pending at the time of 
discharge
–Extensively counseled regarding anticoagulation and 
antibiotics.
–Set up with outpatient infusion clinic to complete his 
ertapenem given concern for his ability to deliver this at home 
as well as expense

Greater than 30 minutes spent on discharge counseling, 
communication and planning.
