Imaging:  
Chest radiograph (___): 
1. ET tube 6 cm above carina. 
2. Endogastric tube side port just at the GE junction, would 
recommend 
advancing approximately 5 more cm to ensure that it is within 
the stomach. 
3. Patchy opacities throughout the lungs may represent 
aspiration or 
hemorrhage in this patient with hemoptysis. 
4. Prominent right apical opacity may be prominent assymetic 
pleural 
thickening. Recommend correlation with history of malignancy and 
chest CT for further evaluation. 
.
Bronch report (___): large clot in RLL, actively oozing 
around clot.  Clot was not disturbed.  
.
TTE (___):
The left and right atria are moderately dilated. Left 
ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and global systolic 
function are normal (LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal technical 
quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully 
excluded. The right ventricular cavity is dilated. Free wall 
motion is low normal. The aortic valve leaflets are mildly 
thickened. There is no aortic valve stenosis. Mild (1+) aortic 
regurgitation is seen. Mild to moderate (___) mitral 
regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity 
of mitral regurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated.] 
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is moderate 
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial 
effusion. 
IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Normal biventricular 
cavity sizes with preserved global biventricular systolic 
function. Pulmonary artery hypertension. Moderaet mitral 
regurgitation. Mild aortic regurgitation. 
.
Rigid bronch report (___):
Once the patient was relaxed, the rigid bronchoscope was 
introduced into the oral cavity and followed along the double 
lumen endotracheal tube until the cords were visualized. At that 
point in time, the tracheal cuff on the double lumen was 
deflated and the tube was pulled back as the rigid scope 
intubated the cords and was positioned in the trachea. Once in 
good position, jet ventilation was started.

The flexible bronchoscope was then introduced through the rigid 
barrel and complete airway surveillance was done to subsegmental 
bronchi. Noted was a large amount of clot burden on the right 
side, but no active bleeding. The left side was clear and some 
minimal areas of secretions were all cleared
with the flexible scope. Large amounts of clot were removed from 
the all segments of the right lower lobe, including the 
posterior segment as well as the right middle lobe. There were 
no signs of active bleeding. No endobronchial lesion visualized. 
The flexible scope was then removed.

A Cook catheter was introduced through the rigid scope. The 
rigid was removed and a single lumen a tracheal tube introduced 
via direct visualization by Anesthesia. The tube was then 
confirmed to be approximately 2 cm above the carina via 
bronchoscopy. The bronchoscope was removed.  The procedure was 
ended with no complications.
 
Brief Hospital Course:
-please check CBC and CHEM 7 in 1 week to monitor for resolution 
of isolated thrombocytosis, check renal function, potassium 
after starting ACE-i
.
___ w/PMH significant for bronchiectasis, afib s/o ___ guided 
embolization for hemoptysis now called out from MICU for 
continued medical management of VAP; episode of chest pain 
during admission w/EKG changes, CEs negative x 3. 
.
MICU COURSE ___ - ___ Transferred to floor from ___ 
- ___
.
# Hemoptysis: Resolved s/p right bronchial artery embolization. 
Initially unclear etiology, with broad differential including 
bleeding in setting of bronchiectasis on dabigatran and 
overlying infection.  On admission to the MICU was s/p bronch 
demonstrating large clot in RLL with oozing.  Double lumen 
endotracheal tube was in place to protect the left lung from 
future bleeding and underwent emergent ___ bronchial artery 
embolization of right bronchial artery embolization using 
300-500 mic embospheres -> enlarged hypertrophic arteries 
suggestive of bleeding.  2 arteries supplying RLL, both 
embolized.  Subsequently the patient did well and was able to 
have a regular ETT placed. She had a repeat bronch showing no 
bleeding but copiuous secretions concerning for a VAP which was 
treated as below.  Her hematocrits remained stable and after 
consultation with her PCP it was decided that she would no 
longer be an anticoagulation candidate but could be restarted on 
asprin 325mg daily for stroke prevention in setting of AFib with 
recent TIAs. Pt was successfully extubated and weaned to home 
baseline O2 requirement of 2L prior to discharge without 
difficulty.
.
# Respiratory Failure/VAP. Intitially was intubated in the 
setting of hemoptysis however once bleeding resolved she 
continued to have RLL collapse on XRay concerning for another 
process. A bronch revealed no bleeding but copious secretions 
concerning for VAP. She was treated with Vanc and Zosyn until 
sputum and BAL cultures grew out two strains GNRS and 
antibiotics were broadened to Tobramycin. When speciation and 
sensitivities grew out two strains of pseudomonas antibiotics 
were weaned to Zosyn.  ID was consulted who recommended 
completing a 15 day course of zosyn (day ___ to ___. She 
had a difficult time weaning from the vent and diuresis was 
initiated in the hope of improving her respiratory status.  She 
was successfully extubated on ___ and weaned to baseline O2 
requirement without issues.
.
# Atrial fibrillation: Developed secondary to ASD surgical 
repair.  Patient with history of cerebral bleed on coumadin and 
TIA without anticoagulation. Anticoagulation was held in the 
setting of hemoptysis and as above after consultation with her 
PCP she was restarted only on Aspirin 325mg daily for CVA ppx.  
Her home rate controlling agents were initially held in the 
setting of her bleed and slowly added back (metoprolol, 
diltiazem, and digoxin). Had episodes of afib with RVR in ICU, 
now resolved. Metoprolol titrated up to 150mg daily for improved 
rate control. Patient was on short acting diltizem four times a 
day as an inpatient; this was switched to long acting diltiazem 
on discharge.
.
# Diarrhea: In setting of tube feeds via NGT while patient was 
being cleared by speech and swallow. Resolved after stopping 
tube feed. Denied abdominal pain, N/V, remained afebrile; C. 
diff negative x 2 and no leukocytosis. 
.
# Chest pain: 30 minute episode of L sided chest pressure ___ 
days prior to discharge, resolved with SLNG x 1, dynamic EKG 
changes notable for ST depressions in lateral leads, resolved 
when chest pain free. CE negative x 3. Echo performed earlier 
this admission w/dilated atria, intact systolic function. 
Maximized medical management by uptitrating beta blockage, 
continuing ASA, and starting statin, ACE-i. Patient was on 
atorvastatin 80mg as an inpatient, but switched to simvastatin 
40mg on discharge in light of LDL of 119, lisinopril 5mg for 
improved BP control, cardiac/renal protection.
.
# Thrombocytosis: Isolated thrombocytosis without elevated WBC, 
fevers or other signs or symptoms of infection. Started to trend 
downward prior to discharge. 
.
# Bronchiectasis: Patient with baseline O2sats in the low ___ on 
2L. She was continued on home nebulizers.
.
# GERD: continued on PPI.
.
# HTN: Held home antihypertensives initially in setting of 
bleed.  Metoprolol and diltiazem were later restarted. 
Metoprolol increased as above, started lisinopril 5mg daily.
.
# Hyponatremia: Chronic per outside records, attributed to 
SIADH.  Sodium within known range, improved with 250cc NS bolus, 
free water restriction to 1L/day.  Home demeclocycline briefly 
held in ICU, but then continued. Na 136 on discharge.
.
# Prophylaxis: Patient received heparin products during this 
admission.
.
# Code: Full
