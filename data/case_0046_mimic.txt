#SBO
Pt p/w SBO based on symptoms and xray evidence. she was treated 
with conservative management by NPO, IVF, pain control, nausea 
control. Her nausea and abdominal pain worsened, so a 
nasogastric tube was placed which provided some symptomatic 
relief. She was unable to tolerate clears despite NGT placement 
so she underwent a therapeutic paracentesis of 3L ascites fluid, 
whic provided significant relief of abdominal pain. Her nausea 
also improved and she was able to tolerate clears without 
symptoms. She had large bowel movements shortly after which also 
provdied relief. The following day, she was advanced to regular 
food and tolerated it well initially, but her nausea and emesis 
returned the following day. She was returned to clear diet and 
monitored over two nights. Her symptoms abated while remaining 
on clears and she was discharged home in stable condition with 
instructions to advance her diet very slowly at home. Pt was 
agreeable with this plan and had close followup on discharge.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,

It was our pleasure caring for you at ___ 
___.  You were admitted to the hospital for nausea 
and vomiting, which was most likely due to a small bowel 
obstruction (SBO).  This was most likely caused by your cancer.  
We performed a procedure called a paracentesis to drain fluid 
that had accumulated in your belly and placed a nasogastric (NG) 
tube through your nose into your stomach, and your symptoms 
improved.  When you were no longer vomiting, we advanced your 
diet, and you were able to tolerate regular foods without 
difficulty.  We removed the NG tube and you were discharged 
home.  Please remember to eat a diet that is high in fiber and 
to take a daily stool softener (e.g. Colace) in order to prevent 
constipation.

Thank you for allowing us to participate in your care.

admission, pt was managed conservatively and underwent 
paracentesis to remove 3L ascites fluid after she was slow to 
improve. She was able to tolerate a clear diet without n/v/pain 
and was ultimately discharged on clear diet with instructions to 
advance very slowly at home. During the evening of her discharge 
at home, however, she tried some broth, jello, and cranberry 
juice for dinner and had recurrence of nausea with emesis during 
the night. She tried broth and gatorade the next day and felt 
okay during the day until nausea and vomiting recurred during 
the night. She denies any fever, chills, abdominal pain, chest 
pain, sob. She has had one BM consisting of small pieces of 
stool and fluid at home. She endorses a lot more burping than 
passing flatus. Her friend brought her back to clinic today out 
of concern and she was directly admitted to OMED to obtain CT 
imaging given persistence of her symptoms.

# Small bowel obstruction: 
Pt's persistent SBO was likely due to a large loculated 
mesenteric fluid collection (~25 cm) compressing her small bowel 
that was identified on CT A/P on ___. This fluid collection had 
been enlarged in comparison to that previously seen on CT in 
___. Pt was initially managed conservatively on admssion with 
NPO and IVF with symptomatic medications. Her nausea and 
vomiting had resolved by admission and htere was no acute need 
for NGT placement. ___ was consultation for drainage of the 
loculated fluid collection. Per discussions held with pt's 
primary oncologist, ___ was asked to place a Pleurex abdominal 
drain, given the high likelihood of re-accumulation and 
recurrent SBO. The purpose of the drain was palliative, and pt 
was instructed on management and drainage of fluid at home upon

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,

It was a pleasure caring for you at ___ 
___.  You were admitted to the hospital for nausea 
and vomiting.  We did a CT scan of your belly and found a large 
collection of fluid that was compressing your intestines and 
causing an obstruction.  Our interventional radiologists 
inserted a permanent catheter (called a "Pleurex" catheter) into 
this fluid collection to drain it and relieve the obstruction.  
After draining the fluid collection, your obstruction improved, 
and you began having bowel movements and were able to tolerate 
drinking liquids again.  You should continue to advance your 
diet slowly over the next several days.  

If you feel nauseated or have abdominal distension, you should 
drain your pleurex catheter.  You don't have to do this on any 
particular schedule; you should do it only as needed for 
abdominal distension.

Finally, prior to discharge, we started a new chemotherapy 
medicine called Abraxane, which you tolerated well.  You will 
follow-up with your primary oncologist, Dr. ___ 
future doses of this medication.

Thank you for allowing us to participate in your care.

STUDIES
======================================
___ CXR
FINDINGS:  The heart appears mildly enlarged.  The cardiac, 
mediastinal and hilar contours appear stable.  There is similar 
mild relative elevation of the right hemidiaphragm.  There is no 
pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The right lung remains clear. 
 There is a medial retrocardiac opacity probably in the left 
lower lobe, better visualized on the two AP views compared to 
the lateral, not present before. 
IMPRESSION:  Patchy retrocardiac opacity, probably pneumonia. 

___ BRAIN MRI
FINDINGS:  
There is no intracranial hemorrhage. Diffusion weighting imaging 
does not 
demonstrate evidence of acute infarct. There are small scattered 
T2/FLAIR high signal foci throughout the bihemispheric white 
matter which are nonspecific but may be sequela of chronic 
microvascular changes.  Right cerebellar lacune is noted. Gray 
white matter differentiation is otherwise maintained. Ventricles 
and extra axial spaces are within normal limits for age. The 
major intracranial vessels exhibit the expected signal void 
related to vascular flow.  No abnormal enhancement is 
appreciated. 
The paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells demonstrate normal 
signal.  The sella turcica, craniocervical junction, and orbits 
are unremarkable. 
IMPRESSION:  
Age-related involutional and probable chronic microangiopathic 
changes without evidence of acute infarct, hemorrhage, mass or 
mass effect, or abnormal enhancement appreciated. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ year old female with history of stage IV endometroid type 
endometrial cancer on Gemzar, recently discharged for LLE 
cellulitis, represented to the ED with ongoing fevers, found to 
have ongoing cellulitis as well as possible new pneumonia.  
 
Active issues:  
# Fever/cellulitis: Most likely source of fever is her ongoing 
active cellulitis. She also had a retrocardiac opacity on CXR 
suspicious for pneumonia, although the patient denied any upper 
respiratory symptoms of productive cough or shortness of breath. 
UA is unremarkable. During prior hospitalization, patient was 
felt have chronic venous stasis changes bilaterally with 
overlying cellulitis of the LLE only (BLE cellulitis would be 
highly unlikely). Patient had no evidence of DVT per LENIs. As 
patient was not neutropenic patient was transitioned from 
vanc/cefepime to levofloxacin for treatment of both cellulitis 
and potential PNA. She continued to improve on levofloxacin and 
did not develop any further fevers. Patient was discharged to 
complete a course of levofloxacin at home.

# Metastatic Endometrial cancer: stage IV- first chemotherapy  
___. disease also throughout abdominal cavity and in the 
rectus muscle on PET-CT. Last chemo was ___.  Patient has 
had issues with her gait so her outpatient oncologist had 
planned for an MRI.  This was completed while in-house.  MRI 
head showed no evidence of metastatic disease.

Chronic Issues:  
# Diabetes: complicated by neuropathy.  Continued on home 
metformin at discharge.
 
# Hypertension: Patient had borderline low blood pressures while 
in-house during her last hospitalization so her home verapamil 
was decreased from 360 mg daily to 240 mg daily. She continued 
to have lower range blood pressures so her verapamil was 
discontinued; she continued to be normotensive without her 
verapamil. She was also previously taking 80 mg daily of Lasix, 
but switched to every other day dosing as the patient reported 
that times she felt orthostatic at her home dose.  
 
# CAD: Stable. Continued daily aspirin 81 mg. 

# Depression: Stable.  Continued home amitriptyline.

***TRANSITIONAL ISSUES***
- Patient to have port placement as an outpatient.
- Patient will need a blood pressure check with PCP as home 
verapamil discontinued.

Dear Ms. ___, 

You were admitted to the hospital because you had a fever.  The 
possible causes of this fever include an infection under the 
skin of your leg (called cellulitis) or a pneumonia which we saw 
a little bit of evidence for on your chest xray.  You were given 
an antibiotic which will treat both pneumonia and cellulitis, 
and you stopped having fevers.  

It was a pleasure taking care of you in the hospital!
