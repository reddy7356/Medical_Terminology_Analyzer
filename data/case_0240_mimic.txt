Brief Hospital Course:
___ yo female with multiple sclerosis on Tysabri, 
nephrolithiasis, presents with vague abdominal symptoms, low 
grade fever, and abnormal LFTs, now with presumed 
choledocholithiasis with obstruction s/p ERCP with sludge 
removal, sphincterotomy.

# Choledocholithiasis with obstruction- suspect this was the 
primary etiology of her symptoms over the past week, less likely 
biliary colic. Appreciate ERCP input, per their recs, will give 
short course of cipro x 5 days. LFTs are improving, suspect 
obstrucion is the primary cause. Hepatitis serologies show 
hepatitis B immunity and no evidence of hepatitis A or C. Will 
have patient recheck her LFTs in one week with her PCP to ensure 
normalization. If remains elevated, will need additional 
evaluation as an outpatient.

# Cholelithiasis- will need consideration for cholecystectomy in 
the future vs. expectant management, as she may be symptomatic 
from biliary colic as well; defer to patient/PCP.

# History of nephrolithiasis- renal function is normal, no 
evidence of retained stone or hydronephrosis on imaging, and not 
infected, so will monitor for now

# Multiple sclerosis- Will continue home gabapentin, Provigil, 
pramipexole. She cannot receive Tysabri as previously scheduled 
on day of discharge given hepatic dysfunction, but hopefully her 
LFTs will improve after ERCP with stone removal and 
sphincterotomy, and she can resume Tysabri in the near future. 
I've sent a note to her neurologist to update her.

# GERD- cont PPI

# FEN- as above
# Ppx- SC heparin
# Code- full
# Contact- patient, parents are HCPs (needs to complete HCP 
form)

ECG: Sinus rhythm. Normal tracing. Compared to the previous 
tracing of ___
T waves appear more normal on the current tracing.

CTU final read: IMPRESSION: Decreased perfusion of the upper 
pole of the left kidney, mild dilation of the left proximal 
urter and thickening of and stranding abou the left proximal 
ureter. Findings are most suggestive of infection; however, 
differntial considerations also include infarct or infectious 
process.
Repeat CTU after treatment is recommended for further 
evaluation. If the
ureteral abnormality persists, a retrograde ureteral study 
should be
considered to exclude malignancy.
 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ female with a history of MS presenting with acute onset, 
severe left flank pain.  CT scan with wedge-shaped defect 
consistent with infection or infarction.
.
# Left flank pain: Radiology read had differential of infarct vs 
infection, more likely infection.  However, her acute onset of 
pain without preceding fevers, dysuria or other symptoms was 
more concerning for acute ischemia, likely from a clot.  She had 
no obvious source for a clot, with a negative Echo bubble study 
and no signs of afib on history or telemetry.  She had recently 
flown from ___, but with a stop in ___, likely not long 
enough for a venous clot.  Her pain was managed with standing 
Tylenol and PO morphine while inpatient, and she was discharged 
with Tylenol and oxycodone.  Her laboratory results were 
consistently normal and she did not have any signs of compromise 
of her renal function, despite the seemingly large size of the 
infarct on CT scan.
Revised read by radiology showed signs of a possible stone at 
the UV junction which could explain the distal hydronephrosis 
and perinephric stranding.  They did not feel that an MRI would 
be more helpful than the CT scan.  Radiology and urology 
recommended treatment and repeat imaging in 2 weeks. She 
received 4 days of ciprofloxacin and is being empirically 
treated with BID lovenox with a plan of repeat CT urogram with 
and without contrast in 2 weeks prior to an appointment with her 
PCP, ___, to decide on management.  Given that her 
history and CT scan were consistent with an arterial clot, she 
will also follow-up in ___ clinic to consider 
whether long-term anticoagulation would be necessary to prevent 
recurrent clots.  If her repeat CT scan is abnormal, she should 
also see a urologist.  She was discharged on lovenox as the 
anticipated course of anticoagulation will be relatively short, 
and she is of child-bearing age.

Dear Ms ___,

You were admitted to the hospital with acute cholecystitis. You 
were taken to the operating room and had your gallbladder 
removed laparoscopically. You tolerated the procedure well and 
are now being discharged home to continue your recovery with the 
following instructions.
 
Please follow up in the Acute Care Surgery clinic at the 
appointment listed below.
 
ACTIVITY:
 
o Do not drive until you have stopped taking pain medicine and 
feel you could respond in an emergency.
o You may climb stairs. 
o  You may go outside, but avoid traveling long distances until 
you see your surgeon at your next visit.
o  Don't lift more than ___ lbs for 4 weeks. (This is about 
the weight of a briefcase or a bag of groceries.) This applies 
to lifting children, but they may sit on your lap.
o You may start some light exercise when you feel comfortable.
o You will need to stay out of bathtubs or swimming pools for a 
time while your incision is healing. Ask your doctor when you 
can resume tub baths or swimming.
 
HOW YOU MAY FEEL: 
o  You may feel weak or "washed out" for a couple of weeks. You 
might want to nap often. Simple tasks may exhaust you.
o  You may have a sore throat because of a tube that was in your 
throat during surgery.
o  You might have trouble concentrating or difficulty sleeping. 
You might feel somewhat depressed.
o  You could have a poor appetite for a while. Food may seem 
unappealing.
o  All of these feelings and reactions are normal and should go 
away in a short time.  If they do not, tell your surgeon.
 
YOUR INCISION:
o Tomorrow you may shower and remove the gauzes over your 
incisions. Under these dressing you have small plastic bandages 
called steri-strips. Do not remove steri-strips for 2 weeks. 
(These are the thin paper strips that might be on your 
incision.) But if they fall off before that that's okay).
o Your incisions may be slightly red around the stitches. This 
is normal.
o You may gently wash away dried material around your incision.
o Avoid direct sun exposure to the incision area.
o Do not use any ointments on the incision unless you were told 
otherwise.
o You may see a small amount of clear or light red fluid 
staining your dressing or clothes. If the staining is severe, 
please call your surgeon.
o You may shower. As noted above, ask your doctor when you may 
resume tub baths or swimming.
 
YOUR BOWELS:
o Constipation is a common side effect of narcotic pain 
medications. If needed, you may take a stool softener (such as 
Colace, one capsule) or gentle laxative (such as milk of 
magnesia, 1 tbs) twice a day. You can get both of these 
medicines without a prescription.
o If you go 48 hours without a bowel movement, or have pain 
moving the bowels, call your surgeon. 
 
PAIN MANAGEMENT:
o It is normal to feel some discomfort/pain following abdominal 
surgery. This pain is often described as "soreness". 
o Your pain should get better day by day. If you find the pain 
is getting worse instead of better, please contact your surgeon.
o You will receive a prescription for pain medicine to take by 
mouth. It is important to take this medicine as directed. o Do 
not take it more frequently than prescribed. Do not take more 
medicine at one time than prescribed.
o Your pain medicine will work better if you take it before your 
pain gets too severe.
o Talk with your surgeon about how long you will need to take 
prescription pain medicine. Please don't take any other pain 
medicine, including non-prescription pain medicine, unless your 
surgeon has said its okay.
o If you are experiencing no pain, it is okay to skip a dose of 
pain medicine.
o Remember to use your "cough pillow" for splinting when you 
cough or when you are doing your deep breathing exercises.
If you experience any of the following, please contact your 
surgeon:
- sharp pain or any severe pain that lasts several hours
- pain that is getting worse over time
- pain accompanied by fever of more than 101
- a drastic change in nature or quality of your pain
 
MEDICATIONS:
Take all the medicines you were on before the operation just as 
you did before, unless you have been told differently.
If you have any questions about what medicine to take or not to 
take, please call your surgeon.
