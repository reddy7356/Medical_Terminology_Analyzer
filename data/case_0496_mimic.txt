History of Present Illness:
Ms. ___ is a ___ year old woman with no significant past 
medical history who had onset of non-radiating low back pain 
after shoveling 2 weeks ago. She developed a low-grade fever 
last week and then developed bilateral anterior
thigh pain and weakness the day before presentation. She 
originally presented to ___ and was found to have a 
urinary tract infection and left lower lobe pneumonia. A chest 
CT demonstrated severe lumbar stenosis and a neurogenic bladder 
and she was transferred to ___ for further management. Given 
her severe lower extremity weakness on exam ___ association with 
urinary retention, an MRI of her entire spine was performed 
which was significant for a T11-L2 epidural abscess. She was 
taken to the OR emergently for T11-L2 laminectomy. The 
infectious disease service was consulted and were concerned for 
possible endocarditis. A transesophageal echocardiogram revealed 
a large vegetation on mitral valve. The cardiac surgery service 
was consulted for mitral valve replacement.

cultures
         positive for Staphylococcus aureus, yeast or other 
fungi. 
         Staphylococcus species may develop resistance during 
prolonged
         therapy with quinolones.   Therefore, isolates that are 
initially
         susceptible may become resistant within three to four 
days after
         initiation of therapy.  Testing of repeat isolates may 
be
         warranted.

Brief Hospital Course:
She was taken to the operating room on ___ and underwent 
debridement of left ventricular vegetation. Please see operative 
note for full details. She tolerated the procedure well and was 
transferred to the CVICU ___ stable condition for recovery and 
invasive monitoring. Due to the complexity of her 
hospitalization, the remainder of this summary will be divided 
by systems.

Neuro:
On the morning of ___ she was noted to be more confused by 
her nurse. Neurology was consulted and upon their evaluation 
there was no speech production, she was inconsistently following 
commands, she had left gaze preference, plegic left arm, 
decreased movement of the left leg compared to the right. 
However, over a period of 30 minutes, her exam greatly improved 
to the point where she was somewhat somnolent but was producing 
understandable speech, following commands consistently, had 
normal extraocular movements, improved weakness of the left arm 
with good antigravity effort, and improvement ___ the left leg as 
well. Given the rapid resolution of her symptoms it was thought 
to be small embolic strokes versus TIA. Spine and brain MRI was 
recommended to rule out spinal cord septic embolism. The studies 
were significant for small punctate ischemic infarcts, primarily 
right frontal cortex. No
evidence of hemorrhage, abscess, or parenchymal inflammation 
(cerebritis). CTA without evidence of mycotic aneurysm. 

Postoperatively she intermittently followed commands and 
remained intubated and sedated. Repeat brain imaging was 
significant for a trace subarachnoid hemorrhage overlying the 
frontal lobe. Neurosurgery was consulted and cerebral angiogram 
was recommended. The study revealed no evidence of infectious 
aneurysm or other vascular lesion to explain the hemorrhage. No 
further evaluation or intervention was recommended. She weaned 
from sedation and was awake and alert on ___. A ___ and 
neck CTA on ___ demonstrated no evidence of mycotic 
aneurysm. 

Resp:
She remained intubated until postoperative day ___ and has 
since weaned to room air.  Her most recent chest imaging shows 
stable bilateral pleural effusions and multiple bilateral 
cavitated lung nodules. 
 

Cardiac:
She was weaned from inotropic and vasopressor support. Beta 
blocker was initiated and she was diuresed toward her 
preoperative weight. She remained hemodynamically stable and was 
transferred to the telemetry floor for further recovery.  

GI:
A preoperative right upper quadrant ultrasound on ___ 
revealed normal liver, gallbladder sludge, splenic infarct, and 
pancreatic cysts. Tube feeds were initiated to maintain 
nutrition during prolonged intubation. She will need outpatient 
follow up with MRI imaging for management of pancreatic cysts.  
She has had loose stools with negative CDiff check, and these 
are felt to be due to tube feeds and magnesium supplementation.

Renal:
She developed hypernatremia which improved with Kphos ___ D5W.  
She is receiving free water flushes with her tube feeds.

Heme:
She was transfused blood products for acute blood loss anemia.

ID:
She presented with epidural abscess, splenic abscess, and psoas 
abscess. Cultures were positive for MSSA and she was started on 
Nafcillin which will continue until ___. Psoas abscess was 
managed with CT guided drainage of the collection. ACS continued 
to follow Mrs. ___ for her splenic abscess. CT of the 
abdomen and pelvis on ___ demonstrated multiple large 
wedge-shaped regions of 
hypoattenuation ___ the spleen, not appreciably changed compared 
to prior. There is no rim enhancement to suggest abscess 
formation.  Her foley catheter was replaced for urinary 
retention on ___ and she was empricially started on 7day 
course Ciprofloxacin for positive urinalysis (Culture & 
sensitivity pending).

Access:
Left subclavian PICC line was placed on ___. 
She is taking POs with supplemental nutrition via tube feeds. 

  
She was evaluated by the occupational and physical therapy 
services for assistance with strength and mobility. By the time 
of discharge on post-op days 22, 20 and 18 she was 
deconditioned, the wound was healing, and pain was controlled 
with oral analgesics. She was discharged to ___ ___ 
___ ___ good condition with appropriate follow up 
instructions.
