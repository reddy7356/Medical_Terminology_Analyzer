Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ was transferred to the ___ 
ED after being found down outside with loss of motor and 
sensation to her lower extremities.  MRI showed unstable C3-C7 
fractures with canal disruption and spinal cord injury.  She was 
hypothermic, hypotensive and bradycardic; she was admitted to 
the TSICU in acute spinal shock and transferred to Neuro ICU 
Post op. 

#Neuro
The patient was admitted to the TSICU in acute spinal shock.  
Cervical collar remained in place; she was maintained on 
norepinephrine drip to maintain MAP>70 for cord perfusion, which 
was transitioned to phenylephrine (see Cardiac section). MAP 
goal was relaxed on HD 2. Surgical fusion was discussed with the 
patient and family and she was placed on the OR schedule for 2 
stage posterior and anterior fusions. Family meeting was held on 
HD 3 all questions answered. On ___, she underwent anterior C7 
corpectomy and C4-T1 fusion, and stage II posterior fusion C4-T1 
with Dr. ___. Procedure was uncomplicated and she was 
transferred intubated to the ICU postop. She remained in hard 
collar at all times postoperatively. On ___, staples were 
removed. The incision appeared well healed. On ___, cervical 
collar was removed, may be worn for comfort as needed.   She 
will follow up in the office in 1 month with Cervical Spine CT

#Respiratory
The patient maintained her airway pre-op and did not require 
intubation. On ___, the chest x-ray and CTA revealed bilateral 
pleural effusions, left greater than right as well as an 
aspiration PNA. The CTA was negative for PE. She underwent 
bilateral lower extremity Doppler studies which were negative 
for DVT. She was started on a course of Cefepime and Vancomycin 
for treatment of the PNA. Chest x-ray on ___ which showed a 
worsening left pleural effusion. On ___, the pleural effusion 
was tapped for 500cc. On ___ in ___ the patient was turned to 
left side and had immediate desaturation to 90 and SBP to ___, 
returned to baseline when off left side. On ___, she was placed 
on Lasix drip for reaccumulation of left pleural effusion.  The 
patients daughter agreed to trach placement. Tracheostomy was 
placed by ACS on ___. On ___, the patient became tachypneic. 
CXR showed worsening of 
bilateral pleural effusions. She underwent bilateral placement 
of pigtail catheters. On ___, catheters were removed. Trach was 
placed ___ and she is intermittently able to be weaned to trach 
collar.  She was evaluated by SLP for speaking valve ___, but 
he was unable to exhale, appeared anxious and becomes 
bradycardic, so SLP re-eval was deferred until trach could be 
downsized. On ___, the patient complained of shortness of 
breath and was placed on the PSV/CPAP in the morning. The 
patient is intermittently on the vent for pressure support.  ACS 
was going to downsize her trach on ___, however they did not 
have the right equipment.  Her trach should be downsized per 
rehab with a SLP eval afterward.  Currently she has Portex 8.0 
in place, recommendation is to downsize to 6.0. She doesn't have 
too many secretions, and only requires intermittent suctioning.  
She does at times feel short of breath and asks for suction.  At 
other times she feels short of breath and because tachypneic 
requiring vent support, most recent settings ___ overnight PSV 
8 PEEP 5 FiO2 40%.  On transfer to rehab, she is on trach collar 
40% humidified air. 

#Cardiac
The patient was noted to be bradycardic on admission; 
norepinephrine was used to maintain MAP goal in setting of 
bradycardia. On ___, patient developed tachy arrhythmia so 
norepinephrine was transitioned to phenylephrine, with MAP 
goal>60.  On ___, the patient had a 6-beat run of SVT. A set of 
lytes were ordered and they were within normal limits. On ___ 
overnight the patients EKG had diffuse T-wave inversions (new), 
trop and CK-MB negative.  Patient did require a prolonged course 
of phenylephrine to maintain MAP >60 in setting of spine shock.  
Patient was weaned off pressors with addition of midodrine and 
florinef to regimen.  On discharge, patient is has been weaned 
to midodrine 5mg po TID.  Patient does have intermittent 
bradycardia to which she will brady to ___, and even with 5 
second pause.  She did require atropine 0.5mg IV 3 times during 
her stay, last dose given ___.  EP was consulted.  Their 
recommendation was to add theophylline 100mg po BID to patient's 
regimen to help with increased parasympathetic tone and 
autonomic instability.  Patient's bradycardia is thought to be a 
significant parasympathetic response in setting of C spine 
injury. Pacemaker or other instrumentation is not indicated in 
this situation. These episodes should self resolve, EP does not 
believe that atropine was helpful the 3 times it was given 
during this admission, but rather the patient responded on her 
own before effects of atropine could take effect.  Theophylline 
levels do not need to be monitored. 

#Pleural effusions
See "Respiratory" section for further details.  Patient did 
require significant diuresis during her stay, as well as 
bilateral pigtail catheters for pleural effusions.  On 
discharge, she is receiving 60mg po Lasix daily. 

#Hypotension
The patient was treated with midodrine for hypotension.

#Anemia
H&H were noted to be low during her hospitalization. The patient 
was transfused PRBC's on ___ with improvement in her H&H. On 
discharge, H and H stable at 8.6 and 26.9.

#GI
She was maintained NPO on tube feeds postoperatively. The 
patient continues on and off vent.  She underwent placement of a 
PEG on ___.  She needs follow up with SLP for re-eval of 
swallow once trach is downsized to Portex 6.0.  

#GU
The patient reported that she uses a pessary; which was removed. 
 Foley catheter was placed for urinary retention. Foley catheter 
was removed and replaced on ___ in order to allow rectal wound 
to heal.  

#ID 
-pneumonia 
CXR was suspicious for PNA on ___, she was started on 
cefepime and vanncomycin. On ___ Vanco was discontinued. On 
___ the patients WBC 19.1 from 13.2. fever overnight 100.7, 
urine/blood cx from ___ pending and mini BAL from ___ negative 
for microorganisms final culture is pending. On ___ the 
patient was febrile to 103, blood/urine/mini BAL was sent. 
Cefepime was continued at current dose. She was febrile on ___ 
to 103 and recultured. On ___ Cefepime was changed to meropenem 
for new growths from BAL. On ___ Meropenem completed and 
continued on Vanco for total of 7 day treatment. Frequent vanco 
levels were checked and vanco was titrated accordingly.  
-Yeast infection
She was started on Miconazole intravag. x 3 days for yeast 
(___)
- rectal wound
Patient did have a flexiseal in place for some time for 
diarrhea. Once flexiseal removed she was noted to have would by 
her rectum.  She was seen by wound RN, recommendation is OTA.
