History of Present Illness:
___ year old male with metastatic melanoma - currently on 
treatment study with CTLA4 antibody, who has been admitted 
multiple times to the hospital (twice at ___ for diarrhea 
felt to be autoimmune colitis related to therapy.  The diarrhea 
has improved on prednisone therapy, but he reports having high 
sugars at home.  

He presented to ___ today (___) for a CT torso and MRI.  
While waiting for the MRI, his lab results returned and revealed 
a BS > 700.  He was then referred to the ED for management.  
while in the ED he received IVF and 10 U of insulin x 2, with 
improvement of his BS to 190.  He reports symptoms of polyuria 
and polydipsia, but otherwise states he feels fine.  He is tired 
after being in the ED today.  ROS reviewed in detail and is 
otherwise negative.

He reports that he has been taking glargine 40 units every 
night, and has been checking his sugars in the morning.  They 
were elevated in the 200-400 range; his prednisone was tapered 
down approximately one week ago from prednisone 40 mg BID to 40 
mg in the am and 20 mg in the evening.  He states he did not 
know that he should continue metformin.  He states this was 
stopped a few days prior to a recent CT scan and misunderstood 
as to whether or not he should restart it.  He states he also 
did not realize that he should be checking his sugars more than 
once a day.

MRI HEAD ___:
FINDINGS: Since the previous study the patient has undergone 
resection of
right frontal enhancing mass lesion. Blood products are seen at 
the surgical site with a small area of slow diffusion involving 
the brain at the margin of surgical resection and most likely 
related to the surgical procedure. Following gadolinium there is 
no evidence of a definite area of residual enhancement 
identified in the right frontal region. The previously noted 
right posterior frontal enhancing lesion is also no longer 
visible. This lesion was also not visualized on the MRI of 
___ and ___. There remains some mass effect on the right 
lateral ventricle and corpus callosum. There is no 
hydrocephalus. 
IMPRESSION: Status post resection of right frontal tumor. 
Marginal slow
diffusion could be related to surgical procedure. Blood products 
at the
surgical site are seen without definite residual enhancement. 
Small bilateral subdurals appear related to the recent surgery. 
Pneumocephalus. Small areas of susceptibility as before.

CT Head ___:
FINDINGS: Multiple postoperative changes are notable in the 
brain including
osseous defects consistent with right frontal craniotomy. 
Subjacent to this
site is what is likely postoperative pneumocephalus. Right 
frontal defects
are consistent with surgical mass excision. There is adjacent 
right frontal
hypodensity, indicating edema, which was present on preoperative 
studies. A
small amount of hyperdense fluid is seen layering posteriorly 
within the
occipital horns of the lateral ventricles bilaterally consistent 
with a small amount of hemorrhage. There is no other evidence of 
large intracranial bleeding. There is no shift of normal midline 
structures. Apart from the surgical defects, visualized osseous 
structures are unremarkable. The paranasal sinuses are notable 
for mucosal thickening in the maxillary sinuses bilaterally, 
more prominently on the left. The mastoid air cells are clear. 
IMPRESSION: Multiple postoperative changes as detailed above. 
There is no
evidence of large postoperative intracranial bleeding.

EKG ___:
Sinus bradycardia
Normal ECG except for rate
Since previous tracing of ___, heart rate slower
 IntervalsAxes
___
___ y.o. M with widely metastatic melanoma including involvement 
of liver, lung, bone, subcutaneous nodules and multiple cerebral 
metastasis.  He is s/p IL therapy and
currently undergoing CTLA4 therapy.  The therapy is complicated 
by colitis requiring steroid treatment. The steroid was tapered 
to off in late ___.  While most of the systemic 
metastasis responded to CTLA4, the right frontal mass increased 
in size from ___ MRI (4 x 2.8 x 3 cm) to the ___ MRI 
(5.5 x 3.5 x 3.5 cm). Neurosurgery is consulted with regard to 
surgical resection of the lesion. Review of system is notable 
for increased frequency of HA as well as difficulty negotiating 
stairways. The wife states that the patient has a tendency to 
lean to one side.

He was admitted on ___ to begin work up for planned surgical 
resection of said frontal lesion.  He went to the OR on ___ for 
surgical resection.  Post-operatively he was maintained in the 
ICU for 24h of observation.  On POD#1, he was transferred to 
neurosurgery floor. Decadron taper to off was started.  
Neurological examination after surgery was intact, without focal 
deficit. He was seen and evaluated by physical and occupational 
therapy who determined he would be appropriate for home 
discharge with appropriate supervision.

MR HEAD W & W/O CONTRAST Study Date of ___ 5:44 AM 
COMPARISON: ___. FINDINGS: Patient is status post right 
frontoparietal craniotomy with associated post-surgical changes 
demonstrated. There is a stable right supratentorial convexity 
subdural fluid collection. There has been slight interval 
decrease in size of the small anterior right frontal epidural 
collection. Of note, there is restricted diffusion within the 
right frontal epidural fluid collection, decreased when compared 
to the prior exam, however, there is no definite evidence for 
enhancement, also accompanies the fact that there is intrinsic 
T1 hyperintensity seen and therefore likely represents apparent 
restricted diffusion, secondary to blood rather than abscess. 
There is stable nodular enhancement surrounding the right 
frontal resection cavity site predominantly in the posterior, 
medial and inferior aspects with associated persistent 
restricted diffusion, suggesting residual high-grade tumor. 
There has been interval increase in size of a posterior right 
frontal ring- enhancing metastatic lesion, measuring 6.3 mm, 
previously measuring 4 mm. There is a stable left inferior 
frontal focus of susceptibility which demonstrates slight 
decrease in enhancement when compared to the prior exam, also 
most consistent with a metastatic lesion. On the axials post 
gadolinium images of the posterior fossa, there are two areas of 
"apparent" enhancement in the left cerebellar hemisphere, likely 
representing artifact, given the fact that these are not 
correlated on other orthogonal post- axial images and FLAIR 
images. There is a stable, left greater than right, 
frontoparietal subgaleal fluid collection without restricted 
diffusion to suggest abscess. The orbital structures are 
unremarkable. There is mucosal thickening of the bilateral 
maxillary antrum and ethmoid air cells. There is a mucosal 
retention cyst in the left maxillary antrum. There has been 
interval resolution of the bilateral air- fluid levels within 
the maxillary antrum. IMPRESSION: 1. Findings most consistent 
with residual tumor surrounding predominantly the posterior, 
medial and inferior resection cavity margins in the right 
frontal resection cavity. Interval increase in right frontal 
metastatic lesion. Slight decrease in enhancement of left 
frontal metastatic lesion. 2. Stable right subdural fluid 
collection. 3. Interval decrease in size of right frontal 
epidural collection with associated restricted diffusion, 
however, no enhancement suggesting a likely hemorrhagic fluid 
collection rather than abscess. 4. Stable bi-frontoparietal 
subgaleal fluid collection. 5. Interval resolution of bilateral 
air-fluid levels within the maxillary antrum.
.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of ___ 4:39 ___ Portable AP 
chest radiograph was compared to ___ and CT torso 
from ___. The current study demonstrates right basal 
opacity obscuring partially the diaphragm that is new since the 
prior study and is worrisome for right lower lobe pneumonia. 
Left basal retrocardiac opacity most likely representing 
atelectasis or a combination of atelectasis with known 
mediastinal lymph nodes. There is no pleural effusion or 
pneumothorax. IMPRESSION: Right lower lobe opacity, worrisome 
for infection process, especially given the patient's clinical 
findings.
 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ y/o M with metastatic melanoma s/p R frontal craniotomy ___ 
with resection of mass, s/p Cyberknife ___, who presented to 
___ in ___ ___ for lethargy. He had reportedly 
been having increased seizure activity recently and his keppra 
was increased. Transferred to ___ overnight ___ at family 
request. Noted to have UTI with enterococcus at OSH and possible 
LLL PNA for which he was started on vanc/levoflox. He has 
notable ___ breathing when sleeping and has his own 
bipap machine. He improved dramatically with antibiotics. 
Ultimately it was believed that his altered MS was due to 
infection. His cultures grew Entercoccus sensitive to 
flouroquinolones and he was treated with levofloxacin. He was 
also given stress dose steroids and tapered. He was discharged 
to rehab with planned follow up. 
.
# Fever/altered mental status: Unclear etiology initially. DD 
included medication effect, progression of disease, or infection 
such as his PNA or UTI, although most concerning would be an

allergic) for UTI and PNA. Repeat CXR showed ongoing LLL 
infiltrate consistent with PNA. UCx at OSH positive for 
pan-sensitive Enterocooccus continuing only levofloxacin 750mg 
PO daily from ___ to ___
.
# Enterococcal UTI: UCx from OSH grew out enterococcus S to FQs 
as above. Rx as above.
.
