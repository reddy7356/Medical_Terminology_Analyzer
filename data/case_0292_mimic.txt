ECHO
IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. There is no evidence for a 
right-to-left shunt with
agitated saline at rest, though there was a lot of patient 
movement during the study and therefore
images are suboptimal and not definitive. Mild symmetric left 
ventricular hypertrophy with normal
cavity size and regional/global biventricular systolic function. 
Mild resting mid-cavitary LV
gradient. No valvular pathology or pathologic flow identified. 
Normal pulmonary artery systolic
pressure.

CTA CHEST:
IMPRESSION: 
  
  
1. No evidence of pulmonary embolism. 
2. Multiple, bilateral pulmonary nodules, measuring up to 2 mm, 
for which no 
dedicated CT follow-up is recommended in a low risk patient, and 
an optional 
CT follow-up in 12 months is recommended in a high risk patient. 

3. No substantial change in a intrathoracic multinodular thyroid 
goiter, with 
rightward tracheal deviation. 
  
RECOMMENDATION(S):  For incidentally detected multiple solid 
pulmonary nodules 
smaller than 6mm, no CT follow-up is recommended in a low-risk 
patient, and an 
optional CT follow-up in 12 months is recommended in a high-risk 
patient. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ is a ___ female ___ female with history of 
thyroid goiter, pancreatic insufficiency, GERD, frequent UTIs 
who presents from outside hospital with concerns for hypoxia and 
neck mass

# Hypoxia
# Neck mass/Goiter
# Asthma
# Lung nodules
Hypoxia resolved.  This occurred incidentally at ___ ___.  
She had no symptoms other than recent cough.  She has h/o 
asthma/COPD.  CTA chest noted atelectasis.  ENT evaluated 
patient's known goiter and didnot think it was contributing to 
her hypoxia.  TFTs wnl.  It was possible she is having 
intermittent symptoms, or this was a transient finding related 
to recent URI, asthma, and atelectasis.  Echo re-assuring (see 
above).  This was likely due to atelectasis vs recent URI with 
asthma and resolved.  Goiter is not playing a role.
