History of Present Illness:
HPI: The pt is a ___ year-old right-handed woman w/HTN, DM,
dementia, and pulmonary fibrosis who presents with large
intraparenchymal hemorrhage.  The patient reportedly was last
normal earlier this afternoon, when she had come down to ___
to stay with her children.  Around 5:30pm she began complaining
of a headache.  She went to the bedroom to lie down, and
according to her family she was snoring.  Around 8pm her 
daughter
went to check on her, and found that she had wet herself, and 
her
left side seemed stiff, with her face somewhat contorted.  The
patient was still responsive at that time, and when the daughter
mentioned that she had wet herself, the patient responded 'I
know, and used her right arm to try to pull down her pants to
help clean up.  Her daughter called the ambulance, and the
patient was taken to ___.  Reportedly the
patient was continuing to talk to her family up until the
ambulance came.

She was taken to ___ where she reportedly was 
speaking
'insensible words' and was responding to pain on the right side. 

Her blood pressure at the time of admission was 218/103 for 
which
she was given 20mg IV labetalol, and then started on a labetolol
drip.  She had a head CT which showed a 7.5 cm right sided 
corona
radiata intraparenchymal hemorrage.  According to the ED
physician taking care of her, she was then intubated for airway
protection, and prophylactically loaded with 50g of mannitol and
1g of phosphenytoin.  The ED physician noted that she required 
no
medication for the initial intubation, however did bite down on
the tube, requiring succinylcholine.  She was then transferred 
to
___ for further evaluation.

Imaging:

Radiology Report CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST Study Date of ___ 
1:16 AM 
FINDINGS: There is a large right fronta/parietal/temporal 
parenchymal 
hemorrhage, similar to three hours prior and measuring 7.1 cm in 
(AP) x 3.1 cm 
(TRV). There is an unchanged mild surrounding rim of edema. It 
appears that 
the hemorrhage may not involve the lentiform nucleus, but rather 
displace it 
medially. 
  
There is unchanged moderate leftward shift of midline 
structures. The 
midbrain is slightly distorted. While the right uncus abuts the 
midbrain, no 
herniation is seen at this time. 
  
There is unchanged compression of frontal horn, body and 
occipital horn of the 
right lateral ventricle, as well as of the third ventricle. 
Blood is again 
seen in the occipital horns of the lateral ventricles, slighlty 
increased in 
conspicuity on the left. 
  
There is mild cerebral atrophy with associated sulcal 
prominence. 
  
The bones are unremarkable. The visualized paranasal sinuses and 
mastoid air 
cells are well aerated. Endotracheal and orogastric tubes are 
seen on the 
scout images. 
  
IMPRESSION: 
  
1. Unchanged large right parenchymal hemorrhage with surrounding 
edema. The 
hemorrhage may be lobar as it appears to spare the lentiform 
nucleus, although 
evaluation is slightly limited due to mass effect. Work-up for 
an underlying 
vascular abnormality or mass should be considered. 
  
2. Unchanged mass effect and leftward shift of midline 
structures, including 
mild distortion of the midbrain. While the right uncus abuts the 
midbrain, 
there is no evidence of herniation at this time. 
  
3. Unchanged compression of the third and right lateral 
ventricles. Small 
amount of intraventricular blood in the occipital horns, 
slightly increased in 
conspicuity on the left. 
  
Radiology Report CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of ___ 3:44 
AM 
IMPRESSION: 
1. ET tube remains approximately 8 mm above the carina, directed 
towards the 
right main bronchus. 
2. NG tube in proximal stomach, with side port above the 
diaphragm. 
3. Persistent bilateral interstitial edema superimposed on 
probable 
interstial lung disease, right greater than left. 

Radiology Report CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST Study Date of ___ 
10:38 AM 
 
IMPRESSION: 
  
No significant change the large right lobar parenchymal 
hemorrhage and 
intraventricular hemorrhage. Unchanged mass effect. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ is a ___ yo right handed woman with pulmonary fibrosis, 
DM, HTN and dementia, admitted with left sided weakness and 
altered mental status, found to have a large right sided 
intraparenchymal hemorrhage.

1. Intraparenchymal hemorrhage.  On admission the patient was 
found to have a 7cm x 3cm intraparenchymal hemorrhage with a 
small amount of extension into the ventricles.  It was felt to 
be due to probable amyloid angiopathy. She was evaluated by 
neurosurgery, however given her multiple comorbidities, and 
suspected poor outcome, the decision was made to not intervene 
surgically.  She was monitored with serial CT scans.  Blood 
pressure was maintained with labetalol.  She was been started on 
phenytoin for seizure prophylaxis, and EEG results showed slow 
disorganized background with a right subcortical lesion.  
Clinically she remained unresponsive, off sedation.

2. Respiratory.  Ms. ___ was initially intubated at the outside 
hospital for airway protection.  She remained on the ventilator. 
 She did undergo a trial of CPAP, but had to be transitioned 
back to the ventilator as had multiple episodes of apnea.

3. Goals of care.  A family meeting was held on ___ with all 5 
of the patient's children.  It was discussed that prior to this 
current illness the patient had commented that she would not 
want to be kept alive on a ventilator, and would not want to 
have to live in a nursing home.  It was discussed that based on 
her neurologic condition, she would likely need to undergo 
placement of a PEG and trach.  It was agreed by the family that 
this would not be within the context of their mother's goals of 
care, and the decision was made to transition her to CMO.  She 
was electively extubated on ___.  She was given morphine and 
Ativan for comfort.  On ___ the patient expired, with her 
family at the bedside.
