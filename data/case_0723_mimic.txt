Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ is a ___ woman with a history of IDDM who presents 
with a painful ulcer on her posterior lower extremity, found to 
have cellulitis not responsive to outpatient oral therapy, 
referred by her podiatrist for admission to medicine for IV 
antibiotics.
  
#Diabetic ulcer w/ cellulitis: The patient has a 2x3 cm ulcer 
that is a result of a traumatic blister, complicated by 
secondary infection. She has failed over 2 weeks of outpatient 
clindamycin and cipro. In the ED she was afebrile without a 
leukocytosis. She was started on vancomycin, levofloxacin, and 
metronidazole (antibiotic choice complicated by allergy to 
penicillin). She had a lower extremity Xray which showed no 
indication of osteomyelitis. On ___ she was transitioned to 
cipro and clinda per podiatry recommendations, but the following 
day she had worsening leg pain and erythema. Of note, she has 
failed a course of clinda and then a course of clinda/cipro as 
an outpatient and a superficial swab of her wound at the time 
grew multiple different Enterobacteriaceae and Enterococcus all 
of them pan-sensitive. Because of this, Infectious Diseases was 
consulted on ___ and there was concern for osteomyelitis. She 
was started on tigeycline. On ___ she had an MRI of her left 
lower extremity which showed no evidence of osteomyelitis. She 
was experiencing some episodes of hypoglycemia attributed to 
tigacycline. On ___ she was transitioned to vancomycin, cipro, 
and metronidazole, and then on ___ she was transitioned to 
linezolid and cipro. She was discharged on this regimen to 
complete an 8 day course. 

# Nausea/vomiting: The morning of ___ the patient developed 
vomiting and diarrhea after eating breakfast. Her BGs were in 
the ___ thereafter. Because of the acuity of her symptoms 
and her history of being on antibiotics stool cultures were sent 
for C.diff and PCR sent for Norovirus. The etiology of her 
symptoms may have been secondary to her linezolid. Overnight 
___ the patient has had no nausea or vomiting and has had 4 
loose BMs. Her symptoms then resolved. Her C.diff returned 
negative and Norovirus PCR was pending at time of discharge. 

#IDDM: The patient's last A1c 8.4% ___, c/b neuropathy. 
During hospital stay she had intermittent episodes of 
hypoglycemia to the ___ that became more frequent after the 
initiation of tigecycline. Her home glargine of 80u qAM and 45 u 
qPM was decreased by 50% (40 u qAM and 22 u qPM) and her 
standing 12u of Humalog was held. She was on a low ISS as well. 
Her blood sugars remained well controlled on this regimen and 
she was instructed to continue with this regimen after discharge 
until follow up with her PCP.

#Hypertensive urgency: On admission, the patient's SBP was > 200 
in the setting of missing all of her antihypertensives that day. 
She denied headache, vision changes, CP, SOB, or other 
neurological symptoms. She continued to be hypertensive to 190s 
and so on ___ her metoprolol was stopped and she was switched to 
labetalol, which was eventually uptitrated to 600 mg TID. She 
also restarted home lisinopril after resolution of her ___. She 
continued home clonidine and amlodipine. Her SBPs were in the 
150s-160s on day of discharge.

___ on CKD: On admission the patient's creatinine was elevated 
to 2.5, from a baseline of 1.4-1.8 (last month was 1.8). She 
likely has CKD from hypertension and diabetic nephropathy with 
an overlying ___. Initially the patient's lisinopril and home 
furosemide was held, but then restarted. By day of discharge her 
creatinine was stable at 2.1.
 
#Diabetic foot ulcer: The patient presented with a right 
Achilles heel ulcer which was followed by wound care and 
podiatry with daily dressing changes. Per podiatry, there was no 
need for surgical intervention. Her wound showed no signs of 
infection during hospitalization. Her legs were elevated for 
comfort. 

#Asthma: The patient continued on home albuterol prn and flovent 
BID. 
 
#HLD: The patient continued on home atorvastatin 80 mg daily.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
[] Patient was discharged home on an 8 day course of linezolid 
and ciprofloxacin, day 1 ___, day 8 ___.
[] Patient's home metoprolol was stopped and the patient was 
discharged home on labetalol 600 mg TID
[] Patient's home insulin regimen was changed. She will be 
discharged on 40u glargine qAM and 22u glargine qPM (this is 50% 
of the regimen she was taking prior to admission). Her standing 
12u Humalog with meals was stopped. She should follow up as an 
outpatient.

leg x 1 day. 

ACTIVE ISSUES
=============
# HFpEF exacerbation: TTE this admission with EF 76% with severe 
LVH. No clear inciting factor for exacerbation, most likely 
etiology worsening renal function leading to volume overload. 
Atrius cardiology followed inpatient. Diuresed well with 120 IV 
Lasix BID from admission weigh 232lb to discharge weight 213.4 
lb. Switched to Torsemide 40mg QD on discharge. Will follow up 
with ___ cardiology given insurance change.

# HTN: Quite hypertensive to SBP > 180s inpatient. Increased 
isosorbide and added hydralazine with some improvement, however 
still average SBP 140-160s on discharge. Continued home 
amlodipine. Decreased dose of carvedilol given # sinus pause 
below.

# ___ on CKD: Patient with worsening renal function, from 
baseline ~4.8 to 6.4 on admission. Nephrology consulted, felt 
secondary to worsening diabetic nephropathy with some component 
of cardiorenal physiology driving ___ as well. Renal US without 
hydronephrosis. Vascular mapping done as part of pre-HD 
planning, will follow up with ___ nephrology and transplant 
surgery as an outpatient to arrange HD access.

# Sinus pause / nausea / hypotension: Occurred on ___, seemed 
consistent with vagal episodes inciting Mobitz 1 block and 
transient relative hypotension. Troponin and CKMB stable x 2 
checks. Decreased beta blockade (cardevilol 25 -> 12.5 BID) with 
no recurrence of symptoms.

# ___ blister: Likely in setting of HFpEF exacerbation. Appeared 
to be transudative surface layer blister. Wound nurse consulted 
___, followed wound care recs.

# DM: Dose reduced insulin glargine from 10U to 8U QHS.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms ___,

You were admitted to the hospital with fluid overload (a "heart 
failure exacerbation"). We gave you high doses of IV Lasix to 
remove this fluid, and your breathing improved. You were 
discharged on a stronger medicine similar to Lasix called 
Torsemide, which should prevent fluid from building up in the 
future.

Your kidney function has been getting worse over the last few 
years, and it's getting to the point where you may need dialysis 
soon. The kidney doctors saw ___ in the hospital, and you will 
see them again in clinic to start planning for this process.

Your insurance changed recently, and you will be seeing a new 
group of doctors at ___, not at ___. Your insurance 
records are incomplete. You will need to call out registration 
department at ___ BEFORE your first appointment. Our 
Financial Assistance office number is ___ if you need 
further help with your follow up appointment payment coverage.

Please weigh yourself every day. If your weight goes up or down 
by over 3lb in one day or 5lb in 2 days, call your primary care 
doctor, as you may need to change your medication dosage.

You should also keep an eye on your urine. If it seems like you 
are urinating much less there would be concern your kidneys 
aren't working, and you should either call your new primary care 
doctor or go to the ER.

It was a privilege to care for you in the hospital, and we wish 
you all the best.

Sincerely,

Your ___ Team

Brief Hospital Course:
___ yo F with hx of HFpEF, HTN, CKD Stage V, T2DM presenting with 
dyspnea and need for HD initiation per outpatient nephrologist 
for having failed outpatient volume management with diuretics.

ACUTE ISSUES:
=============
#CKD Stage V
#Dyspnea
#Need for HD initiation
Presented with dyspnea though no O2 requirement. Also had 
markedly edematous eyelids and bilateral lower extremity edema. 
Cr on admission was 6.4, which is not improved from her last 
admission. Cr was 2.2 back in ___. Per renal, likely failed 
outpatient volume management and will initiate HD. Patient is in 
agreement. Likely ___ cardiorenal vs. diuretic refractoriness. 
Had an episode of acute worsening of dyspnea likely due to flash 
pulmonary edema given symptoms and CXR findings. Symptoms 
quickly resolved with IV furosemide 160mg x2 daily and 
supplemental O2. O2 was weaned to ___. Right sided tunneled 
dialysis line placed on ___. Patient tolerated initiation of 
dialysis well, though had some fatigue. After dialysis was 
started (with continued IV furosemide 160mg x1 on non-dialysis 
days), her respiratory status and edema resolved, and she 
remained on RA with stable improvement for the few days leading 
up to discharge. She was set up to receive outpatient dialysis 
at ___ Dialysis ___ on a ___ schedule. Renal 
recommended continuing home torsemide 40mg daily on non-dialysis 
days.

#HTN
Hard to control on previous admissions, likely ___ CKD. ProBNP 
2182 on admission, last admission it was 2289. Persistently 
hypertensive to 150s-180s systolic despite being on home 
carvedilol, amlodipine, isosorbide mononitrate, and hydralazine 
100mg Q8H. Dialysis was initiated with improvement of 
respiratory symptoms but she remained hypertensive both during 
and after each of 3 sessions. Home doxazosin was still being 
held given evidence of possibly increased mortality, and she was 
started on lisinopril 10 with renal agreeing. Following the 
addition of lisinopril and continued dialysis/diuresis, 
systolics decreased and stabilized in the 120s-150s.

#___
Patient recently admitted and discharged on ___ for acute 
exacerbation of CHF. Last discharge weight of 97 kg. Current 
admission weight of 99.29 kg. Had episode of flash pulmonary 
edema as detailed above. Following HD initiation (received 3 
sessions in hospital), continued diuresis with IV furosemide on 
non-dialysis days, and blood pressure control, patient's dyspnea 
and edema resolved. Discharge weight 94.1kg.

# Peripheral neuropathy
Patient has chronic tingling in her hands and feet at night, 
likely diabetic neuropathy. Started on gabapentin at HD dosing 
(100 qhs) with good response.

# Stress urinary incontinence
Reports this is chronic ___ years, no prior interventions, plan 
for outpatient UroGyn evaluation, might also benefit from 
Women's Health / Pelvic floor physical therapy evaluation & 
treatment as outpatient.

CHRONIC ISSUES:
===============
#Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus
Stable. Continued home lantus 10 u at bedtime in addition to 
hospital insulin sliding scale.

#Normocytic anemia
Stable. Recent baseline ~8.5. Likely ___ CKD. Continued home 
ferrous sulfate every other day.

#H/o CVA, infarcts in left frontal lobe and right basal ganglia
Stable. No residual weakness. Presumed ischemic given multiple 
risk factors. Continued home aspirin 81 mg and home atorvastatin 
80 mg

Brief Hospital Course:
SUMMARY:
====================
___ is a ___ old lady with history of heart 
failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), severe 
hypertension, chronic kidney disease (CKD) stage V, and type 2 
diabetes mellitus on insulin who presents with acute 
exacerbation of diastolic heart failure in the setting of 
running out of her home Torsemide. 

ACTIVE ISSUES:
====================
# Acute exacerbation of heart failure with preserved ejection 
fraction (___)
Ms. ___ presented on ___ with 4 days of orthopnea and 
lower extremity edema. BNP on ___ was 2289. Her weight on 
admission (___) was 102.47 Kg up from her dry weight of 96.8 
Kg on ___. The patient reports missing home torsemide due to 
insurance issues. TTE from ___ demonstrated ejection fraction 
of 75% and severe left ventricular hypertrophy. The patient 
received a total of 4 doses of 120mg IV Lasix over the course of 
this admission. For afterload management, we optimized her blood 
pressure management (see below). The patient responded well to 
IV Lasix despite poor kidney function. She is not a candidate 
for spironolactone given renal dysfunction. On ___, the 
patient was comfortable breathing and switched back to Torsemide 
40mg oral daily. Her discharge weight was 97 Kg. 

# Hypertension
Patient with persistent elevated blood pressure 
(170s-200s/70s-90s) despite being on 5 different 
antihypertensive medications. During this admission, we 
increased hydralazine dose to 100mg TID and carvedilol to 25mg 
BID. In addition, we continued home isosorbide mononitrate 120mg 
daily, amlodipine 10mg daily and doxazosin 4mg daily. We think 
that her hypertension is a result of CKD. 

# Chronic Kidney disease (CKD) stage V 
Patient with admission Cr of 6.3, similar to prior discharge. 
Her worsening kidney function is thought to be secondary to 
worsening diabetic nephropathy. Renal US from ___ without 
evidence of hydronephrosis. Vascular mapping was done on ___ 
as part of pre-HD planning. Quantiferon-TB gold test is pending. 
The patient is scheduled to follow up with nephrology and 
transplant surgery as an outpatient. 

CHRONIC ISSUES:
====================
# History of CVA, infarcts in the left frontal lobe and right 
basal ganglia: No residual weakness. Presumed ischemic given 
multiple risk factors. 
- Continued aspirin 81 mg
- Continued atorvastatin 80 mg

# Normocytic anemia: Recent baseline ~8.5. Most probably in the 
setting of chronic kidney disease. Her iron supplementation was 
changed from once daily to every other day based on new 
guidelines. 

# Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus
- Continued home lantus 10U + SSI. Last A1c 9.5% in ___

History of Present Illness:
Ms. ___ is a pleasant ___ woman with DM and HTN who 
presents with inability to lift her right foot for the last 3 
weeks. On ___, she was at work when she realized that she was 
unable to write like she normally does. Her handwriting was 
"like a third grader's," and she was unable to write the letters 
s, e, f, and r properly. She also thought her speech "wasn't 
what is usually is because I have the gift of gab" and was 
having trouble finding the words she wanted. She then noticed 
that her right leg felt funny below the knee, and she felt like 
it was numb and heavy. She was unable to lift it off the ground 
and was also unable to put her shoe on. Her arm and speech 
started feeling better, but her leg weakness still persisted. 
She was still able to walk but continues to complain of foot 
heaviness. Because of this, she went to her PCP to be evaluated. 
She was subsequently referred to the ED for further workup upon 
speaking with her PCP. EKG also showed inverted T waves in 1 and 
v6, which is a change from her last EKG. 

Also of note, she has had a 20 pound unintentional weight loss.

IMAGING 
==================
NCHCT ___: 
1. Acute to subacute infarct involving the left frontal lobe.  
No acute hemorrhage or mass effect. 
2. Chronic right basal ganglia infarct and age-related 
involutional changes. 

MRI/MRA head and neck ___: IMPRESSION:  
1. Focus of restricted diffusion in the left frontal lobe with 
associated FLAIR hyperintense signal, near the vertex is 
compatible with an late acute infarction.  Additional FLAIR and 
diffusion-weighted hyperintense signal of the left medial 
frontal lobe is compatible with subacute infarcts. 
2. There is short-segment high-grade stenosis of the left A2, as 
well as stenosis of the bilateral A2-A3 junction.  Multifocal 
narrowing of the distal MCA branches, basilar and posterior 
cerebral arteries are identified.  These may be secondary to 
atherosclerotic disease. 
3. Attenuation of signal within the left vertebral artery, 
particularly along the V4 segment may be secondary high-grade 
stenosis/occlusion although artifact from slow flow secondary to 
a congenitally diminutive vessel is a consideration.  When 
clinically feasible, contrast-enhanced study is recommend for 
further evaluation.  No other abnormalities are seen within the 
vessels of the neck. 
4. Unchanged likely arachnoid cyst within the sella turcica, 
compared to the prior MRI from ___. 
5. Changes secondary to chronic infarction within the right 
basal ganglia. 
  
CXR ___: Cardiomegaly. No acute process. 

ECHO ___ 
IMPRESSION: Moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with 
preserved regional and global biventricular systolic function. 
Dilated ascending aorta. No valvular pathology or pathologic 
flow identified. No definite structural cardiac source of 
embolism identified.

IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. 
The patient has a mildly dilated ascending aorta. Based on ___ 
ACCF/AHA Thoracic Aortic Guidelines, if not previously known or 
a change, a follow-up echocardiogram is suggested in ___ year; if 
previously known and stable, a follow-up echocardiogram is 
suggested in ___ years.  
 
Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ is a ___ yo woman with multiple vascular risk factors 
(HTN, DM, HLD) who presented with 3 week history of RLE weakness 
that was originally accompanied by RUE weakness and word finding 
difficulties. RUE weakness and word finding difficulties had 
resolved, but exam showed apraxia and UMN pattern weakness in 
her RLE. NCHCT showed a hypodensity in the L frontal lobe and 
chronic R basal ganglia infarct. 

# R lower extremity weakness likely ___ ischemic stroke: We 
followed up her MRI/MRA head and neck without contrast, which 
showed consistent findings with the NCHCT. 

We worked her up for stroke risk factors, which showed HbA1c 
9.5%, total cholesterol 277, LDL 193. Her blood pressures were 
high throughout the hospital stay with SBP up to 190 despite 
many BP medications(amlodipine 10 mg daily, lisinopril 40 mg, 
metoprolol 50 BID , and torsemide 40 daily). Her ECHO did not 
show PFO (did show mildly dilated ascending aorta, and should 
have repeat ECHO in one year.

Given her cardiovascular risk factors, we started aspirin 81 mg 
qday, and then we also added on Plavix before discharge. In 
terms of her diabetes, she reported poor sugar control with FSG 
ranging from ___. We consulted ___, who met with her and 
recommended changes to insulin regimen as below. She was already 
on atorvastatin 80 mg q day, and would recommend dietary changes 
and close PCP monitoring of lipid levels. In terms of her 
hypertension, we did not change any medications, but recommend 
outpatient titration to SBP 140-180 from a neurological 
standpoint.

# Hypertension: Given that patient was 3 weeks out from initial 
event, we restarted home BP medications. We continued home 
lisinopril 40mg po qd, metoprolol 50mg po BID, torsemide 40mg po 
am, amlodipine 10mg po qd. We also restarted clonidine patch.
In terms of her hypertension, we did not change any medications, 
but recommend outpatient titration to SBP 140-180 from a 
neurological standpoint.

# DM2 with retinopathy, nephropathy, and neuropathy: We halved 
home lantus to 40 u qam and 23u qpm just in case pt was not 
compliant with home insulin. We also halved home Humalog to 8u 
TID AC. Her HbA1c was 9.5% suggesting poor control of blood 
sugars. Her FSG ranged from 100-230's. We consulted ___, who 
recommended the following:
-  Continue Lantus 40units in the AM, 23Units QHS
-  Change scheduled humalog with meals to 8 units with meals 
-  Change the correction scale insulin to humalog (and not 
regular) but keep the same intervals and dosing. 
- Follow up at ___ 

We also decreased home gabapentin 600mg TID to BID for renal 
dosing 

# CKD likely ___ diabetes and HTN: FENA 5.2%. We avoided 
nephrotoxic agents.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
- Hypertensive to 140-193 during this admission. Neurologically, 
we recommend the systolic blood pressure goal to be 140-180. BP 
meds should be titrated on an outpatient basis with this goal in 
mind
- Patient should start taking Aspirin and Plavix daily
- Mildly dilated ascending aorta: please schedule up follow up 
ECHO in ___ year
- HbA1c 9.5%. Seen by ___ Diabetes, who recommended:
---Continue Lantus 40units in the AM, 23Units QHS
---Change scheduled humalog with meals to 8 units with meals. 
---Hold sliding scale to simplify. 
---Pt should follow up with ___ for close diabetes care given 
difficult to control glucose
- ___ for further strengthening at home 
 
Medications on Admission:

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___, 

You were admitted because you had not been able to lift your 
right foot for at least 3 weeks, had difficulty with your right 
arm, were having difficulty finding words, and also noticed you 
were unable to write normally. You found that the arm strength 
was improving and could find your words more easily, but that 
the right foot continued to be weak. 

We did imaging studies of your brain, which showed that you had 
a stroke in the front part of your brain. 

A stroke is a condition where a blood vessel providing oxygen 
and nutrients to the brain is blocked by a clot. The brain is 
the part of your body that controls and directs all the other 
parts of your body, so damage to the brain from being deprived 
of its blood supply can result in a variety of symptoms. 

We looked at your risk factors for experiencing a stroke. We 
found that these risk factors included your high blood pressure, 
diabetes, and high cholesterol. 

It will be very important to try to control your blood pressure, 
your blood sugars, and your cholesterol levels in order to 
prevent future strokes.

We had the diabetes doctors from ___ to you about 
strategies to gain better control over your sugars. They 
recommended some changes to your insulin regimen. You should 
continue Lantus 40units in the morning, 23Units in the evening. 
You should CHANGE scheduled humalog with meals to 8 units with 
breakfast and lunch, but decrease dinner dose to 6 units.

During your hospitalization, your blood pressure was high. 
Because of your recent stroke, we did not add any new 
medications, but you should follow up with your primary care 
doctor about any further changes. 

Your cholesterol was also noted to be very high. The normal 
cholesterol level is 100 or less. Your cholesterol (LDL) is 193. 
You should continue to take atorvastatin 80 mg every day and eat 
a healthy diet to control your cholesterol levels. 

We have also started you on Aspirin and Plavix, two medications 
which you should continue taking daily to help decrease the risk 
of clot or stroke. 

If you ever develop any new similar symptoms like weakness in a 
part of your body, difficulty findings words or confused speech, 
please seek medical attention IMMEDIATELY instead of waiting for 
days or weeks. 

It was a pleasure taking care of you. We wish you all the best!

Sincerely,
Your ___ Neurology team
