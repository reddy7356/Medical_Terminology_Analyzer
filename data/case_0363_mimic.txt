Brief Hospital Course:
ASSESSMENT/PLAN: This is a ___ gentleman with a pmhx. of 
CAD and hyperlipidemia who is admitted from ___'s office with 
symptomatic 12-point hct drop in setting of ASA/Plavix.  

Upper bleed: He presented with chest pain after multiple 
episodes of melena.  The pt HCT was 22 on arrival down from 34.  
He was started on an IV PPI and transfused 5 units of blood and 
HCT was 31.8 on discharge.  He had an EGD showed no active 
bleeding. There were gastric ulcers and diffuse erosions.  A 
biopsy was done of an irregularity and is pending.  He was 
discharged on omeprazole 40mg BID. 

H pylori: His h pylori antibody was positive. GI recommended tx 
for h pylori although biopsies are still pending.  He was 
discharged on amoxicillin, clarithromycin, and omeprazole x 14 
days.

Chest pain: He ruled out for MI. His chest pain was likely 
demand ischemia in the setting of a low HCT. His ASA was 
decreased to 81mg daily.  He was continued on plavix due to his 
recent stent placement and continued on his statin. We intended 
to discharge him on his home dose of metoprolol but he was 
concerned that the metoprolol was making him dizzy. This is 
likely because he was having a GI bleed at the time.  He only 
felt comfortable being discharged on metoprolol 12.5mg BID. This 
will likely need to be increased to 25mg BID at his follow up 
PCP ___.

Excercise Stress Test ___
INTERPRETATION: This was a ___ year old man with a known history 
of 
CAD (stent ___ who was referred to the lab from the inpatient 
floor 
for an evaluation of chest discomfort with exertion. He 
exercised for 9 
minutes of ___ protocol ___ METs) and stopped due to 
fatigue and 
shortness of breath. This represents an excellent functional 
capacity 
for his age. He denied any chest, arm, neck or back discomfort 
throughout the study. There was 1-1.5mm slow upsloping ST 
segment 
depression in leads 2,3,F,V5-6 noted throughout exercise, which 
appeared 
to return back to baseline near 3 minutes of recovery. At 4 
minutes of 
recovery, the ST segments in leads 2,3,F showed 0.5-1mm 
"scooping" and 
V5-V6 0.5mm downsloping ST segment depression. This all returned 
back to 
baseline by an extended 12 minute recovery. The rhythm was sinus 
with 
rare APB's and PVC's in early recovery. The heart rate and blood 

pressure responded appropriately to exercise and recovery. 
.  
IMPRESSION: Non-specific ST segment changes in recovery. No 
anginal 
type symptoms reported. Excellent functional capacity 
demonstrated. 
Compared to prior study of ___, ST segment changes in 
recovery are 
new. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
HOSPITAL COURSE:
This is a ___ year old gentleman with a history of coronary 
artery disease status post recent drug eluting stents x 2, 
hyperlipidemia who presents with worsening symptoms of chest 
pressure for five days.
.
ACTIVE ISSUES:
# CORONARIES: Patient has known CAD, with 3VD, status post DES

PDA presented with symptoms of crescendo angina.  He had a 
normal excercise stress two weeks prior to admission concerning 
for an acute process related to prior PDA lesion or re-stenosis 
of one of the previously placed stents. Three sets of sets of 
cardiac biomarkers were negative and EKGs were unremarkable and 
unchanged from prior.  A coronary angiogram was recommended and 
offered to the patient who declined invasive procedures prior to 
further imaging of his heart. An excerise tolerance test was 
instead performed which revealed "Non-specific ST segment 
changes in recovery. No anginal type symptoms reported. 
Excellent functional capacity demonstrated. Compared to prior 
study of ___, ST segment changes in recovery are new." The 
patient's primary cardiologist, Dr. ___ the study 
and patient and felt it was safe to have the patient discharged 
with close follow-up.  He was started on a beta blocker prior to 
discharge. Lipid profile was pending at the time of discharge.

# Anemia: On admission, the patient was noted to have a 
normocytic anemia that improved to a hematocrit of 30 to 35 at 
the time of discharge. His stool was guaic postive in the 
emergency department.  The patient had a normal colonscopy in 
___.  He will need this anemia worked-up in the outpatient 
setting, and may require an EGD. His primary care physician was 
notified regarding his hospitalization and laboratory findings.
