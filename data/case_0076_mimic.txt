# Bacterial UTI with Chronic Foley: UA positive and perhaps mild 
suprapubic tenderness on exam, has chronic indwelling Foley for 
urinary retention (see below) which was changed. Since no recent 
known fevers and CVA tenderness not impressive on exam, unlikely 
pyelonephritis. Has had recent instrumentation. She was started 
on ceftriaxone ___. Urine cultures from Atrius ___ were 
negative. Urine cultures here were negative for final read. She 
was discharged with a 5 day course of ceftriaxone transitioned

hypokalemia. She was able to adequately hydrate with PO's, but 
still having intermittent diarrhea. C diff was negative. She was 
discharged with two day supply of Lomotil.

# Leukocytosis: Likely due to UTI vs infectious diarrhea. CXR 
and history does not suggest PNA. LFT's were normal. WBC trended 
down with hydration. 

# Urinary retention: Unclear cause of urinary retention in 
outpatient setting and s/p negative cystoscopy. Has urology f/u. 
No evidence of obstruction on recent CT other than distended 
bladder. No recent med changes. No back pain, weakness in ___ on 
exam or sensory changes to suggest cord compression. The 
patient's Foley was changed and she will continue to follow up 
with urology.

# Colon cancer: Patient not aware of diagnosis (has not been 
told, but also unlikely to be able to participated in care 
decisions based on my conversations with her today). She has 
outpt follow-up with ___ urology.

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted to the hospital after a Right Laparoscopic 
Colectomy for surgical management of your colon cancer. You have 
recovered from this procedure well. Samples from your colon were 
taken and this tissue has been sent to the pathology department 
for analysis. You will receive these pathology results at your 
follow-up appointment. If there is an urgent need for the 
surgeon to contact you regarding these results they will contact 
you before this time. You have tolerated a regular diet, passing 
gas, having bowel movements and your pain is controlled with 
pain medications by mouth. You are now ready to be discharged to 
a rehab facility to help you regain your strength before going 
back your assisted living home. 

You had a urinary tract infection while you were here and we 
started you on an oral antibiotic. You should take this as 
directed for 3 more days. Also, your blood pressure was high 
during your stay and you were started on an oral blood pressure 
medication called metoprolol. You should continue this until you 
follow up with your primary care physician in the next week to 
determine future high blood pressure treatment. 

Please monitor your bowel function closely. Some loose stool and 
passing of small amounts of dark, old appearing blood are 
expected however, if you notice that you are passing bright red 
blood with bowel movements or having loose stool without 
improvement please call the office or go to the emergency room 
if the symptoms are severe. If you are taking narcotic pain 
medications there is a risk that you will have some 
constipation. Please take an over the counter stool softener 
such as Colace, and if the symptoms do not improve call the 
office. If you have any of the following symptoms please call 
the office for advice or go to the emergency room if severe: 
increasing abdominal distension, increasing abdominal pain, 
nausea, vomiting, inability to tolerate food or liquids, 
prolonged loose stool, or constipation.

which are closed with internal sutures and are covered with 
steri strips. Do not remove the steri-strips, these will fall 
off on their own in the next week. These incisions are healing 
well however it is important that you monitor these areas for 
signs and symptoms of infection including: increasing redness of 
the incision lines, white/green/yellow/malodorous drainage, 
increased pain at the incision, increased warmth of the skin at 
the incision, or swelling of the area. Please call the office if 
you develop any of these symptoms or a fever. You may go to the 
emergency room if your symptoms are severe. You may shower; pat 
the incisions dry with a towel, do not rub. The small incisions 
may be left open to the air.  Please no baths or swimming for 4 
weeks after surgery unless told otehrwise by Dr. ___.
