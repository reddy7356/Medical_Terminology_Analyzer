Brief Hospital Course:
ASSESSMENT & PLAN: ___ yrs. yo F with PMH NIDDM on metformin who 
presents with dizziness and lightheadedness progressively 
worsening x 3 weeks found to be in DKA.

# DKA: Patient hyperglycemic presenting initially with anion gap 
of 35 and pH 7.28. U/A with 1000 glc 40 ketones. Possible 
etiologies include insulin deficiency (possibly underdosed with 
metformin given repeat HbA1C of 16.6%) or infection with history 
of possible viral prodrome. Low suspicion for cardiac ischemia 
or intoxication triggering DKA given clinical history and 
negative serum/urine tox screen. Anion gap closed with insulin 
drip and patient was subsequently transitioned to subcutaneous 
insulin - she was then transferred from ICU to the regular 
floor. ___ was consulted and patient was started on fixed 
dose as well as meal time insulin prior to discharge. 

# ___ (Creat 1.1 on ___: Presumably prerenal vs ATN in the 
setting of DKA, polyuria, decreased po intake/decreased 
appetite. Renal function improved with IVF. 

# Hypertension: Held home lisinopril 40mg hctz 25mg in the 
setting of ___.
