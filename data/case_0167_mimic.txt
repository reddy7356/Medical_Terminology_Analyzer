Brief Hospital Course:
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: A ___ year old M with HIV who initially 
presented w/ L sided chest pain, found to have a large pleural 
mass w/ workup consistent w/ DLBCL, presenting to initiate C1 of 
da-EPOCH.

ACUTE ISSUES
==================

#DLBCL: He underwent soft tissue mass biopsy ___ which was 
consistent with DLBCL BCL 6 rearrangement, bony involvement in 
setting of acetabulum and thoracic lesions and was admitted for 
his first cycle of chemotherapy. He tolerated his first cycle 
well and today is D+5 of his regimen. He did not receive 
Rituximab during his hospital course, this may likely occur 
during one of this outpatient visits. Per immunohistochemistry, 
his neoplastic cells are immunoreactive for CD45, CD20, and 
PAX5. His last CD4 count was 262 on ___. He will start his 
daily neupogen injections starting ___ in the morning. He 
was started on acyclovir for infectious prophylaxis (400mg BID) 
and was continued on bactrim for PJP PPX. He received IT MTX as 
part of CNS prophylaxis on ___ and appears to be initially 
free of evidence of CNS involvement. His flow cytometry was 
non-diagnostic [per report, cell marker analysis was attempted 
but was non-diagnostic in due to insufficient number of cells 
and as such as clonality could not be assessed]. Dr. ___ will 
assume the role of his primary oncologist. However, in the 
meantime, he will be seen by Dr. ___ on ___ and ___ 
for lab check and provider ___. Dr. ___ ___ 
(___) will be involved in his care [patient has a 
scheduled appointment on ___ at 1:30pm with her team]. Of 
importance, he did not exhibit any evidence of TLS. He was 
continued on allopurinol ___ daily at discharge. His uric acid 
level was normal throughout his hospitalization. 

#Depression and Anxiety: Previously on long-acting wellbutrin 
300mg but given concern for drug-drug interaction with 
chemotherapy, this was discontinued and we discussed with 
psychiatry who agrees with holding medication. Patient reported 
"feelings of sadness" and intermittent tearfulness, so 
re-consulted psych on ___ regarding alternative options. 
Upon discussion with psych, the thought is that his symptoms are 
less likely due to stopping wellbutrin and more likely due to 
coping with lymphoma diagnosis and hospitalization course so 
they recommended not re-starting wellbutrin. Additionally, would 
not recommend starting any other antidepressant at this time as 
patient also would prefer not to do so. Recommended that patient 
be connected to therapy and counseling during this difficult 
time with psych-onc at ___ outpatient. SW consulted and 
following as needed.

#Leukocytosis: Resolved prior to discharge. Without infectious 
symptoms, likely steroid-induced effect. Continue to monitor and 
trend ___ outpatient.

#FVO: Per documentation, weight was up significantly (~16lbs 
from admission weight), however, likely spurious to some degree 
as does not appear to correlate clinically though has mild BLE 
edema. Certainly, his high dose prednisone and continuous IVF he 
received in the context of TLS monitoring may have contributed 
to this. He received 20mg of IV Lasix on ___. Expect 
improvement outpatient. 

CHRONIC CONDITIONS
========================

#HIV: Outpatient team changed home regimen to be chemotherapy 
compatible, currently on descovy and doltegavir per ID 
recommendations. CD4 count improved to 262. Repeat hep markers 
and HiV vL neg

#HTN: Continue home lisinopril at discharge. No acute 
exacerbations in-house.

#HLD: Holding statin while receiving EPOCH. Restarted at 
discharge.

ACUTE ISSUES
-----------------

#Stage IV DLBCL: Recently diagnosed. Underwent soft tissue mass 
biopsy ___ consistent with DLBCL BCL 6 rearrangement. He is 
stage IV involving soft tissues, bones, nodes, adrenal. 
Treatment with curative intent with planned 6 cycles of 
DA-EPOCH- R. He received IT MTX as part of CNS prophylaxis on 
___ and appears to be free of evidence of CNS involvement. 
His flow cytometry was non-diagnostic. He is
intermediate risk for CNS involvement, as he is a stage IV 
disease, adrenal involvement, and extranodal involvement. Plan 
will be for 2 cycles of HD MTX after completion of 6 cycles of 
da R-EPOCH. He was admitted for C2 R-DA-EPOCH. Today is D+5. He 
tolerated his regimen well. Continues on Acyclovir and Bactrim 
for prophylaxis at discharge.  He is without evidence of TLS so 
consider discontinuing allopurinol outpatient. 
Will start Neupogen daily on Day 6 or 7 following chemotherapy 
completion. He has enough neupogen injections that will last 
through this cycle and the next two cycles.  For the time being, 
he will have labs and visits checked with Dr. ___ at ___. 
Scheduled for ___ and ___

#Leukcytosis: Without infectious symptoms, we will continue to 
monitor and trend outpatient as he appears quite well.  This is 
likely steroid effect.  

#HIV: Stable. Currently on descovy and doltegavir per ID  
recommendations. CD4 count last checked on ___ was 145 and 
last HIV viral load negative on ___.

#Depression and Anxiety: Stable. Previously on long-acting 
wellbutrin 300mg but given concern for drug-drug interaction 
with chemotherapy, this was discontinued and discussed with  
psychiatry who agrees with holding medication. Additionally, 
would not recommend starting any other antidepressant at this
time as patient also would prefer not to do so. 

#HTN: Stable. Off lisinopril as pressures were lower during 
outpatient visits with Dr. ___. Normotensive on throughout 
hospital course. 

#HLD: Stable. Holding statin due to drug-drug interactions with 
chemotherapy.

workup.

#Left sided chest pain
#Soft tissue mass
#Pathologic fracture
-soft tissue mass concerning for malignancy evident on CT scan.  
It's ___ are substantial, 4.1X5x5.8cm. 
Final report as follows: 
1. No dissection or acute aortic abnormality. 
2. Acute/subacute posterolateral left fourth rib fracture with 
surrounding 
soft tissue mass concerning for metastasis with pathologic 
fracture.  Biopsy 
of the soft tissue mass should be considered. 
3. 1.2 cm hyperdense soft tissue nodule abutting left psoas 
muscle is 
indeterminate and may represent a peritoneal deposit. 
4. Expansile mixed lytic sclerotic lesion involving the T10 
vertebral body and 
posterior elements is suspicious for metastasis. 
5. Indeterminate 1.9 x 2.5 cm right adrenal nodule.  Adrenal 
metastasis from 
unknown primary cannot be excluded considering aforementioned 
findings. 
6. Retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy. Borderline enlarged right 
external iliac 
lymph node. 
7. Subcentimeter round sclerotic lesions in left seventh rib, 
right iliac bone 
and right acetabulum could represent bone islands or metastatic 
lesions. 
8. Indeterminate hepatic hypodensities, the largest measuring 
1.0 cm and 
favored to represent a cyst or biliary hamartoma.  Attention on 
follow-up 
imaging is recommended. 
9. 1.8 cm splenic round hypodense splenic lesion, possibly a 
hemangioma but 
indeterminate in the setting of metastatic disease elsewhere.  
Attention on 
follow-up imaging is recommended. 
 
-As shown by above findings, most concerning being the soft 
tissue mass and the mixed lytic and sclerotic lesion of the T10 
vertebral body.  I have spoken with both interventional 
pulmonology and interventional radiology.  The interventional 
radiology service is the appropriate speciality to perform a 
biopsy.  Will need tissue sample before referral to any other 
specialist, which will most likely be hematology/oncology.
