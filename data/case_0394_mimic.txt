Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ is ___ with 1.6cm penetrating aortic ulcer with 
pseudoaneurysm. He was scheduled for a TEVAR and left carotid- 
subclavian bypass. He had no complications during the surgery. 
He was transferred from the PACU to the floor. POD1 he had 
hypotension, systolics to the ___. He endorsed lightheadness and 
was confused during these episode. Prior to this episode he 
received his BP meds, which most likely contributed to his 
hypotension. He responded well to multiple boluses of fluids. 
His labs were stable. His UOP was normal. There were no evidence 
of bleeding from his drain site in his neck or groin site. He

POD1 to 24.2 POD2. POD 3 his crit was stable at ___ and he was 
felt to be safe for discharge as this crit drop was  likely in 
the setting of dilution from fluids. There were no signs of 
bleeding as mentioned above. Of note pt's eliquis was held for 
afib and he will restart on ___. He will continue to take 
aspirin. 

HIs home losartan, nifedipine and furosemide were held and will

sites.  This too is normal.  Male patients may notice swelling 
in the scrotum.  The swelling will get better over one-two 
weeks.

sure to report signs of infection.  These include: increasing 
redness; worsening pain; new or increasing drainage, or drainage 
that is white, yellow, or green; or fever of 101.5 or more.  (If

irritating to the groin puncture sites. 
MEDICATIONS

could form in your repaired artery. 
•It is very important that you never stop taking aspirin or 
other blood thinning medicines-even for a short while- unless

constipation, you may talk a mild laxative.   Please take to 
your pharmacist for advice about what to take. 
SMOKING

Discharge Instructions:
Mr ___,
You were transferred from an OSH for further evaluation of your 
chest pain and shortness of breath after imaging showed an 
abnormality in your aorta that was likely responsible for the 
pain. 

Once your blood pressure was lowered with new medications, your 
pain resolved.  We will follow the area of the aorta that was 
noted to have this penetrating aortic ulceration with CT scan 
over time to make sure the area does not change.  There is no 
indication for intervention at this time.  

We have adjusted your BP medications in consultation with he 
vascular medicine team. We have made changes to your 
medications, outlined below.  It is very important that your BP 
not be above 120 systolic.  Please follow up with your PCP early 
next week for BP medication titration.
