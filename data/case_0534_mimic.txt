History of Present Illness:
Ms. ___ is a ___ ___ freshman with no prior 
psychiatric diagnoses, no prior hospitalizations or SA's 
presenting with increasingly intrusive suicidal thoughts with 
stated plan of overdosing on pills in setting of multiple 
psychosocial stressors and overwhelming depressive and anxiety
symptoms.
. 
___ reports increasing anxiety and low self worth upon 
starting school at ___ approximately three weeks ago. She 
states that she has had difficulty transitioning to college and 
being away from home for the first time. Most significantly, 
this includes difficulty meeting new peers and feelings of 
isolation in setting of increasing stress regarding school 
performance. She has
frequent regret regarding her decision to come to ___ and in 
setting of worsening "anxiety" reports daily intrusive suicidal 
thoughts for the past two weeks. She started seeing a counselor 
at ___ (qWeekly) which she notes is 
beneficial short term but notes escalating anxiety despite this. 
Patient reported seeing a therapist at home in ___ during 
her
senior year of HS (biweekly).
. 
This past ___ her friend from home passed away from 
cancer. She reports increasing feelings of guilt that she did 
not reach out to this friend to say goodbye or to say something 
to her friends family. Over the past week she has felt pressure 
from school in setting of upcoming tests. She acknowledges poor 
concentration and reports that she took a practice test and made 
a number of "silly"/stupid mistakes. She states that she doesn't 
feel like she fits in, has had difficulty meeting friends, and 
is overwhelmed by the competitive nature of her program. 
.
Last night she reports the inciting stressor was her boyfriend 
of ___ years called her and spoke about taking a break in their 
relationship. Patient acknowledges that she does feel like a 
break in her relationship is understandable considering the 
distance, but notes that this came at a really tough time for 
her. Last night she felt "out of control" which resulted in
overwhelming emotion and intense suicidal thoughts with plan 
involving thoughts of overdosing on her antihistamine medication 
or her over-the counter anti-anxiety meds. These are the only 
pills she had access to. Patient denied researching how many 
pills or taking out the bottles. She reports that she just 
wanted to be "at peace" and to "not be sick." Per patient, she 
felt like she "hit the breaking point" but noted that she did 
not want to die but that she didn't know what to do. She reports 
that she felt trapped, "out of control" and didn't know how she 
could make herself feel better or what could "help her long 
term." Patient reached out to her mother who spoke with her for 
several hours before she fell asleep. In the morning patient 
emailed her counselor at ___ that she needed to talk with 
her and set up an appointment to meet with one of the on-call 
clinicians in the afternoon because her clinician did not have 
any availability. In the interim the patient attempted to attend 
her morning class which she really enjoys. Despite this, she 
reports she had difficulty motivating herself to go. She states 
that made it to the class but while she was waiting for her 
instructor to show up, her thoughts started to race and she felt 
like she was losing control. She tried to contain her thoughts 
and emotion but became visibly tearful which was apparent to her 
instructor. Her professor saw that she was tearful and walked 
her down to the
counseling center. 
. 
Patient reports ongoing suicidal thoughts in interview at the ED 
but notes that she likely "wouldn't act on it..feel like I would 
regret it. I wouldn't want to that to the people [mom] around 
me." Patient reports that her mood is poor, has a lack of 
motivation, poor energy, feelings of worthlessness and 
hopelessness. Patient reports that sleep is not impaired and 
that she has not been avoiding classes or not getting enjoyment 
from interests (performing and singing). Denies compulsions, 
obsessions, avoidance of interactions with peers. 
. 
Per collateral obtained from her mother at: ___: 
- seeing a counselor before she went to ___, had some 
anxiety issues and then when she got here she was a mess. I know 
that she is very anxious and does not know how to control it. 
Wants to return home. Counselor was telling me earlier and that 
she wants help. Mentioned that she had suicidal thoughts. Per 
Mom patient had a hard time saying goodbye when parents left 
after school.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ is a ___ ___ freshman with no prior 
psychiatric diagnoses, no prior hospitalizations or SA's 
presenting with increasingly intrusive suicidal thoughts with 
stated plan of overdosing on pills in setting of multiple 
psychosocial stressors. 
.
Upon interview, patient reported history of depression and 
anxiety beginning in high school, stating later during her 
admission that her depression'"comes and goes" lasting a day to 
several days. Reported that in the setting of feeling 
overwhelmed with transitioning to school, feeling alone with 
limited supports, the loss of an acquaintance 2 weeks ago from 
cancer, and recent breakup with her boyfriend, she has been 
feeling increasingly depressed and anxious, feeling "out of 
control" with intense emotions, suicidal ideation with patient 
initially reporting plan to overdose on ___ anti-anxiety 
medications. On initial interview, patient also reported low 
mood, poor motivation, poor energy, feelings of hopelessness and 
worthlessness. No history of psychotic or manic symptoms and 
patient denied drug lr alcohol abuse. 
.
Diagnostically, etiology of presentation is unclear; although 
patient likely meets criteria for MDD without psychotic features 
given the above presentation, she endorses prior episodes of 
depression lasting 1 day to several days with improvement of her 
mood, which is not consistent with MDD. No history of mania or 
psychosis, and she was certainly not manic or psychotic on my 
examination-- however, given her young age, certainly this could 
not be ruled out at this time. Given her young age and good 
health, there is very low suspicion of an underlying medical 
illness contributing to her presentation, and no evidence that 
substance use is contributing to her presentation particularly 
given her negative toxicology screen.  Of course, underlying 
character pathology may be emerging, but given her young age I 
would not diagnosed her with a personality disorder at this 
time.
. 
#. Legal/Safety: Patient admitted to ___ for on a ___, upon admission, she signed a conditional voluntary form as 
well as a 3-day notice that expired on day of discharge.  Of 
note, she maintain her safety throughout her hospitalization on 
15-minute checks and did not require physical or chemical 
restraints.  Given her consistent denial of suicidal ideation or 
thoughts of self-harm, thought process that was notably linear, 
goal and future oriented, I do not believe she met criteria to 
file a section 7 and 8B. 
. 
#. Depression/Anxiety: as noted above 
- Patient was compliant and attending groups and maintain good 
behavioral control throughout her hospitalization, was social 
with peers, and compliant in meeting with her treatment team
- After discussion of the risks and benefits, sertraline was 
started at 25 mg p.o. daily and was increased to 50 mg p.o. 
daily.  Of note, the patient tolerated this well with no 
complaints of side effects aside from perhaps slightly loose 
stools.
- For insomnia, patient received Ramelteon 8 mg po qhs prn 
insomnia with good result
-Patient was briefly trialed on low-dose hydroxyzine for 
insomnia and anxiety without significant improvement, and so 
this was discontinued prior to discharge.  
- In the setting of the above medication changes and the 
stabilizing environment of the unit, the patient reported rapid 
improvement in her depression and resolution of her suicidal 
ideation. A family meeting was held prior to discharge with her 
mother, who was supportive of a quick discharge from the 
inpatient unit. 
- Of note, I offered the patient brought to a partial 
hospitalization program, which she declined, stating she would 
prefer to follow-up with outpatient treaters at this time.
