Brief Hospital Course:
This is a ___ year old male with past medical history of 
dementia, CKD 3, glaucoma, admitted w R foot cellulitis, course 
complicated by R ankle pseudogout flare, treated with 
intra-articular steroid injection with subsequent improvement, 
able to be discharged to rehab

# R foot cellulitis
# R foot pain
Patient was admitted with 1 day of redness over R foot and 
ankle.  Given his dementia, he was unable to provide history 
regarding duration of symptoms or whether he had preceding 
trauma.  Xray without acute process.  He was seen by orthopedic 
surgery consult in ED and was noted to have full range of motion 
in ankle without pain.  Exam was felt to be consistent with 
cellulitis.  Patient started on IV vancomycin + cefazolin.  
Erythema and swelling initially improved, but then pain 
worsened, prompting additional workup as below.  De-escalated to 
Keflex and completed 5 days of antibiotics prior to discharge. 

# R ankle psuedogout 
# R ankle pain 
Following initial clinical improvement, patient's course was 
complicated by worsening ankle pain and new pain with active and 
passive motion. Patient was re-seen by orthopedic consult 
service and underwent joint tap, which showed 19k WBCs, 111k 
RBCs, and rhomboid crystals, consistent with pseudogout.  
Patient was seen by rheumatology consult service who, given 
patient's CKD and age, recommended against systemic NSAID and 
steroid treatment.  Recommended initial treatment with pain 
control--per patient's son, he becomes very sedated with any 
pain medications other than Tylenol.  Utilized Tylenol with good 
effect.  After 48 hours of negative cultures, rheumatology 
performed intraarticular steroid injection.  Over subsequent 24 
hours, pain markedly improved.  He was evaluated and recommended 
for discharge to rehab facility. 

# R shoulder pain 
Hospital course also notable for R shoulder pain.  Exam without 
findings to suggest infection or referred neurologic etiology.  
Given he was unable to provide reliable history of events prior 
to his presentation, a plain film was performed to look for 
fracture--no signs of fracture.  Suspected to have benign muscle 
strain on top of
chronic arthritis. Improved with pain control with Tylenol and 
Lidoderm.  

# Glaucoma 
Continued Dorzolamide-Timolol

# Medication intolerance
# Acute metabolic encephalopathy
Following admission, patient received 1 dose of trazodone, and 
subsequently developed sedation.  No new neurologic findings.  
Symptoms resolved after 24 hours.  Suspected to be medication 
intolerance of trazodone.  Added to allergy list.
