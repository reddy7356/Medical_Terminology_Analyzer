Brief Hospital Course:
PATIENT SUMMARY
===============
Mr. ___ is a ___ man with EtOH use disorder, 
alcohol-induced gastritis, and psoriasis who presented to the ED 
with abdominal and chest pain. He was admitted for management of 
___ and alcohol withdrawal. He was treated on CIWA protocol and 
received two doses of diazepam, Zofran for nausea. His 
chest/abdominal pain and nausea resolved and he was able to 
tolerate PO. He was started on acamprosate to reduce cravings 
for alcohol and provided a list of community resources by social 
work. His creatinine remained stable at 1.3 (baseline 1.0-1.1), 
likely pre-renal in the setting of poor PO intake and vomiting, 
a repeat BMP will be scheduled for ___ with PCP ___.

ACUTE ISSUES
============
# EtOH use disorder 
# EtOH withdrawal. 
Maintained on CIWA, received IVF, thiamine. Acamprosate started.

# ___ vs CKD 
Unclear what patient's baseline Cr is, last one on record was 
1.0
in ___. Cr of 1.3 likely represents dehydration iso poor po
intake iso alcohol use. Repeat BMP ___ with PCP followup as 
above.

CHRONIC / RESOLVED ISSUES
=========================
# Anion gap metabolic acidosis. Given normal lactate and pos
urine ketones, likely alcoholic ketoacidosis and non-gap 
acidosis
from vomiting. Compensating appropriately from a respiratory
standpoint. Resolved with IVF and improved PO intake.

# Abdominal Pain. 
No evidence of pancreatitis on CT, neg lipase. LFTs general 
unremarkable outside of elevated AST so unlikely to be 
hepatobiliary in origin. Likely gastritis related to EtOH 
intake. No e/o GIB in history or on exam. Likely secondary to 
alcohol-induced gastritis.

#Psoriasis
Continued Hydrocortisone cream

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES
===================
[ ] Follow up alcohol cravings / EtOH use disorder on 
acamprosate. Would also continue to encourage group therapy, 
etc. as outpatient.

[ ] Follow up creatinine on ___. Unclear if this is his current 
baseline with mild CKD that needs further workup or if just 
pre-renal this admission from dehydration / vomiting.

[ ] Drinking binges seem to be related to episodes of 
"nervousness" and social stress. Continue to encourage 
appropriate coping strategies and consider potential SSRI if it 
seems like there is an aspect of generalized anxiety disorder / 
depression involved.
