Brief Hospital Course:
DISCHARGE SUMMARY

1. LEGAL & SAFETY:  
  On admission, the patient refused to sign a conditional 
voluntary agreement and was admitted on a ___, which 
expired on ___. They were also placed on 15 minute checks 
status on admission and remained on that level of observation 
throughout. Due to stabilization of symptoms and SI, patient was 
able to take part in group walks outside the unit. 

2. PSYCHIATRIC:
This patient presented to the ED following an overdose on 
alcohol, 15 pills of Lexapro 5mg and 15 pills of clonazepam 0.5 
mg. She was unable to be interviewed at this time as she was 
somnolent and had slurred speech. Per collateral from sister, 
patient had multiple stressors building up to this attempt, and 
made a concerning statement to a friend during the night. This 
friend contacted the sister who drove down and found the patient 
in her room surrounded by bottles of alcohol and a knife in the 
bed (which was not used). 

When able to talk coherently, patient corroborated story above. 
Stated that she has had increasing anxiety since moving out of 
parent's home to ___ and breaking up with boyfriend who 
works at the same facility. This caused her to have an initial 
panic attack and admission to the ED to check for medical causes 
of her symptoms. After discharge, she scheduled an appointment 
with her PCP and was prescribed klonopin and Lexapro for her 
anxiety, which helped initially but was not fully effective. She 
continued to have increased anxiety, both from her everyday 
stressors and anxiety about having another panic attack. Alcohol 
use increased significantly during this time period in order to 
cope. Mixed alcohol and benzodiazepines over the weekend that 
took her "to a scary place" which prompted impulsive suicide 
attempt. 

Patient presented on admission with elevated anxiety, intense 
eye contact, and shakiness. Did not report having SI/HI, AVH, 
paranoia, or any symptoms consistent with BPD. 

Our differential diagnosis for this patient included panic 
disorder, MDD, GAD, alcohol use disorder, and adjustment 
disorder. MDD was considered due to SI and insomnia, but was 
ruled less likely due to no report of depressed mood, fatigue, 
loss of energy, anhedonia, loss of appetite, psychomotor 
agitation, or poor concentration. General anxiety disorder was 
considered due to patients report of increased anxiety over the 
past several months. However, patient's anxiety is centered 
around specific relationships/obligations and presents with 
panic attacks - less likely to be GAD. Overall, the patient's 
presentation and history is consistent with panic disorder, 
alcohol use disorder, and adjustment disorder. Patient reports 
having several panic attacks with features including fear of 
dying, shortness of breath, and anxiety about having another 
attack in the future. She also has signs consistent with alcohol 
use disorder, including using alcohol to cope with anxiety, 
binge drinking, and reckless behavior while under the influence. 
Finally, her timeline and general increase in anxiety is 
consistent with adjustment disorder due to her recent move out 
of her parent's home, new job/responsibilities, and break-up 
with significant other at place of work.

This patient was initially started on Lexapro 5 mg QD to help 
cope with here every day anxiety. She was also given hydroxyzine 
BID:PRN for acute treatment. She tolerated both medications well 
without side effects and found hydroxyzine especially useful for 
acute need and assistance with sleep. She also attended multiple 
group sessions during her hospital course in order to help cope 
with various stressors present in her daily life. Levels of 
anxiety decreased significantly from time of admission to 
discharge, lowering from ___ to ___. Patient initially 
downplayed amount of alcohol use over the past months, but 
collateral from father informed team that the problem was much 
more serious. 

Plan was to discharge patient on ___ following family meeting. 
However, father brought up issues surrounding patient's second 
job that caused significant distress and thus was not able to be 
discharged as planned. Needed to spend one extra day to 
restabilize and finalize plans after discharge. Family also 
noted that alcohol use was significantly downplayed by patient - 
plan is to be discharged to ___ at 
___ for 30 day rehabilitation program. 

Report was made to ___ Office on ___ at 16:10. Spoke 
to ___ at ___. No written report was requested.

3. SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS:
  #) Alcohol use disorder
Patient states that she will try sobriety after her discharge, 
but was more hesitant about trying formal abstinent programs, 
including SMART recovery, 12 step, or AA. Initially against 
using MAT, but decided to try after understanding severity of 
disorder and potential consequences. Given 25 mg Naltrexone and 
script for 50 mg upon discharge. 

4. MEDICAL

5. PSYCHOSOCIAL

groups and milieu therapy opportunities offered by the unit. The

Collateral from Father:
He is very worried about the patient's alcohol use.  He states
that she is drinking every day, goes to work intoxicated.  He
says that the probation at the fitness to do is related to her
alcohol use disorder.  He states that she has changed over the
last few years, her physique, is more bloated.  It became clear
that the patient is minimizing her drinking and that her family
does not know what to do about this.  He also wanted to share
something about this relationship the patient has been in.

INFORMED CONSENT: The team discussed the indications for, 
intended benefits of, and possible side effects and risks of 
starting naltrexone and lexapro, and risks and benefits of 
possible alternatives, including not taking the medication, with 
this patient. We discussed the patient's right to decide whether 
to take this medication as well as the importance of the 
patient's actively participating in the treatment and discussing 
any questions about medications with the treatment team. The 
patient appeared able to understand and consented to begin the 
medication.

RISK ASSESSMENT & PROGNOSIS

  On presentation, the patient was evaluated and felt to be at 
an increased risk of harm to herself and/or others based upon 
her suicide attempt.  Their static factors noted at that time 
include history of suicide attempts, Caucasian race, loss of 
relationship, The modifiable risk factors include active 
substance misuse, lack no establishment of outpatient treatment, 
limited coping skills, anxiety,and age. These were addressed 
through MAT for alcohol misuse, coordination of outpatient 
providers, group therapy for coping skills, and Lexapro for 
anxiety management. The patient is being discharged with many 
protective risk factors, including help-seeking nature, future 
oriented viewpoint, lack of active suicidal ideation, and strong 
social support. Overall, based on the totality of our assessment 
at this time, the patient is not at an acutely elevated risk of 
self-harm nor danger to others.
