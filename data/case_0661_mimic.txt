History of Present Illness:
Mr. ___ is a ___ year old right handed man with a history of
coronary artery disease status post myocardial infarction in
___ who presents today after having multiple transient 
episodes
of unresponsiveness with posturing.  

Per the patient and his son-in-law, the patient was riding as a
passenger with his daughter earlier today.  He was in his usual
state of health with no recent illnesses, trauma, or sick
contacts. His daughter and noted the patient suddenly became
unresponsive with his right arm raising up, his head arching
back, his eyes rolled back, and his lids fluttering.  This
episode persisted for 45 seconds, with spontaneous resolution.
The patient noted prior to this event a sensation of a "rising
wave" in his body.  After the event he reported no confusion or
fatigue, however his daughter notes some yawning and fatigue 
gait
follow.  Per the patient, the "rising wave" sensation occurred a
number of times throughout the day, including a one event where
the patient had been driving on the Mass Pike at 70+ miles per
hour without any loss of consciousness.  Because the patient's
daughter has a child with seizures, she immediately arranged for
her father to be taken to ___ ED for further evaluation.

Of note, this is not the first time the patient has experienced
the rising wave sensation which he reports today, nor is it his
first loss of consciousness. Six months ago, Mr. ___ 
describes
an event in which he lost consciousness for a minute or 2. He
friends who are around him were not able to arouse him
immediately, however it did not note anything to him such as
convulsive or tonic posturing. The patient did not have any
antecedent advance occurring prior to this episode. He also 
notes
an event 3 months prior to presentation today in which he
attended a evening class. During the class he felt sensation on
rising weight lasting for only a few seconds and subsequently
lost consciousness for one or 2 minutes. Again, none of the 
class
participants reported any convulsive activity or tonic 
posturing.

The patient presented to his primary care doctor for evaluation
of these episodes. The physician was concerned enough that some
sleep disorder such as sleep apnea may be the underlying cause 
of
these events, and as such, referred him to a sleep study which 
is
scheduled for ___.

On neuro ROS, the pt denies headache, loss of vision, blurred
vision, diplopia, dysarthria, dysphagia, lightheadedness,
vertigo, tinnitus or hearing difficulty. Denies difficulties
producing or comprehending speech.  Denies focal weakness,
numbness, parasthesiae. No bowel or bladder incontinence or
retention. Denies difficulty with gait.
 
On general review of systems, the pt denies recent fever or
chills.  No night sweats or recent weight loss or gain. Denies
cough, shortness of breath.  Denies chest pain or tightness,
palpitations.  Denies nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation 
or
abdominal pain.  No recent change in bowel or bladder habits.  
No
dysuria.  Denies arthralgias or myalgias. Denies rash.

noted.  Pt. had significant difficulty naming both high and low
frequency objects.  Able to read without difficulty.  Speech was
dysarthric for labial sounds.  Able to follow both midline and
appendicular commands.  Attentive, with good knowledge of 
current
events which was confounded by word finding deficit.  There was
no evidence of apraxia or neglect.

-Cranial Nerves:
I: Olfaction not tested.
II: PERRL 4 to 2mm, both directly and consentually; brisk
bilaterally.  VFF to confrontation. Funduscopic exam revealed no
papilledema, exudates, or hemorrhages.
III, IV, VI: EOMI without nystagmus.  Normal saccades.
V: Facial sensation intact to light touch but patient noted
trivial greater sensation in the right face versus the left in
V1/V2 distributions; pinprick/temperature were symmetric in all
distributions, and ___ strength noted bilateral in masseter
VII: Left facial droop noted with decreased activation of the
left mouth, facial musculature on direct confrontation testing
was symmetric and ___ strength in upper and lower distributions,
bilaterally 
VIII: Hearing intact to finger-rub bilaterally.
IX, X: Palate elevates symmetrically.
XI: ___ strength in trapezii and SCM bilaterally.
XII: Tongue protrudes in midline, and is equal ___ strength
bilaterally as evidenced by tongue-in-cheek testing.
 
-Motor: Normal bulk, tone throughout. No pronator drift
bilaterally. No adventitious movements, such as tremor, noted. 
No
asterixis noted.

Brief Hospital Course:
This is a ___ right hand dominant man with multiple 
cardiovascular risk factors who presented with multiple episodes 
of vague body sensations beginning six months ago that 
occasionally result in loss of consciousness, including one 
episode with tonic posturing concerning for seizure activity. He 
was neurologically nonfocoal on examination except for mildly 
increased tone in right lower extremity. Based on description of 
events, he was most likely experiencing simple partial seizures 
with a possible temporal lobe focus. These episodes 
occassionally become complex such as the event witnessed by his 
daughter with right arm raising and eye fluttering for 45 
seconds. 

The cause of his ictal events was not known. Head CT was 
unremarkable for any tumor, bleed, or other precipitating 
lesion. MRI showed one tiny focal lesion on the right and small 
vessel disease. Infection was unlikely given the six month 
duration of events. Sodium was mildly low (131) upon admission; 
however this spontaneously improved and a sodium of 131 would 
not be sufficiently low to result in seizure activity. 

Upon admission the patient was continued on his home 
medications, placed on LTM EEG, and began Keppra 500 mg BID. LTM 
EEG showed no definite epileptiform discharges or electrographic 
seizures. Neurological exam was trended and the patient showed 
no changes in neurological status during his stay. The patient 
was instructed on taking Keppra at home and he was also told not 
to drive for six months, and he expressed understanding and 
acceptance of this.
