Stress Test ___ (___): No e/o myocardial ischemia.  Similar 
to prior.

CXR ___:
Mild right lung base opacity is likely atelectasis, although 
pneumonia is possible in correct clinical setting.

 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ CAD s/p recent CABG and PCI, CHF, COPD, HTN p/w diarrhea, 
fever, malaise, decreased PO intake, and hyponatremia.

==ACTIVE ISSUES==

# Hyponatremia: The pt had a sodium level of 122 on admission. 
The etiology was felt to be hypovolemic hyponatremia ___ poor PO 
intake for four days prior to presentation, as it had been on 
previous admissions. Low FENa and compressible IVC on u/s were 
also suggestive of this. He had diarrhea which could have caused 
GI sodium loss. As his hospitalization progressed, his sodium 
became suggestive of underlying SIADH. Suspicions were raised 
when his sodium improved with fluid restriction. This could have 
been possible due to his GI infection, stress due to poor PO 
intake, and/or the presence of a pulmonary nodule which was not 
evaluated further during this admission. Given that a potential 
cause of his SIADH could be his pramipexole, his home dose of 
0.5 mg BID was reduced to 0.25 mg BID. 

# Diarrhea: The pt presented with several days of diarrhea and 
poor PO intake that made a viral gastroenteritis likely. He was 
started on PO flagyl for possibility of C. diff, but test 
returned negative so his flagyl was d/c'ed. 

==CHRONIC ISSUES==

# CAD/CABG: The pt was continued on ASA81, plavix, atorvastatin, 
and carvedilol. 

# chronic diastolic CHF: The pt's furosemide was held given 
volume depletion and hyponatremia. He was not restarted on this 
medication. 

# HTN: the pt was continued on his home carvedilol. His losartan 
was initially held, and on day of discharge he was restarted at 
a reduced dose of 12.5 mg. 

# COPD: the pt was continued on Advair, tiotropium, and 
albuterol PRN.

# BPH: the pt was continued on tamsulosin

***Transitional issues***: 
- Pt was found on chest CT in ___ to have a pulmonary nodule 
approx 7 mm in size. He should have follow up chest CT on this 
nodule in ___. 
- The pt's home lasix and losartan were initially held; he was 
restarted on a reduced dose of losartan 12.5 mg daily on day of 
discharge. He should discuss whether he needs to continue lasix 
with his PCP. 
- The pt was found to have continued leukopenia to 2.___s mild monocytosis during his stay. This had been noted on 
previous admissions as well a few months ago. He should have 
hematology f/u in the outpatient setting with consideration of 
bone marrow biopsy. 
- The pt should have colonoscopy given his microcytic anemia, as 
well as iron studies. 
- The pt's home dose of pramipexole 0.5 mg BID was reduced to 
0.25 mg BID due to concern that it might be causing SIADH. 
- The pt should have labwork in 3 days (___) to evaluate his 
creatinine and iron studies and CBC.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,

It was a pleasure caring for you at ___.  You presented with 
diarrhea, decresed food intake, and not feeling well.  You also 
had a low sodium level.  This was felt to be due to being 
dehydrated and a side effect of the pramipexole, the dose of 
which we have reduced. You also should avoid drinking more than 
2L of fluid in a day. Your diarrhea resolved in the hospital and 
your sodium improved.  Please be sure to go to your follow up 
appointments as scheduled.  

Your pramipexole dose was reduced due to concern that it could 
be causing your sodium level to become low. Please discuss the 
new dose with your primary care doctor. 

The are a number of studies and tests that we will recommend to 
your PCP that should be done in the coming months. These include 
lab work to evaluate for the cause of your anemia, a 
colonoscopy, and a repeat chest CT to monitor the nodule that 
was seen in ___.

We have not restarted your lasix due to its potential effects on 
sodium levels. Please discuss with your PCP about when to 
restart this medication.

Thank you for allowing us to participate in your care. 

Sincerely,

Your ___ Team

Conclusions  
Prebypass

No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. 

Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left 
ventricular cavity size is top normal/borderline dilated. There 
is severe regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with 
all levels of septal wall. Overall left ventricular systolic 
function is severely depressed (LVEF= 15 %). [Intrinsic left 
ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the 
severity of valvular regurgitation.] 

Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. 

The diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels 
are normal. The descending thoracic aorta is mildly dilated. 
There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the descending thoracic 
aorta. 

The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with 
good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic 
regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. 
Mild to moderate (___) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is 
no pericardial effusion. 

Dr. ___ was notified in person of the results in the OR 
during the procedure.

Post CPB

The patient separated from bypass with phenylephrine and 
epinephrine by IV infusions. Cardiac Output is 5.9 LPM by TEE. 

The LVEF has impoved to ___ though this is on epi drip. The 
septum has improved from akinetic to hypokinetic. The mitral 
regurgitation is moderate. There is no sign of aortic injury or 
dissection.   
   I certify that I was present for this procedure in compliance 
with ___ regulations.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was brought to the Operating Room on ___ where 
the patient underwent CABG x 5 with Dr. ___.  Overall the 
patient tolerated the procedure well and post-operatively was 
transferred to the ___ in stable condition for recovery and 
invasive monitoring.  
The patient does have a history of alcohol dependence. He was 
agitated with initial wean and required precedex.  CIWA scale 
was implemented.  He was extubated on POD 1 and maintained on 
the CIWA scale.  He was weaned from epi and neo by POD 1.  The 
patient was neurologically intact and hemodynamically stable.  
Beta blocker was initiated and the patient was gently diuresed 
toward the preoperative weight.  The patient was transferred to 
the telemetry floor for further recovery.  Chest tubes and 
pacing wires were discontinued without complication.  The 
patient was evaluated by the physical therapy service for 
assistance with strength and mobility.  He failed a void trial.  
Foley was replaced and Flomax started.  Void trial should be 
repeated in 3 days at rehab.   By the time of discharge on POD 4 
the patient was ambulating freely, the wound was healing and 
pain was controlled with oral analgesics.  The patient was 
discharged to ___ on the ___ in good condition with 
appropriate follow up instructions.

pulmonary edema has worsened. Bibasilar opacities consistent 
with atelectasis left greater than right have increased.  
Presumed bilateral pleural effusions are small.  Calcified 
mediastinal lymph nodes are again noted. 

ECG ___ 8:30am): New t-wave inversions in leads V1-V6 with 
t-wave flattening in leads I, II, aVL. 

ECHO (___): 
The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall 
thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is 
normal. There is moderate to severe global left ventricular 
hypokinesis with regional variation; inferior wall, posterior 
wall, and apex are severely hypokinetic (LVEF = 30 %). The right 
ventricular free wall thickness is normal. Right ventricular 
chamber size is normal. with borderline normal free wall 
function. There are focal calcifications in the aortic arch. The 
number of aortic valve leaflets cannot be determined. The aortic 
valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is 
not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve 
leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate (2+) mitral 
regurgitation is seen. There is a small to moderate sized 
pericardial effusion. The effusion appears circumferential. 
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ w/ CAD s/p CABG (___), sCHF (EF ___, presenting with 
nausea, malaise, found to have severe sepsis with unknown source 
and worsening LVEF and progressive RCA stenosis requiring bare 
metal stenting (___).

# Severe sepsis: The patient was transferred to the ___ from 
OSH for management of sepsis and hyponatremia. He presented with 
fevers, chills, malaise, confusion, poor PO intake, nausea, and 
vomiting for 4 days prior to arrival. On arrival he was found to 
be febrile to 101, leukopenic to 3.7 (dropping to 1.8) and 
hyponatremic to 125. CXR and UA were unremarkable. On HD1 he 
became tachycardic to the 160s tachypnic to ___ and O2 sats were 
70%  on the floor. He was found to be rigoring, diaphoretic, and 
confused. CXR showed LLL retrocardiac atelectasis but no 
consolidation. EKG showed sinus tachycardia. It was noted that 
he was receiving vancomycin but had not received cefepime. He 
was given vancomycin, cefepime, demerol, tylenol, and 2L IVF. He 
remained on Vancomycin and Cefepime from ___. He remained 
afebrile for 72 hours and antibiotics were discontinued. The 
symptoms of malaise, confusion, and nausea improved. His 
hyponatremia improved over the course of the admission with IVF 
and improved PO intake. His leukopenia has overall been 
improving with some fluctations. Urine and blood cultures were 
negative. He remained afebrile for over 48 hours after 
antibiotics.

#CAD: On HD3, it was noted that he was short of breath, 
diaphoretic, and was complaining of substernal chest pain. He 
described the pain as pleuritic and located at the sternal 
incision site. An EKG showed T-wave inversions in leads V1-V6 
with some T-wave flattening in I and II compared to prior. 
Repeat EKG showed deeping of the T-wave inversions. Trops were 
negative x2. A CXR showed mild worsening of pulmonary edema. His 
SOB improved after lasix 20mg x 2. An Echo showed inferior wall, 
posterior wall, and apex as severely hypokinetic (LVEF = 30 %). 
Cardiology was consulted and it was decided that catheterization 
was appropriate in the setting of ongoing EKG changes and echo 
findings despite the atypical nature of his pain. 
Catheterization showed 80% stenosis of the RCA requiring BMS. He 
had one episode of shortness of breath on HD4. Repeat EKG showed 
no changes. Initial troponin was positive but serial was 
negative. He is on medically optimized therapy with aspirin, 
losartan, clopidogrel (for a 1 month course started on ___, 
atorvastatin, and carvedilol. 

#Hyponatremia: The patient had hypovolemic hyponatremia in the 
setting of poor PO intake over last several days. His mental 
status changes were more likely attributable to worsening 
sepsis. Improved with fluid resuscitation and PO intake. 

#COPD: Was managed with Fluticasone-Salmeterol Diskus (250/50) 1 
INH IH BID, Tiotropium Bromide 1 CAP IH DAILY ,

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,

You were admitted to the ___ 
in the setting of fevers, fatigue, chills, and nausea. On 
arrival you were found to be having shakes, high fevers, and low 
blood pressures. You were stabilized with antibiotics and IV 
fluids. Your condition improved over the course of the next ___ 
hours. We continued you on the antibiotics for 4 days and 
discontinued them after you were asymptomatic and not having 
fevers. We did search for a source of your infection but all of 
our laboratory results did not reveal a cause. It is possible 
that you had a transient infection that spread to your blood and 
this was thus completely treated by the antibiotics that you 
were on.

Additionally, during this hospital stay you developed shortness 
of breath and chest pain. We did an ultrasound of your heart 
which revealed possible injury. Cardiology became involved in 
your care and thought it would be best to get a catheretization 
image of your heart. This procedure revealed a blockage in a 
heart vessel that required a stent placement. We monitored your 
heart for a few days after the procedure and you were stable. 

It is important that you follow up with your primary care 
physician and with cardiology. Please weigh yourself every 
morning, call MD if weight goes up more than 3 lbs.

It was a pleasure to take care of you. We wish you the very 
best!

Sincerely, 

Your ___ care team

Pertinent Results:
IMAGING:

___: CT Abdomen/Pelvis:
1. Redemonstration of several ruptured right renal cysts with 
adjacent 
perinephric stranding and fluid.  No evidence of renal 
laceration or contrast extravasation.  No evidence of pelvic 
free fluid. 
2. Redemonstration of a small subcutaneous hematoma in the 
posterior right 
pelvis. 
3. Minimally displaced avulsion fracture of the greater 
trochanter of the 
right femur. 
4. Compared to ___, unchanged size and appearance of a 
high-density 2 cm renal cyst at the inferior pole the right 
kidney, likely a proteinaceous or hemorrhagic cyst, although if 
further investigation is warranted, can consider renal 
ultrasound.

bronchi. 

___: B/L wrist x-rays:
No acute fracture or dislocation involving either elbow, 
forearm, or wrist.

___: Left Knee x-ray:
  
Moderate lipohemarthrosis is concerning for an intra-articular 
fracture, 
though no discrete fracture line is visualized.  CT of the knee 
is suggested for further assessment.  No dislocation. 

___: B/L Forearm x-ray:
No acute fracture or dislocation involving either elbow, 
forearm, or wrist.

___: CXR:
No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary process.  Specifically, no 
pneumothorax or displaced rib fracture.  Stable changes of COPD.

Brief Hospital Course:
___ male with h/o HTN, HLD, asthma/COPD, atrial 
fibrillation (not on anticoagulation)and CAD presented to the ED 
s/p MVA. He was initially taken to ___ where he started 
complaining of pain in the right hip and left knee pain. He had 
CT and XR imaging that identified a ruptured left renal cyst as 
well as a greater trochanter fracture of the right hip, and was 
transferred to ___ for further evaluation.  The patient was 
admitted the Trauma/Acute Care Surgery service for care. The 
Orthopedic Surgery service was consulted for the right greater 
trochanter fracture and non-operative management was recommended 
and the patient could bear weight as tolerated on the RLE.  A 
left knee x-ray was obtained, due to left knee pain, which was 
equivocal for left tibeal plateau fracture, and a CT LLE 
confirmed he had a left tibeal plateau fracture.  

While in the hospital, the patient had urinary retention and was 
straight catheterized x 1.  He voided adequately afterwards on 
his own. 

There was nothing to do for the right renal cyst rupture except 
pain management.  The patient received tramadol, ibuprofen, 
acetaminophen and lidocaine patches for pain control.  The 
patient worked with physical and occupational therapy and he was 
cleared to be discharged home to continue his recovery.

At the time of discharge, the patient was doing well, afebrile 
with stable vital signs. The patient was tolerating a regular 
diet, ambulating, voiding without assistance, and pain was well 
controlled.  The patient was discharged home without services. 
The patient received discharge teaching and follow-up 
instructions with understanding verbalized and agreement with 
the discharge plan.
