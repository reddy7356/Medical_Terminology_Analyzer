___ Transthoracic ECHO:
The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall 
thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic function are 
normal (LVEF 60-70%). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests a normal 
left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg). There is no 
ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size and 
free wall motion are normal. There are focal calcifications in 
the aortic arch. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly 
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic 
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly 
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Trivial mitral 
regurgitation is seen. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic 
pressure is normal. There is no pericardial effusion.  
___ Intraop TEE:
PRE BYPASS The left atrium is mildly dilated. No spontaneous 
echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the left 
atrium/left atrial appendage or the body of the right 
atrium/right atrial appendage. No atrial septal defect is seen 
by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity 
size and regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF 
>55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are 
normal. There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic 
aorta. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal 
with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis. No aortic 
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly 
thickened. Physiologic mitral regurgitation is seen (within 
normal limits). There is no pericardial effusion. Dr. ___ 
was notified in person of the results in the operating room at 
the time of the study. POST BYPASS Normal biventricular systolic 
function. Thoracic aorta intact. No changes from pre-bypass 
study.

Final Report 
CLINICAL HISTORY: Status post removal of left chest tube. 
CHEST: 
Mediastinal chest tubes, endotracheal tube and nasogastric tube 
have all been removed. Some atelectasis is present at the left 
base. No pneumothorax is identified. There are low lung volumes. 

Air-filled loops of large and small bowel are seen. There is no 
free air 
under either hemidiaphragm. 
IMPRESSION: Tubes removed. No pneumothorax.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ was admitted to the cardiac surgical service and 
underwent routine preoperative evaluation. Workup was rather 
unremarkable and he was cleared for surgery. Given his inpatient 
stay was greater than 24 hours prior to surgery, Vancomycin was 
used for perioperative coverage.

On ___, Dr. ___ coronary artery bypass 
grafting surgery. For surgical details, please see seperate 
dictated operative note. Following the operation, he was brought 
to the CVICU in stable condition for invasive monitoring. Within 
24 hours, he awoke neurologically intact and was extubated 
without incident. Given postoperative anemia, he was transfused 
with packed red blood cells to maintain hematocrit near 30%. He 
otherwise maintained stable hemodynamics and transferred to the 
SDU on postoperative day one. On postoperative day two, he 
experienced atrial fibrillation which was initially treated with 
beta blockade and Amiodarone.  He converted back to a normal 
sinus rhythm within 24 hours. The remainder of his hospital stay 
was uneventful, his activity level was gradually advanced and on 
POD4 he was discharged home. He has follow up in 1 week at ___ 
___.
