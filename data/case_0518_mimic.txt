unspecified 
  
Sinus rhythm with low amplitude P waves. Low limb lead voltage. 
Compared to the previous tracing of ___ sinus rhythm has 
reappeared.  

___: Right hip x-ray:
Right total hip arthroplasty is anatomically aligned.  One of 
the 2 orthopedic screws in the region of the greater trochanter 
is not anchored within the bone. 

___: EKG:
Sinus tachycardia with recent paroxysm of supraventricular 
tachycardia 
recorded in the first two QRS complexes, similar to that of 
___ previous. Sinus rhythm has reappeared. There is diffuse 
low voltage. Followup and clinical correlation are suggested. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ is a ___ year old female who underwent right total hip 
replacement on ___ and was started on Coumadin to prevent 
DVT/PE.  She was discharged and then represented to ___ 
___ from her SNF with 3 days of abdominal pain and 
nausea/vomiting. She was transferred to ___ after OSH CT 
demonstrated evidence of cholecystitis.  In the ED, she received 
Zosyn and INR was 2.5. ACS was consulted to evaluate patient for 
possible cholecystectomy.  As the patient reported right hip 
pain, Orthopaedics was consulted to evaluate septic hip from the 
R THA the area and there was no sign of infection.  The patient 
was admitted to the ACS service with plans for cholecystectomy.

On HD1, the patient was restricted from eating and was started 
on IVF for hydration.  The patient received IV unasyn.  On HD2, 
the patient received FFP for INR reversal and she was taken to 
the operating room and underwent laparoscopic cholecystectomy.  
A RUQ JP drain was placed and drainage color and amount was 
recorded (JP was removed on ___.  The patient tolerated 
the procedure well (reader, please see operative note for 
details).  After remaining hemodynamically stable in the PACU, 
the patient was transferred to the surgical floor for further 
management.

On POD #1, the patient was triggered for atrial fibrillation 
with rvr.  She received 5mg IV metoprolol x3 which controlled 
the heart rate. She was started on her home medications and was 
triggered later that day for bursts of SVT to the 160s. She was 
asymptomatic and received 2 doses IV metoprolol which reduced 
her heart rate to the low 100s.  Metoprolol was increased to 25 
mg PO BID.  Cardiology was consulted to help manage the 
patient's heart arrhythmia and the patient was started on 25 mg 
metoprolol q6H. The patient was later straight catheterized for 
urine retention. Her foley was replaced.  The patient's foley 
catheter was later removed and the patient voided, however 
retained >500ccs on bladder scan.  The foley catheter was 
replaced and Flomax was ordered.  On ___, the patient was 
restarted on Coumadin at 2mg and INR was monitored.  

The patient worked with physical therapy and it was recommended 
she be discharged to rehab to continue her recovery. The patient 
remained alert and oriented throughout hospitalization; pain was 
managed with acetaminophen and oxycodone prn. The patient 
remained stable from a pulmonary standpoint; vital signs were 
routinely monitored. Good pulmonary toilet, early ambulation and 
incentive spirometry were encouraged throughout hospitalization. 
The patient was advanced to a regular diet which was well 
tolerated. Patient's intake and output were closely monitored.  
The patient's fever curves were closely watched for signs of 
infection, of which there were none.  Right hip staples were 
removed on ___. The patient's blood counts were closely 
watched for signs of bleeding, of which there were none. The 
patient received subcutaneous heparin and ___ dyne boots were 
used during this stay and was encouraged to get up and ambulate 
as early as possible.

At the time of discharge, the patient was doing well, afebrile 
and hemodynamically stable.  The patient was tolerating a diet, 
voiding without assistance, and pain was well controlled.  The 
patient received discharge teaching and follow-up instructions 
with understanding verbalized and agreement with the discharge 
plan.

were seen by the Cardiology service.  You were started on a 
medication called, Metoprolol, to help control your heart rate.  
Please follow-up with your outpatient Cardiologist.  

Your hip staples were removed and you have been restarted on 
Coumadin to prevent blood clots.  Please follow-up with your
