History of Present Illness:
The patient is a ___ year old male with schizophrenia and 
___ disease who presents with 2 days of reported 
difficulty swallowing and increasingly slurred speech.  He 
states that he has been unable to swallow pills for the last 2 
days because of his swallowing difficulties, and has not been

IMAGING / STUDIES:
# CHEST (PORTABLE AP) ___ at 1:13 ___:
The patient is status post median sternotomy.  The heart size is 
top normal. The aorta remains tortuous.  There is mild pulmonary 
vascular congestion. Persistent bibasilar parenchymal opacities 
are re- demonstrated, possibly reflecting chronic aspiration or 
infection.  No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is 
present.  No acute osseous abnormalities are demonstrated.
IMPRESSION: Chronic bibasilar airspace opacities concerning for 
recurrent aspiration or infection.

 
Brief Hospital Course:
The patient is a ___ year old male with ___ disease and 
schizophrenia who was admitted with worsening ___ 
symptoms and cough.

# ___ disease: He presented with worsening symptoms, in 
particular his speech and swallowing.  During the two dayts 
before admission, he was unable to take his ___ or 
schizophrenia medications.  Per neurology, his physical exam was 
overall similar to that documented in the outpatient setting, so 
was likely not too far from his recent baseline.  Given his 
initial cough, his symptoms likely worsened from the stress of 
an upper respiratory infection or perhaps an aspiration event.  
He was initially started on Parcopa SL disintegrating tablets 
instead of Sinement and Benztropine IM, with some improvement in 
his symptoms.  He was eventually able to take oral medications 
crushed with thickened liquids.  He was likely close to baseline 
at the time of discharge.

# Cough and Leukocytosis:  This was thought to be either 
aspiration pneumonitis vs pneumonia given his infiltrates on 
CXR.  He was treated with Levofloxacin, but his symptoms and 
labs quickly improved, making pneumonitis or viral URI more 
likely.  Antibiotics were stopped.  Influenza DFA swab was 
negative.
 
# Dysphagia / Aspiration: The patient has difficutly swallowing 
at baseline, which likely worsened in the setting of an acute 
stress.  He uses thickened liquids and boost for nutrition, and 
has declined feeding tubes for nutrition in the past.  He was 
transitioned back to his prior diet.  The possibility of a 
feeding tube was discussed, but not pursued at this time.  He 
was evaluated by Speech and Swallow, who felt that he was at 
risk for aspiration, but similar to prior exams.  It was 
recommended that if willing to accept some risk for intermittent 
aspiration, he could continue on his previous diet of 
nectar-thick liquids and pureed solids with 1:1 supervision and 
aspiration precautions.

# Schizophrenia: He was not acutely decompensated during his 
admission despite missing several days of medication.  Once able 
to have limited PO intake, he was restarted on Clozapine.  Since 
he was off it for several days, the Clozapine was restarted at a 
lower dose and slowly uptitrated, with monitoring of his CBC.  
His other psychiatric medications were restarted once able.  He 
will need further increases in his Clozapine back to his prior 
home dose after discharge.  This should be done in conjunction 
with psychiatry recommendations.

# Crohn's disease: Currently in remission.  Per outpatient 
records, patient refuses to taper Prednisone.  He was given 
Methylprednisolone IV instead of Prednisone PO while NPO.  He 
was continued on Metronidazole.

# GERD: Chronic issue, not active during this admission.  He was 
given Lansoprazole instead of Omeprazole given his difficulties 
with swallowing.
