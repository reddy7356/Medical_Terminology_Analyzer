___ CT Head:
Extensive white matter edema in the posterior aspect of the 
right
frontal lobe which extends medially to the level of the basal
ganglia. There is a small low attenuation extra-axial fluid
collection lateral to the right frontal lobe which measures 4 mm
in diameter. There is low attenuation in the lateral aspect of
the right temporal lobe compatible with encephalomalacia. There
is also extensive subcortical white matter edema in the 
posterior
aspect of the right frontal lobe. The white matter edema in the
right frontal lobe causes mild mass effect on the frontal horn 
of
the right lateral ventricle and creates slight shift of the
midline to the left by approximately 3 mm. No evidence of
hemorrhage.

MRI HEAD W & W/O: ___
1. Findings compatible with extracranial right frontoparietal 
abscess in the surgical bed which likely extends through the

pachymeningeal enhancement as well as more focal leptomeningeal 
enhancement involving the posterior right frontal, parietal and 
superior temporal lobes. Cerebral edema underlying the 
pachymeningeal enhancement is compatible with 
meningoencephalitis/cerebritis. 
3. The edema results in 4 mm leftward midline shift as well as 
effacement of the right lateral ventricle without subfalcine or 
uncal herniation at the time exam. 
4. There is no evidence of acute infarct. 
5. The dural venous sinuses are patent. 
6. At the time of this dictation, the patient was already

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ was transferred from an OSH on the night of ___ with 
increased left hand weakness. He was noted to have drainage from 
his previous right crani incision. He was transferred to the 
neurosurgical floor for further monitoring and planning. Blood 
cultures were obtained and sent. The pt is afebrile and his wbc 
is 5. He was started on Vanco and Ceftriaxone. He was made NPO 
for possible OR tomorrow. 

On ___, the patient remained neurologically stable. He 
continued with drainage from his incision. He continued on Vanco 
but the ceftriaxone was changed to Cefepime for pseudomonas 
coverage. His INR was 3.7 and a cardiology consult was obtained 
to for recommendations on reversal of his INR, in order to 
operated on the patient today for a wound washout. However, they 
recommended to consult hematology for recs. Hematology was 
consulted and they recommended 4 units of FFP and 5 mg of 
Vitamin K. His INR was repeated and was 1.7. Both teams 
expressed their concerns of the risk for stroke with reversal of 
INR due to his mechanical valve, and both teams recommend to 
start anticoagulation with heparin, no bolus as soon as 
possible. An MRI of the head was obtained and showed abscess 
with concenrs of empyema in the surgical bed along with 
pachymeningeal enhancement which is compatible with 
meningoencephalitis/cerebritis. Due to the extension of the 
infection, infectious disease was consulted for continued 
management with antibiotics. ID will see the patient tomorrow. 

On ___, the patient's neurologic examination remained stable. 
ID were consulted. Cultures obtained from the OR showed no 
growth to date. He remained on Vancomycin and Cefepime. Drain 
output was minimal. 

On ___, the patient's neurologic examination remained stable. 
The patient was continued on Vancomycin and Cefepime per ID 
recommendations. All 3 wound cultures grew out staph aureus, 
sensitivites pending. Drain output was minimal and was d/c'ed. 
Repeat head CT was performed and was stable. ___ were 
consulted. On ___ his Vancomycin trough was 9.9 and his dose 
was increased to 1500mg Q8hrs. A Heparin drip was also started 
with a PTT goal of 60-80. He remained neurologically stable on 
exam. 

Mr. ___ was consented and a PICC line placed in the right 
upper extremity with confirmed placement on ___. ID 
following for wound infection and recommend continue Vancomycin 
1500mg IV Q8H and will follow trough level for goal ___. 

On ___, Mr. ___ was seen by the Speech/Language pathologist 
due to concerns of difficulty swallowing.  He had no issues 
during their evaluation and was kept on a regular diet with thin 
liquids.  His Vanco trough was 29, so his dosing was decreased 
to 1250mg IV q 8 hours with a trough pending prior to his next 
dose. 

Mr. ___ wound culture final results grew staph aureus  
coagulase positive; and based upon sensitivity and ID 
recommendations, the Vancomycin was discontinued and he started 
on Cefazolin on ___.  Mr. ___ continued on heparin 
infusion anticoaglation for a goal PTT 60-80, and Coumadin 5mg 
daily was initiated the evening of ___. Mr. ___ was 
evaluated by Physical Therapy with the recommendations of acute

Cranioplasty for Wound Washout

•*** You underwent a surgery called a craniectomy for wound 
washout due to wound infection. A portion of your skull was 
removed to clean out your wound and to treat your bone flap with 
antibiotics. You must wear a helmet when out of bed at all 
times.
•Please keep your sutures and staples along your incision dry 
until they are removed.
•It is best to keep your incision open to air but it is ok to 
cover it when outside. 
•Call your surgeon if there are any signs of infection like 
redness, fever, or drainage. 

Activity
•We recommend that you avoid heavy lifting, running, climbing, 
or other strenuous exercise until your follow-up appointment.
•You make take leisurely walks and slowly increase your 
activity at your own pace once you are symptom free at rest. 
___ try to do too much all at once.
•No driving while taking any narcotic or sedating medication. 
•If you experienced a seizure while admitted, you are NOT 
allowed to drive by law. 
•No contact sports until cleared by your neurosurgeon. You 
should avoid contact sports for 6 months. 

Medications
•***You have been discharged on Keppra (Levetiracetam). This 
medication helps to prevent seizures. Please continue this 
medication as indicated on your discharge instruction. It is 
important that you take this medication consistently and on 
time. 
•You may use Acetaminophen (Tylenol) for minor discomfort if 
you are not otherwise restricted from taking this medication.

What You ___ Experience:
•You may have difficulty paying attention, concentrating, and 
remembering new information.
•Emotional and/or behavioral difficulties are common. 
•Feeling more tired, restlessness, irritability, and mood 
swings are also common.
•You may also experience some post-operative swelling around 
your face and eyes. This is normal after surgery and most 
noticeable on the second and third day of surgery.  You apply 
ice or a cool or warm washcloth to your eyes to help with the 
swelling. The swelling will be its worse in the morning after 
laying flat from sleeping but decrease when up. 
•You may experience soreness with chewing. This is normal from 
the surgery and will improve with time. Softer foods may be 
easier during this time. 
•Constipation is common. Be sure to drink plenty of fluids and 
eat a high-fiber diet. If you are taking narcotics (prescription 
pain medications), try an over-the-counter stool softener.
Headaches:
•Headache is one of the most common symptoms after a brain 
bleed. 
•Most headaches are not dangerous but you should call your 
doctor if the headache gets worse, develop arm or leg weakness, 
increased sleepiness, and/or have nausea or vomiting with a 
headache. 
•Mild pain medications may be helpful with these headaches but 
avoid taking pain medications on a daily basis unless prescribed 
by your doctor. 
•There are other things that can be done to help with your 
headaches: avoid caffeine, get enough sleep, daily exercise, 
relaxation/ meditation, massage, acupuncture, heat or ice packs.

IMAGING
.
MRI Brain (___):
IMPRESSION: Acute right-sided MCA distribution infarcts.
.
MRA Brain (___):
IMPRESSION: Focal flow gap in the right MCA bifurcation, likely 
secondary to
a thrombus in this region. The hyperintense vessels are seen on 
FLAIR in the
right parietal region which could be secondary to slow flow. 
Opacification of
the right maxillary sinus is seen with inspissited secretions.
.
CT Head (___):
There is no intracranial hemorrhage. Parenchymal hypodensity is 
noted on the
right, in an MCA distribution primarily involving the temporal 
lobe,
progressed since ___. The ventricles and sulci are 
normal in size
and in configuration. Focal hypodensities are also noted at the 
right basal
ganglia, consistent with diffusion abnormalities seen in the 
same location on
a comparison MR. ___ soft tissue structures are 
unremarkable. The
included paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are clear and 
the visualized
osseous structures reveal no fracture.

 
Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ is a ___ year-old man with a past medical history 
including mitral valve replacement with a mechanical valve who 
presented to an outside hospital with left facial droop and 
left-sided weakness. A CT of the head revealed a right MCA 
infarct and he was transferred to the ___ for further care.  
He was admitted to the stroke service from ___ to ___.
.
An MRI of the brain demonstrated acute infarctions in the right 
temporal lobe, right deep basal ganglia, and right 
temporo-occipital watershed distribution in the setting of a 
subtherapeutic INR.  The strokes were thought to be due to 
cardioembolic events.  Accordingly, the heparin drip was 
continued with a PTT goal of 50-70.  The patient's outpatient 
regimen of coumadin was also restarted.
.
Blood pressure was allowed to autoregulate with a goal SBP under 
180.
.
To evaluate modifiable risk factors for stroke, lipids and 
glycosylated hemoglobin were measured.  The LDL was found to be 
170; as the stroke was thought to be due to 
cardio-thromboembolic events, a statin was not started.  
Although the HBA1C was 5.5 %, blood glucose was monitored 
regularly and an insulin sliding was instituted to maintain 
normoglycemia.
.
The patient was discharged home with lovenox.
