IMAGING: 
CT Chest
IMPRESSION:  
Extensive bilateral ground-glass opacities with peripheral 
fibrosis, 
bronchiectasis, and a few scattered foci of honeycombing are new 
from ___.  
These findings ___ represent progression of NSIP, however due to 
significant 
respiratory motion, superimposed infectious process is difficult 
to exclude in 
the appropriate clinical context.  If clinically indicated, 
recommend further 
evaluation with nonurgent, high-resolution CT scan with ILD 
protocol 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ presented with fever and altered mental status and 
was found to have hypoxic respiratory failure and septic shock. 
He also had one run of sustained ventricular tachycardia from 
hypokalemia that resolved with potassium repletion. Regarding 
his septic shock, he was given fluids and vasopressors. He was 
found to have positive blood cultures with group B strep with 
subsequent TTE showing a vegetation on his mitral valve and was 
receiving IV antibiotics for endocarditis. His hypoxic 
respiratory failure continued to worsen during his ICU stay. 
Initially thought secondary to bacterial pneumonia on top of his 
severe non-specific interstitial pneumonia exacerbated by volume 
overload, Mr. ___ initially responded favorably to 
antibiotics and diuresis. However, his baseline dementia 
complicated by ICU delirium lead to silent aspiration 
contributing to worsening lung function. His pulmonary edema 
also began to worsen despite aggressive diuresis. He 
decompensated overnight on ___ with severe tachypnea and 
accessory muscle use. He was placed back on HFNC and given 
morphine for dyspnea. He was started on steroids for any 
contribution from his ILD recognizing the risk of worsening his 
endocarditis. A family meeting was held subsequent to his 
clinical deterioration, a living will from Mr. ___ 
documented that he would not want life-sustaining treatments if 
there was no hope of meaningful recovery/quality of life. Thus, 
the goal of care was shifted to focusing on comfort/quality of 
life. Later in the day on ___, Mr. ___ expired from 
hypoxic respiratory failure.
