History of Present Illness:
 Ms. ___ is a ___ right-handed White
woman with a past medical history of an atypical headache
disorder since ___ yo., also cervical fusion of C4-C5-C6 in 
___ and DM2, HTN, dyslipidemia, who now presents to the ED for
an exacerbation of her usual headaches; this is her third ED
visit over the last week, and today she was referred by her 
outpt
neurologist, Dr. ___ at ___. 
Starting at ___ yo., Ms. ___ has had periodic exacerbations
of her left-sided occipital ___. This was initially diagnosed 
as
a nerve impingement, and for a long time, she treated it
symptomatically with aspirin or NSAIDs and heat. About ___ years
ago, she received a diagnosis of atypical migraine at ___. She
was given sumatriptan as a preventative, but thinks that this 
has
only once aborted her headaches, and has generally been
unhelpful. She has never been on a preventative medication. More
recently, she has been taking daily tramadol and acetaminophen
but was told to stop this for fear that she might be at risk of
rebound headaches. She has been taking gabapentin 300 mg BID for
cervical radiculopathy but this seems to have no effect on her
headaches. Ms. ___ stopped taking her daily ___
medications about 2 weeks before the current exacerbation
started. 
On ___, pt started developing a headache that is similar to her
previous ones but much more severe; in fact, it is the worst she
has ever had. It is otherwise similar in its features: short
pangs of electric ___ at her occiput, in bursts, exacerbated by
putting pressure on the area. Each brief stab of ___ radiates 
to
the left postauricular area and vertex. Initially, attacks were
about three times per minute but have since greatly increased in
frequency. She has been in excruciating ___ for most of the day
but has generally been able to sleep, with recurrence of ___ in
the morning. Denies
nausea, vomiting, photophobia. Loud sounds annoy her but do not
make the headaches worse. She denies dizziness or aura. She has
allodynia - her hair is sensitive to the touch and to combing.
Ms. ___ went to our ED on ___, and was given ketorolac IV
without much relief; she was sent home but the ___ recurred in
the early morning hours of ___ at ___ severity. Ms. ___
than went to ___ on ___, where she again 
received
ketorolac without relief but then received a local
steroid/lidocaine injection, which gave her almost complete
relief for about 8 hours. 
Ms. ___ went to see Dr. ___ in the office today. He 
gave
her a prescription for a trial of ___ and a prednisone
taper. Ms. ___ took the ___ without relief but 
did
not start the steroid taper before coming to the ED. Dr. ___ urged the pt to visit the ED to get a CT brain without
contrast to evaluate for intraparenchymal hemorrhage,
subarachnoid hemorrhage, and mass. When seen by me, Ms. 
___
was in ___ ___, with frequent pangs of ___ interrupting our
interview. He also recommended to the ED that they consider
giving her a valproate infusion of 1,000mg over 30 minutes iv to
stop potential status migrainosus, and that they request a
neurology consult for her in the ED. 
In the ED, pt received the valproate infusion at our
recommendation but had no relief from this. She then received
hydromorphone 1 mg IV with partial relief for a short time, and
was then given another 1 mg.

Pertinent Results:
___ ___: 
FINDINGS: There is no acute hemorrhage, edema or shift of the 
normally midline 
structures.  Slight prominence of the ventricles and sulci is 
presumably from 
age-related involutional changes.  The gray-white matter 
differentiation is 
preserved, without evidence for an acute territorial vascular 
infarction.  The 
basal cisterns remain patent.  There is mild mucosal thickening 
within the 
ethmoid air cells.  Otherwise, the imaged paranasal sinuses and 
mastoid air 
cells are well aerated.  There is no acute osseous abnormality. 
  
IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial process. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ was admitted to the general neurology service for 
___ control. She was initially given a loading dose of valproic 
acid in attempt to about her headaches. This provided no 
improvement in her symptoms. With this result, as well as a lack 
of efficancy with previous treatments directed at migraines, 
along with her description of the symptoms, her headaches were 
thought to be most consistent with occipital neuralgia. There 
___ also have been a component of chronic daily headache, as the 
patient has been using NSAIDs for ___ relief on a regular 
basis. She was initially given narcotics PRN for ___ control 
which dulled the ___ somewhat, but did not give total relief. 
The ___ service was consulted who recommended treatment with 
scheduled tylenol, ibuprofen and flexeril. An increase in dosing 
of gabapentin to 600mg TID and starting daily amitriptyline was 
also recommended. The patient was discharged on this regimen 
with close follow up planned at the ___ 
___ and with her neurologist, Dr. ___.
