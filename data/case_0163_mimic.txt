1.  RIGHT L4 SEGMENTAL ARTERY:  Injection demonstrates 
normal-appearing 
segmental artery with no evidence of spinal cord nor fistulous

fistula. 
  
2.  LEFT L4:  There is roughly conjoined origin of the bilateral 
L4s, but the left L4 demonstrates no evidence of spinal cord 
supply nor any evidence of fistulous supply. 
  
3.  LEFT L3:  Shows a normal segmental artery with no evidence 
of spinal cord supply nor fistulous supply. 
  
4.  RIGHT L3:  Demonstrates a small segmental artery that has 
previously been embolized and there is only minimal fill in the 
proximal origin of the segmental artery, but there is no 
evidence of fistulous supply or spinal cord supply from this 
level. 
  
5.  LEFT L2:  A normal segmental artery is seen with no evidence 
of spinal 
cord supply nor evidence of fistulous supply. 
  
6.  RIGHT L2:  Roughly conjoined origin of the bilateral L2

what looks to be a vessel that had already been previously 
partially embolized with almost thrombosis.  There is no 
evidence of segmental spinal cord supply nor a fistulous supply.
