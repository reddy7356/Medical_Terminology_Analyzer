History of Present Illness:
Mr. ___ is a ___ yo male with a pmh of HTN and ETOH abuse 
___ EOTH abuse who presents to the ED with altered mental status 
and pain in his L wrist, R hand, head, neck and faceOn initial 
evaluation patient was obviously intoxicated and stated he was 
assaulted by multiple assailants (time unknown). He denied any 
LOC during this event.  He also denies any emesis. He does 
endorse pain in his left lateral neck, face, right hand, left 
wrist after the assault. On re-assessment in the ED, the patient 
appeared more sober and lucid stated that he was walking behind 
loading docks when a group of 3 men demanded his winter coat on 
___. When he declined to acquiesce to their demand, he was 
assaulted, hit in the head with a pipe, face ground into the 
cement, and was "stomped on" several times.  He was helped to 
the ED by 2 strangers.  He notes that his last drink was 
yesterday (did not know timing), but insistent that while he can 
drink to excess, he often goes a week or more at a time between 
drinks. He denies sensation of withdrawals and states he has no 
itching of skin or signs hallucinations.

The patient also endorsed several days of coughing productive of 
green sputum. He also reports dyspnea over this period time as 
well. He denies known aspiration events. He denies fevers or 
chills, chest pain, nausea, vomit, diarrhea, abdominal pain, 
numbness, or weakness.

In the ED, initial VS were 97.3 85 127/70 15 97% RA. Physical 
exam was significant for facial ulcerations consistent with the 
described assault, and significant pain/swelling in the L wrist. 
 X-ray showed an impacted fracture of the distal radius with 
mild medial and volar displacement of the distal fracture 
fragment with soft tissue swelling. Head CT showed no signs 
intracranial hemorrhage. C-spine was cleared. CT torso showed 
scattered consolidations throughout the bilateral lungs, 
concerning for
multifocal pneumonia.  X-ray of the hips and R hand was 
unremarkable.  Orthopedics attempted external reduction and 
wrist was splinted with plan for surgery as outpatient. 
Labs showed Negative UA, UTox screen positive for Benzos, 
opiates, cocaine, ETOH 179, BNP WNL WBC 7.7, H/H 11.1/36.7. Due 
to concern for multifocal PNA patient was started on clindamycin 
and lecvofloxacin.

ED Orders:
IVF 1000 mL NS 1000 mL   
IV Morphine Sulfate 2 mg x2
IV Fentanyl Citrate 50 mcg x3
IV/IM Lorazepam 1 mgx3
PO/NG Gabapentin 1200
PO/NG TraZODone 50 mg
IV Levofloxacin 750 mg 
IV Clindamycin 600 mg 

Given concern for multifocal pneumonia and recent assault with 
very poor follow up, will admit to medicine for help with 
disposition and continued medical management. Transfer VS were  
. Social work was consulted for placement and orthopedics was 
consulted for recommendations regarding L wrist fracture. 

On arrival to the floor, patient reports L wrist pain and a 
headache, requesting IV pain medications.

DISCHARGE LABS:
================
___ 06:45AM BLOOD WBC-8.2 RBC-4.16* Hgb-11.1* Hct-36.5* 
MCV-88 MCH-26.7 MCHC-30.4* RDW-19.5* RDWSD-62.7* Plt ___

K-5.0 Cl-96 HCO3-31 AnGap-14
___ 06:45AM BLOOD Calcium-9.6 Phos-3.7 Mg-1.___ with history of HTN, hereditary peripheral neuropathy type 
1, ETOH abuse who presents with L wrist fracture and multifocal 
PNA concerning for CAP vs aspiration PNA.

#PNA: Patient had a 1 week history of episodes of shortness of 
breath and increased thick green sputum.  He was breathing well 
on RA, and not noted to have leukocytosis or fevers on 
admission.  However, given patients altered mental status 
patient underwent CT Torso in addition to other imaging 
(discussed below) and CT chest showed scattered consolidations 
throughout the bilateral lungs, concerning for multifocal 
pneumonia. The patient was started of Levofloxacin and 
Clindamycin in the ED. Etiology likely CAP vs aspiration pna 
given history of EOTH abuse.  Patient was started on Ceftriaxone 
1g IV Q12, Flagyl 500mg IV Q8H, and Azithromycin 500mg x1 day 
and 250x4 days as well as guifenasin/dextromethoraphan .  
Patient was quickly transitioned to Cefpedoxime, Flagyl and 
azithromycin with good effect, reduced sputum and no episodes of 
fevers or shortness of breath. Of note, patient did have 
occasional wheezing which improved with duonebs, though patient 
has not had documented history of COPD, asthma or smoking.   

#L Wrist Fracture: Presented with significant L wrist pain.  
This was a closed injury and the patient was deemed 
neurovascularly intact. X-ray showed an impacted fracture of the 
distal radius with mild medial and volar displacement of the 
distal fracture fragment is demonstrated with surrounding soft 
tissue swelling.  No dislocation is identified.  Mild 
degenerative changes are seen involving the first CMC and 
triscaphe joints.  Patient underwent 2x hematoma blocks with 
10cc lidocaine performed dorsally from Orthopedics. Initial 
reduction attempt performed after gravity-hung finger trap, and 
sugar tong splint. Post-reduction film without change in wrist 
anatomy. ___ reduction performed with dorsal/volar splint and 
hanging weights, again with post-reduction films without change. 
After two unsuccessful reduction attempts with hematoma block, 
and final radiology reads, the radial fracture appeared 
consistent with sub-acute chronicity. Patient was placed in 
splint with plan for further evaluation.  The patient noted the 
wrist remained painful with episode of numbness/decreased 
sensation in ring/pinky, but no distal pain, no sign of loss of 
perfusion. This parasthesia was examined by orthopedics who felt 
the radial nerve distribution distally may have been traumatic 
neurapraxia as all motor modalities intact. Pain was controlled 
with IV dilaudid and morphine, and later transitioned to PO 
morphine and oxycodone with reasonable control. Patient was 
advised to stay in splint with plan to follow up in hand clinic 
for further evaluation. 

#Right Knee: Patient noted right knee pain. Was noted to have 
pain with weight bearing and passive ROM. Increased varus 
laxity.  R Knee showed no fracture only degenerative changes.  
MRI was attempted but patient was unable to tolerate due to leg 
shaking and restlessness.  Patient was made an appointment with 
___ orthopedics for follow up evaluation on ___ for ongoing 
follow up and discharged to rehabilitation with R knee brace.

#AMS: Patient initially presented on the floor with 
waxing/waning attention and somnolence during conversation.  He 
was appropriate otherwise in conversation and oriented x3.  
After 1 day, mentation returned to baseline.  Upon reflection, 
likely due to combination of narcotic medications received in ED 
and lack of sleep. CT head showed no acute intracranial process. 
 Currently, not unreasonable to attribute to lack of sleep (pool 
side in ED) and recent meds.  
- Continue to monitor for status change in mentation, if 
worsening or persists, will consider additional head imaging and 
consult neurology

#Headaches: Describes intermittent headaches, that are intense, 
bilateral, causing blurry vision and nausea.  Reports no 
previous history of headaches, only started after assault. 
Appear consistent with concussion like symptoms following head 
trauma. Self resolving.

#ETOH Abuse: History of alcohol abuse. No sign of active 
withdrawals on admission. Started on CIWA diazepam protocol, but 
was negative (<10) over 48 hours before discontinued.  He 
received Thiamine 100mg PO daily, Folic acid 1mg daily, and 
multivitamin. 

#Facial ulceration: Occurred during trauma. Had gold/honey 
crusting concerning for superficial staph infection, now 
improving. Used Mupirocin topical PRN with good effect. 

#L Molar Pain: patient reported on day of discharge discomfort 
with eating hard foods in L molar. No signs of jaw fracture, or 
pain at TMJ.  He underwent panorex imaging (final read pending). 
Patient was advised to seek outside follow up.

#HTN: Normotensive. Continue home meds, amlodipine and 
lisinopril.

#Neuropathy: Per patient longstanding history of familial 
hereditary neuropathy type I, treated with gabapentin and 
tramadol. Continued home doses. 

#Anxiety/Psych: Recent diagnosis of bipolar and long standing 
history of anxiety. Continued home doses of Depakote and 
citalopram and ambien. Held lorazepam while inpatient, restarted 
once discharged. 

#Gout: Stable, on allopurinol at home.

#Disposition: Patient is homeless living in shelter with history 
of assaults.  Given his current impaired physical state, he was 
deemed appropriate for physical rehabilitation first.

ED exam was notable for diffuse end-expiratory wheezing. He was 
agitated and complaining of very dry mouth. His pupils were 
equal and reactive. He was given several rounds of Haldol and 
Ativan for agitation. He was intubated to facilitate CTA chest. 
He underwent NINE attempts at intubation before success with 
glidescope by Anesthesia at the bedside. He was taken for CTA 
chest and then transferred to MICU. Transfer vitals were 87 
95/59 22 100% Intubated. 

On arrival to MICU, he is intubated and sedated.

IMAGING/STUDIES:
========================
___ CTA CHEST:
1. Low lung volumes, perihilar and bilateral lower lobe 
consolidations, and bronchial wall thickening is concerning for 
aspiration, given the presence of endobronchial secretions. 
2. No evidence of pulmonary embolism or acute aortic pathology. 
3. Borderline hilar and mediastinal lymph nodes are likely 
reactive. 

___ CT HEAD:
1. No evidence for acute intracranial abnormalities. 
2. Mucosal thickening and fluid in the paranasal sinuses are 
most likely 
secondary to endotracheal intubation, but please correlate 
clinically whether there are signs of sinusitis. 

___ MR HEAD:
1. No acute intracranial abnormality. 
2. Mild paranasal sinus disease. 

___ CXR:
Interval removal of ET tube and NG tube. 
Considerable interval improvement in previously seen 
retrocardiac opacity, 
though residual patchy opacity remains present. 
New small right cardiomediastinal patchy opacity -?  
Atelectasis, although 
attention to this area on followup films is requested to exclude 
a focus of aspiration pneumonitis or an infectious pneumonic 
infiltrate.

===========================
___ man with a history of bipolar disorder, PTSD, ETOH abuse, 
and recent admission to Plastic Surgery Service for L distal 
radius fracture, who was sent in from ___ for 
somnolence. Of note, he had been given multiple sedating 
medications on the day of discharge from Plastics. When he 
arrived in the ED he became agitated and received several 
sedating medications requiring intubation for airway protection 
and was treated in the ICU for aspiration pneumonia. Extubation 
was delayed due to ongoing altered mental status, but patient 
was eventually extubated and transferred to the floor. His O2 
sats remained stable on room air, and he completed a course of 
Augmentin for PNA. He was evaluated by Psychiatry, who felt his 
agitation was secondary to a manic episode from his biopolar 
with some superimposed agitated delirium secondary to the 
multiple sedating medications he had received, and his medicines 
were adjusted. Of note, he was tachycardic throughout 
hospitalization, which was attributed to Seroquel.

ACTIVE ISSUES:
===========================
# TOXIC METABOLIC ENCEPHALOPATHY:
Patient sent in from ___ with sedation, but was 
confused and agitated on arrival to the ED, and immediately 
required sedation. It was unclear what caused this presentation, 
but on review of the record, he had received multiple sedating 
medications on the day of discharge from plastic surgery, most 
likely in the context of him developing a manic episode. On 
admission, CT head showed no acute process. After being 
intubated & sedated, patient remained confused. This was likely 
multifactorial etiology. He was evaluated by Neurology, and had 
a negative EEG. He was evaluated by Psychiatry, who felt he was 
suffering from a manic episode from his bipolar, that may have 
been worsened by high-dose steroids. He was stabilized on a 
regimen of QUEtiapine Fumarate 100 mg TID and Divalproex 
(DELayed Release) 500 mg PO BID. He also completed the 
phenobarbital protocol for alcohol withdrawal, as this was 
thought to possibly be the precipitant, however patient denied 
etoh use. He received high dose-thiamine, MVI & folic acid as 
well. At time of discharge, he was mentating well.

# PNEUMONIA: 
Patient spiked a fever in the ICU, which was initially 
attributed to patient's Precedex. CXR showed consolidation, so 
pneumonia was thought to be the course. He completed an 8-day 
course with Vanc/Cefepime that was de-escalated to 
Amoxicillin-Clavulanic Acid ___ mg PO/NG Q12H thru ___.

# ACUTE RESPIRATORY FAILURE WITH HYPOXEMIA: 
Patient initially presented with somnolence, agitation, and 
hypoxemia. Hypoxemia was likely due to aspiration pneumonitis v 
chemical pneumonitis v pneumonia. He was intubated for airway 
protection. CTA negative for PE. He received steroid therapy for 
airway edema, but became stable on room air. Pneumonia was 
treated, as above.

# POLYSUBSTANCE ABUSE: History of alcohol abuse but denies any 
recently. Unclear ingestions. Completed the phenobarbital 
protocol for alcohol withdrawal. Social work was consulted, and 
patient was continued on thiamine, folate & a multivitamin. 

# TACHYCARDIA: Patient was tachycardic to 130s on ___, which 
was thought to be due to Quetiapine. His dose was decreased, and 
tachycardia improved to the ___. He remained asymptomatic with 
no chest pain, palpitations, or shortness of breath. 

# LEFT DISTAL RADIUS FRACTURE: s/p ORIF and release on ___. 
Plastics following as inpatient, re-inforced at bedside. He 
received Tylenol for pain. 

CHRONIC STABLE ISSUES:
===========================
# Gout: Cont allopurinol.  

# Hypertension: Patient's Lisinopril was stopped because it was 
not needed. Home 
Verapamil SR 120 mg PO Q24H was continued.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
===========================
# TACHYCARDIA: Patient was tachycardic to ___ consistently 
throughout admission. He was asymptomatic, without dyspnea or 
hypoxemia. He was not dehydrated. Possibly secondary to 
Seroquel.
# LEFT RADIAL FRACTURE: Patient was discharged with a cast over 
left arm. Per discharge instructions:  Left wrist should be 
maintained in the splint and not removed. Left wrist should be 
elevated to alleviate swelling and pain. Patient should continue 
to do ROM to digits to prevent stiffness. He has scheduled 
follow-up with ortho on ___
# PSYCH MEDICINES: QUEtiapine Fumarate 100 mg TID. Divalproex 
(DELayed Release) 500 mg PO qAM and 1g QHS
# LISINOPRIL: Lisinopril 40mg daily was stopped because patient 
was not hypertensive without it in the hospital
