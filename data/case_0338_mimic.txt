EXAMINATION: CT of the abdomen with intravenous contrast. 
  
COMPARISONS: Comparison to recent CT from ___ and CT of the 
torso from 
___. 
  
TECHNIQUE: Helically acquired axial images were obtained from 
the lung bases 
to the pubic symphysis after the administration of oral and 130 
cc of Optiray 
intravenous contrast. Coronal and sagittal reformations were 
obtained. Three- 
minute delays were obtained through the abdomen. 
  
FINDINGS: 
  
CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: There is a small- 
to moderate- 
sized right pleural effusion with associated adjacent 
atelectatic changes. 
There is an irregular in appearance 17 x 13 mm pulmonary nodule 
located in the 
left lung base, not significantly changed since recent 
examination from 
___, best seen on 2:7. No other pulmonary parenchymal 
opacities or 
pulmonary nodules. 
  
There are innumerable hypodense lesions scattered throughout the 
entire liver 
with expansion of the surrounding parenchyma, with both 
increased in number 
and size of pre-existing lesions since recent CT examination 
from ___, 
compatible with interval progression of known metastatic 
disease. In 
addition, there is a dominant mass seen centered within the 
lesser sac, best 
appreciated on 2:33, with some interval progression in size, now 
measuring 70 
x 51 mm, where on prior examination, it measured 60 x 53 mm. 
There is 
subjacent compression of the small bowel in immediate proximity 
to this mass 
with some gaseous distention of the third and fourth portions of 
the duodenum; 
however, contrast is seen distal to this point with contrast 
flowing freely 
through to the mid-to-distal ileum without evidence of small 
bowel 
obstruction. In addition, there is invasion of this mass to the 
adjacent 
proximal jejunal loop and encasement of both the celiac and SMA 
vessels by 
this mass. The SMV and splenic vein are obliterated, and the 
portal vein is 
distally reconstituted via collaterals. There is metastatic 
retroperitoneal 
lymphadenopathy. There is a moderate amount of intra-abdominal 
fluid that has 
increased in extent with some areas of higher attenuation seen 
distally, 
particularly about the right paracolic gutter that is suggestive 
of complex 
components. The pancreas is partially encased by the large known 
metastatic 
focus. 
  
The patient is status post left hemicolectomy. There is no 
abnormal stranding 
surrounding the remainder of the colon that would suggest 
colitis. 
  
The kidneys enhance symmetrically with excretion of contrast 
through the 
ureters. 
  
CT OF THE PELVIS WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: The rectum, sigmoid 
colon, and 
bladder are unremarkable. The prostate is stably enlarged. Again 

demonstrated is a small right fat-containing inguinal hernia. 
There is free 
fluid within the pelvis. No significant inguinal or pelvic 
lymphadenopathy. 
  
BONE WINDOWS: No suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesions 
identified. 
Degenerative change most prominent at the level of L5-S1. 

IMPRESSION: 
1. Interval progression of metastatic disease seen with hepatic 
metastases 
increased in both size and number, and a dominant mass centered 
in the lesser 
sac. 
2. No gross evidence of colitis or obstruction. 
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist. 

___. ___ 
___. ___ 
___ ___ 12:05 ___ 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ with refractory metastatic colon ca, HTN, Afib, treated on 
___ (avastin held) arrives with persistent abd pain 
for 2wks with an episode of hypotension/fever and CT with no e/o 
acute process. 
.
# Abd pain: The persistent nature and CT make it likely 
progression of metastatic disease as there has been interval 
increase in size and number of liver mets as well as the mass 
centered in the lesser sac. Moreover, there is compression of 
the duodenum but no evidence of obstruction, perforation, 
colitis or inflammation. On presentation the pt's transient 
hypotension, low-grade temps, and chronic guiauc pos diarrhea 
was also concerning for primary or superimposed infection/sepsis 
as well. Blood cultures, C Diff, stool cx, and O+P are still 
pending, however, they are no growth to date. The patient 
improved over 24 hours with bowel rest, and pain control with 
the patient's home percocet along with PO dilaudid for 
breakthrough pain.  
.
# Afib: Patient was stable without SVT or palpitations 
throughout the admission. His home metoprolol was continued. 
.
# Anxiety: Patient's home clonazapem was continued. 
.
# FEN/GI: Patient's home KCl 20meq was continued. There were no 
in hospital electrolyte disturbances.
