PCP's office with shortness of breath.  

Patient presented to his PCP's office today with persistent 
chest congestion associated with shortness of breath, cough, and 
increased sputum production (no hemoptysis). He says that his 
symptoms all began in late ___ ('He had a cold,' according 
to his wife) and have waxed and waned since then, ultimately 
progressing with significant fatigue and exertional SOB. Whereas 
patient previously was in reported good health, regularly going

climbing only two flights of stairs. No subjective fevers or 
night sweats, patient has noticed brow sweat quite often as of 
late. He denies any lower extremity swelling or increased 
weight. There does seem to be a new sensation of abdominal 
distension. No exertional chest pain or palpitations. No 
lightheadedness/dizziness. No orthopnea. No symptoms consistent 
with PND. Patient has received azithromycin on two occasions 
without any relief. Trialing mucinex and cleaning his CPAP 
machine have also been of little help. Given patient's 
persistent symptoms, he was instructed to present to the ___ 
for further evaluation and acute management.

IMAGING:
==================
-CXR ___
FINDINGS:  
PA and lateral views of the chest provided.  Cardiomegaly is 
noted with 
pulmonary vascular congestion and mild interstitial pulmonary 
edema.  No large effusion is seen.  No signs of pneumonia.  
Mediastinal contour is grossly unremarkable.  Bony structures 
are intact.  
IMPRESSION:  As above. 
-TTE ___
The left atrial volume index is moderately increased. The right 
atrium is mildly enlarged. The estimated right atrial pressure 
is >15mmHg. There is SEVERE global left ventricular hypokinesis. 
The visually estimated left ventricular ejection fraction is 
25%. There is no resting left ventricular outflow tract 
gradient. No thrombus or mass is seen in the left ventricle. 
Mildly dilated right ventricular cavity with low normal free 
wall motion. The aortic sinus diameter is normal with mildly 
dilated ascending aorta.
The aortic arch diameter is normal. The aortic valve leaflets 
(3) are mildly thickened. There is no aortic valve stenosis. 
There is no aortic regurgitation. The mitral leaflets appear 
structurally normal. There is
no mitral valve stenosis. There is moderate [2+] mitral 
regurgitation. The tricuspid valve leaflets appear structurally 
normal. There is moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation. There is 
moderate pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Mitral and tricuspid 
regurgitation may be significantly underestimated due to far 
field attenuation.

and OSA who presented with shortness of breath found to have 
acute systolic congestive heart failure, coronary 
atherosclerotic disease, and hypertensive urgency.

#Acute systolic congestive heart failure:
Patient was referred from his PCP's office to the hospital in 
the setting of progressive shortness of breath and chest 
congestion. Evaluation was notable for exam with elevated JVP, 
abdominal distension, lab work showing BNP elevation, and CXR 
with pulmonary edema concerning for new congestive heart 
failure. TTE showed global systolic dysfunction (LVEF = 25%), 
without evidence of regional wall abnormalities or gross 
valvular pathology. Work-up of new CHF notable for negative 
troponins, TSH within normal limits, normal iron studies, 
negative HIV, lipid panel within normal limits, negative 
SPEP/UPEP. Cardiac cath notable for 70% stenosis of LCx, 40-50% 
stenosis of RCA; no interventions were performed. He received IV 
diuresis with improvement in his respiratory status. He was 
started on guideline-directed therapy with PRELOAD: lasix 20mg 
daily; AFTERLOAD: lisinopril 40mg daily, imdur 30mg 
daily/hydralazine 25mg TID; NHBK: spironolactone 25mg daily. 
Metoprolol was deferred in the setting of low CI and 
tachycardia. He should have a cMRI for further evaluation of 
etiologies of his HF. Metoprolol should be initiated as an 
outpatient. 
-Discharge weight: 105.7 kg (233.02 lb) 

#Hypertensive urgency:
Patient longstanding hypertension, recently with poor control 
over the last x6 months. His home lisinopril was uptitrated to 
40mg daily and he was started on hydralazine/imdur and 
spironolactone with improvement in his BPs.

#Coronary atherosclerotic disease:
In the setting of new CHF, patient underwent catheterization 
notable for CAD. He received high dose aspirin x1, and then was 
started on aspirin/statin.

CHRONIC ISSUES:
#T2DM:
He was continued on his home metformin

#OSA:
He continued on CPAP in the hospital

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
[] Consider Cardiac MRI for further evaluation of new CHF in x3 
months to assess for recovery
[] If weight continuing to downtrend, would consider changing 
Lasix to PRN with weight >3lb change
[] Would recommend starting bblocker at outpatient visit if 
patient continues to improve
[] Discharge weight: 105.7 kg (233.02 lb)

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,

It was a pleasure caring for you at ___ 
___.

WHY WAS I ADMITTED TO THE HOSPITAL?
-You had difficulty breathing in recent weeks due to excess 
fluid in your lungs.

WHAT HAPPENED WHILE I WAS IN THE HOSPITAL?
-We took pictures of your heart (echocardiogram), which showed 
that your heart was not squeezing well.
-We then took pictures of the blood vessels in your heart, which 
showed a partial blockage of a single blood vessel. This does 
not explain why your heart is not squeezing well.
-We gave you a medication (Lasix) to remove extra fluid.
-We changed your blood pressure medications.

WHAT SHOULD I DO WHEN I GO HOME?
-It is very important you follow-up with your new cardiologist 
(see appointments below) and take your new medications (see 
medication sheet).
-Weigh yourself every morning. Call your cardiologist or primary 
doctor if your weight increases by 3 pounds in a day or 5 pounds 
in a week.
-It is okay to exercise, but please avoid strenuous exercise or 
heavy lifting. Bike riding, walking, or jogging is okay.
-Please be mindful of the amount of salt you eat. As discussed, 
limit the amount of ___ food, deli meats, and salty barbecue
