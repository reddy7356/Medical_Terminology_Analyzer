IMPRESSION:  
1. No evidence of hemorrhage.  
2. Evolution of the previously visualized left pontine infarct. 
Large chronic right middle cerebral artery territory infarct  

___ RENAL ULTRASOUND
FINDINGS:  
The right kidney measures 9.6 cm. The left kidney measures 9.4 
cm. There is no hydronephrosis, stones, or masses bilaterally.  
Normal cortical echogenicity and corticomedullary 
differentiation are seen bilaterally. There is limited 
evaluation of the renal arteries bilaterally due to patient 
motion however, there is delayed upstroke and spectral 
broadening in the main renal artery and intrarenal arteries of 
the left kidney.  There is also mildly delayed upstroke in the 
intrarenal arteries of the right kidney. 
The bladder is moderately well distended and normal in 
appearance. 
IMPRESSION:  
Limited evaluation due to patient motion.  Within these 
limitations, there is delayed upstroke of the main and 
intrarenal arteries of the left kidney and mild delayed upstroke 
of the intrarenal arteries of the right kidneys.  These findings 
may reflect upstream stenosis.

transferred from ___ after presenting with slurred 
speech, N/V and found to have acute L pontine stroke attributed 
to small vessel disease in the setting of difficult to control 
hypertension, admitted on Neurology ___ and discharge to 
rehab, recently discharged, now presents with FTT and inability

-In the ED, initial VS were: 98.0 67 137/78 19 100% RA.
-ED labs were notable for: H/H 8.6/27.7. Normal LFTs. Chem7 
moderately hemolyzed with K 5.8 (5 on green top), Cl 109, Bicarb 
19, BUN/Cr ___. AG = 15. Normal coags.

-CXR showed: IMPRESSION: Low lung volumes. No definite 
pneumonia. 
-Head CT showed:
1. No evidence of acute territorial infarction or intracranial 
hemorrhage. Please note that MRI is more sensitive for the 
detection of acute stroke.
2. Evolution of the previously visualized left pontine infarct. 
Large chronic right MCA territory infarct.
-EKG showed: None.

Patient was given: 
___ 23:42 IVF  NS ( 1000 mL ordered) 
 
Transfer VS were: 98.1 66 156/88 16 100% RA. 

When seen on the floor, patient is oriented and pleasant if a 
bit soft spoken. She says that she was able to eat in the 
hospital and at the rehab. Two days ago, she stopped being able 
to eat. In particular, she swallows but the foods get caught in 
her throat. She gags and coughs up the food. The day before this 
happened, she was able to eat her modified diet without issue 
she says. She denies change in her speech or her vision, or new 
focal weakness. She denies fever, chills, HA, congestion, chest 
pain, shortness of breath, abdominal pain. She does endorse 
constipation. She does endorse burning with urination, but feels 
that her frequency of urination has gone down. She feels weak in 
"her whole body." 

Though this was not elicited on floor interview, per ED nursing 
documentation she had told them that, "her facility doesn't 
usually take the time to assist her with eating and believed her 
condition had changed." Per other ED documentation, she had 
failed a S&S, which the patient endorses though she does not 
state clearly when. Per the transfer documentation from the 
facility, she was only brought here for "change in mental 
status." Shortly after arrival to the floor she was given a 
small amount of thickened liquid at her request, but per nursing 
held this in her month, and with encouragement would not 
swallow.   

HCP was contacted at her request to the ED for update when 
patient reached the floor, and added that she believed dysphagia 
and SLP evaluations above happened ___, day of presentation 
to ED. She noted that after last stroke, she had to come up from 
___ to be with patient to encourage her to eat, and hired 
someone to stay with her for similar reason. She also has 
concerns about the ___ facility. Finally, she does not 
want the patient to be on antidepressants bc she thinks these 
have a paradoxical effect on the patient and make her less 
responsive and more confused.

Pertinent Results:
-DISCHARGE LABS ___: Na 136, K 4.1, Cl 102, Cr 1.0, glucose 
86
-Urine culture: >100,000 E Coli 
 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ hx HTN, HLD, DM, CKD (Cr 1.3 on last discharge), prior R MCA 
stroke with L hemiparesis, ___ resident, recently 
transferred from ___ after presenting with slurred 
speech, N/V and found to have acute L pontine stroke attributed 
to small vessel disease in the setting of difficult to control 
hypertension, admitted on Neurology ___ and discharge to 
rehab, re-presents with FTT and inability to take POs.

1. Dysphagia
-Unclear if there is a true problem, volitional component, 
manifestation of encephalopathy, or whether the rehab was simply 
not giving her enough attention at meals. Neurologic exam 
appears stable compared to recent discharge from Neurology. She 
has been quite lethargic at times and waxing/waning, which are 
likely a
manifestation of encephalopathy. Per SLP she is at baseline and 
continue thin liquids/puree solids and 1:1 assist with all 
meals. 

2. Dehydration, hypernatremia, Metabolic Acidosis, ___ on CKD
-Creatinine 2.2 due to poor PO intake and poor free water intake 
with contribution from ACE inhibitor and diuretic, which 
improved to Creatinine 1.0 with rehydration, holding ACEi, and 
discontinuing Lasix.  Unclear indication for Furosemide (?HTN), 
but in setting of multiple admissions for ___ and dehydration 
and it has been discontinued. Resumed ACEi at discharge and 
repeat BMP in 1 week. 

3. E Coli UTI 
-Patient received IV Ceftriaxone ___ and transitioned to PO 
cephalexin ___ through ___ to complete course of antibiotics.

4. Intermittent lethargy/metabolic encephalopathy
-She has waxing/waning levels of consciousness with similar 
reports at rehab facility likely multifactorial in the setting 
of the above problems.  Patient reports lethargy due to 
clonidine, so clonidine has been decreased from 0.2mg TID to 
0.1mg TID.  Recommend further titrating off if this seems to 
improve mental status. 

5. Failure to thrive
-Likely multifactorial as above. Continue to treat underlying 
medical issues. Patient must have 1:1 assistance with all meals. 


6. HTN
-Blood pressures very labile, which has been an issue during 
last admission as well. Lasix discontinued due to ___ and volume 
depletion.  Due to reports of clonidine-induced lethargy the 
dose was decreased from 0.2mg TID to 0.1mg TID; advise tapering 
further if this helps with mentation.  Continue hydralazine, 
clonidine, labetalol, lisinopril, and IMDUR; continue frequent 
blood pressure monitoring and adjust doses as needed. 

7. Urinary retention 
-Patient with one episode of urinary retention.  Monitor for 
bladder distention and decreased urine output.  Bladder scan (if 
possible) and straight cath with urinary retention >600mL.

Chronic Medical Problems
1. HLD: continue statin
2. DM: Recent HbA1c was 5. 
3. Gout: Holding allopurinol.
4. Anemia: stable, monitor (thrombocytopenia resolved)

Patient's HCP ___ updated.

Attending: ___.
 
Chief Complaint:
transfer for L pontine stroke
 
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

 
History of Present Illness:
The pt is a ___ year old right handed woman with history of HTN,
HLD, DM, CKD (b/l Cr 1.2), prior R MCA stroke with resultant L
hemiparesis, ___ resident, who presented to ___
with slurred speech, nausea, and vomiting, and is now 
transferred
upon discovery of acute left pontine stroke.

On history with the patient, she endorses a few days of 
gradually
worsening difficulty speaking, leading to other people being
unable to understand her. She also developed severe nausea, 
which
has now improved. She provides no other specific history but to
me denies double vision, blurred vision, dysphagia, difficulty
comprehending or finding words (merely speaking them), new
weakness, numbness or tingling.

On review of transfer documents, per the HPI:
"The patient states that her symptoms started last night with
generalized and progressive weakness associated with nausea but
no vomiting. She endorses mildly decreased PO intake. Otherwise,
there is no other complaint. She denies fevers, chills, dyspnea,
headache, hemoptysis, cough, or abdominal pain. In the ED, VS
were 97.9, 60, 10, 130/70, 98% RA. Exam showed blunted affect
with slow speech, clear lungs, normal cardiac and abdominal 
exam,
and left hemiparesis. Labs showed sodium of 154, Cr 2.66,
hemoglobin 8.8, troponin 0.07."

In ED, she underwent head CT which showed chronic large right 
MCA
infarct, otherwise no acute findings. She was admitted for 
workup
of her symptoms and underwent MRI/MRA head, which showed a left
pontine infarct, MRA showing no flow in b/l ACAs, and 50%
stenosis of distal L PCA and atherosclerotic irregularity of the
basilar artery. MRA neck showed 50% stenosis of left carotid, 
but
limited exam of right carotid artery. She was evaluated with a
TTE without bubble study which showed LVH with preserved 
systolic
function. She was treated with permissive hypertension and
underwent Swallow evaluation which cleared her for moist pureed
diet with honey thickened liquids.

In terms of her other medical problems, per discharge summary:
- Hypernatremia to 154- felt secondary to poor PO intake and
treated with D5W infusions. Na was 146 upon transfer.
- ___ with Cr at 2.66- last Cr was 1.18 in ___, but no recent
for comparison. Suspected secondary to dehydration or
post-obstructive uropathy given her retention, and was straight
cathed prn. Her lisinopril and furosemide were held. Cr was 2.74
at transfer.
- Troponin elevation to 0.07- without EKG changes, this was
attributed to acute stroke and were trended, peaking at 0.081 
and
down to 0.058 prior to transfer.

*******
Later history taken from niece and power of attorney ___:
She spoke to pt earlier this week (___) and her speech had
been completely normal and at baseline. Then the next day, her
speech was slow and slurred over the phone. She requested the

Imaging: 
MRI/MRA brain ___:
FINDINGS
Within the left paramedian pons, as seen on image 58 and 59, 
series 2, there is an area of restricted diffusion that is also 
FLAIR hyperintense.  The abnormality measures up to 10 mm in 
diameter.  The finding is consistent with a late acute to early 
subacute infarct.
      
There is re- demonstration of the large, chronic right middle 
cerebral artery territory infarct with associated porencephalic 
dilatation of the right lateral ventricle and considerable right 
cerebral sulcal dilatation.  There is also moderate extent of 
high T2 signal in the periventricular white matter of the left 
cerebral hemisphere, nonspecific in etiology, but probably 
chronic small vessel infarction.
       
There is  1-2 mm rightward subfalcine herniation, corresponding 
to the extensive malacic change seen within the right cerebral 
hemisphere, noted above.
      
The principal vascular flow patterns are identified, aside from 
the anterior cerebral arteries- please see MRA below.  There is 
mild bilateral ethmoid sinus mucosal thickening, compatible with 
an ongoing inflammatory process.

MR angiography of the circle of ___ and its tributaries 
discloses no visible arterial flow within either anterior 
cerebral artery. There is also a reduced flow within the right 
middle cerebral artery, presumably a consequence of the large 
chronic infarct and moderate (50%) stenosis of the the distal M1 
segment of the right middle cerebral artery.  Please see image 
9, series 100.  There is also mild to moderate, presumed 
atherosclerotic irregularity of the basilar artery.  There is a 
moderate (50%) stenosis of the distal P1 distal P2 segments of 
the left posterior cerebral artery.  Please see images ___ and ___, 
series 101.  There is no sign for the presence of an aneurysm or 
other vascular malformation within the limitations of this study 
technique.

MRA neck ___
FINDINGS
Unfortunately, there is considerable motion artifact degrading 
the 2D time-of-flight sequence, particularly at the aortic arch 
and origins of the great vessels, as well as the vertebral 
arteries.   The better quality 3D study  has very limited 
geographic coverage.  Within this significant interpretive 
limitation, there appears to be a mild (___) stenosis of the 
origin of the left internal carotid artery.  Please see image 
14, series 103.  The right common carotid bifurcation likely 
lies outside the field of coverage of the 3D study.  No gross 
stenosis is seen in this location on the motion-degraded 2D 
study.  Both vertebral arteries are tortuous and their origins 
are poorly shown on the motion-degraded 2D time-of-flight study.

TTE ___
Severe symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved 
systolic function. Doppler evidence of elevated left sided 
filling pressures. Normal valvular function.

Carotid Doppler ___: ___ mild plaque with ___ stenosis 
(likely low end of this range). LICA normal. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ was admitted with L pontine perforator artery 
territory infarct. Given distribution and uncontrolled 
hypertension, this was attributed to small vessel disease. She 
was continued on clopidogrel. 
She had a prerenal ___ of 2.7 from baseline 1.2 on transfer from 
___, which resolved with IVF. Cr 1.3 on day of discharge. 

Her hypertension was difficult to control, and on her home 
regimen it was noted that she was always >200 systolic prior to 
med administration and would drop systolic by over 100 points 
one hour after medications. Several of her medications were 
given more frequently in lower doses with goal of obtaining 
steady antihypertensive effect. 
She was evaluated by SLP and cleared for a dysphagia diet as 
described below.

24 hr interval events prior to discharge: 
No overnight events. Ms. ___ is feeling well this am. 
 
===========================
Transitional Issues: 
[ ] advance diet as tolerated
[ ] continue ___
[ ] continue antihypertensive titration with an eye to giving 
more frequent, smaller doses to achieve more steady BP.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,
You were hospitalized due to symptoms of slurred speech and 
right-sided weakness resulting from an ACUTE ISCHEMIC STROKE, a 
condition where a blood vessel providing oxygen and nutrients to 
the brain is blocked by a clot. The brain is the part of your 
body that controls and directs all the other parts of your body, 
so damage to the brain from being deprived of its blood supply 
can result in a variety of symptoms.
Stroke can have many different causes, so we assessed you for 
medical conditions that might raise your risk of having stroke. 
In order to prevent future strokes, we plan to modify those risk 
factors. Your risk factors are:
high blood pressure
high cholesterol

We are changing your medications as follows:
We adjusted your blood pressure medications. 
Please take your other medications as prescribed.

Please follow up with Neurology and your primary care physician 
as listed below.

If you experience any of the symptoms below, please seek 
emergency medical attention by calling Emergency Medical 
Services (dialing 911). In particular, since stroke can recur, 
please pay attention to the sudden onset and persistence of 
these symptoms:
- Sudden partial or complete loss of vision
- Sudden loss of the ability to speak words from your mouth
- Sudden loss of the ability to understand others speaking to 
you
- Sudden weakness of one side of the body
- Sudden drooping of one side of the face
- Sudden loss of sensation of one side of the body

Sincerely,
Your ___ Neurology Team
