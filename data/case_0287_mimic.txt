Brief Hospital Course:
The patient presented to the emergency department and was

reduction and internal fixation which the patient tolerated 
well. For full details of the procedure please see the 
separately dictated operative report. The patient was taken from

recovery from anesthesia was transferred to the floor. The 
patient was initially given IV fluids and IV pain medications, 
and progressed to a regular diet and oral medications by POD#1. 
The patient had significant pain on POD 1 and acute pain was 
consulted. Due to need for serial compartment checks to ensure 
the patient did not have compartment syndrome, a block was not 
performed. The patient's pain medication was adjusted so that 
she was comfortable enough to work with physical therapy. She 
was transitioned to an aircast boot. The patient was given 
___ antibiotics and anticoagulation per routine. The 
patient's home medications were continued throughout this

outpatient basis. The patient also had significant constipation, 
and a KUB was obtained on ___ to rule out obstructive process. 
Just prior to the KUB, the patient began to move her bowels 
spontaneously. The patient will be discharged on bowel 
medications to reduce the risk of opioid induced constipation 
The ___ hospital course was otherwise unremarkable.

At the time of discharge the patient's pain was well controlled 
with oral medications, incisions were clean/dry/intact, and the 
patient was voiding/moving bowels spontaneously. The patient is 
TDWB in the left lower extremity, and will be discharged on 4 
weeks of lovenox for DVT prophylaxis. The patient will follow up 
with Dr. ___ routine. A thorough discussion was had
