OTHER DIAGNOSTICS: EGD/EUS ___
EUS
findings: EUS was performed using a linear echoendoscope at 7.5 
MHz frequency: The head and uncinate pancreas were imaged from 
the duodenal bulb and the second / third duodenum. The body and 
tail [partially] were imaged from the gastric body and fundus.  

Pancreas parenchyma: The entire pancreas showed the following 
parenchymal changes : lobularity, hyperechoic foci, and 
hyperechoic strands. The pancreas was small in volume [atrophic] 
throughout especially at the body of the pancreas. The head of 
the pancreas could not be fully examined due to patient's 
anatomy. 

Pancreas duct:The pancreas duct measured 4 mm in the head and 2 
mm in the body of the pancreas. The walls of the duct were 
hyperchoic. The duct was regular. Pancreatic parenchymal and 
duct changes taken together are suggestive of moderate severity 
chronic pancreatitis.  

The ampulla was examined. This showed changes c/w prior 
sphincterotomy. No other abnormalities were noted.  

Bile duct: moderate amount of air bubbles were noted in the bile 
duct, obscuring view. The duct in the porta-hepatis was normal. 
 
Impression: Pancreas parenchyma and duct showed changes c/w 
chronic pancreatitis. Ampulla showed post sphincterotomy 
changes, but was otherwise normal.  Limited images of bile duct 
and pancreatic duct were normal.
 
Recommendations: Follow-up with Dr. ___ in pancreas clinic.
Return patient to hospital ward. 

IMPRESSION: 
1. Successful placement of a ___ ___ tube via the 
greater 
curvature of the stomach and into the proximal jejunum. Of note, 
duodenum and proximal jejunum are all to the right of the 
midline due to this patient's partial pancreatectomy. 
2. Due to excessive air received by the patient for gastric 
insufflation over the last two days as well as receiving 
glucagon, which causes an ileus, an ileus of at least 24 hours, 
should be expected. Hence, tube usage should not be carried out 
for at least 24 hours after which feeding should be advanced 
slowly as tolerated. 
3. Two T-fasteners in place, these should be cut at the skin in 
approximately 14 days.

1) Acute on chronic pancreatitis: There was no elevation of 
amylase and lipase initially, but her symptoms were consistant 
with her prior symptoms of acute pancreatitis. She had a 
sbft/ugi at the request of her gastroenterologist, Dr. ___, to 
r/o obstruction given h/o malrotation. This showed malrotation 
(known) but no acute functional abnormality. She then had an 
MRCP, which showed both hepatic and common bile duct dilation, 
but similar to prior imaging. She was evaluated by ERCP, but it 
was not thought that this would be helpful. She was treated 
symptomatically with iv dilaudid, ivf, and antiemetics. She was 
offered enteral feeding post-pyloric via dobhoff but declined 
this as she did not feel comfortable with the dobhoff. When 
restarting her oral diet she was recommended to have viokase 
with a ppi to replace pancreatic enzymes. Her pain regimen was 
changed to oral on ___, with addition of liquids. She had 
worsening of pain control with this. It is recommended that when 
she is able to tolerate food she take viokase with meals along 
with ppi or h2 blocker. After discussion of her case with Dr. 
___, her gastroenterologist, she warrants evaluation 
by Dr. ___ for consideration of repair of her 
malrotation, though her pain is not classically obstructive in 
nature, this will be done as an outpatient. She is also 
encouraged to undergo evaluation for spinal cord stimulation to 
help with pain control.  Anti TTG ab was 3 ___ normal range) 
and CRP was 1.8.

Unfortunately, she did not improve with oral diet.  After 
discussion with Dr. ___ on ___, she was initiated on TPN.  
PICC was placed, and TPN was initiated.  She then developed rt. 
UE edema and an u/s was done:

Final Report 
RIGHT UPPER EXTREMITY VENOUS ULTRASOUND 
  
INDICATION: ___ woman with pancreatitis, new right PICC 
line placed, 
presenting with new onset of right upper extremity edema. 
  
COMPARISON: Not available at the ___. 
  
FINDINGS: Gray-scale and color Doppler images of the right 
internal jugular, 
subclavian, axillary, brachial, and cephalic veins were 
obtained. There is a 
short segment of a nonocclusive thrombus in the right axillary 
vein. There is 
normal compressibility of the right internal jugular, 
subclavian, brachial, 
and cephalic veins. The right basilic PICC extends into the 
axillary, and 
subclavian vein. The right subclavian vein demonstrates 
decreased respiratory 
variability, which is due to combination of nonocclusive 
thrombus in the 
axillary vein as well as the presence of the intravenous 
catheter. 
  
IMPRESSION: Small nonocclusive thrombus in the right axillary 
vein. 
 
The picc line was removed and anticoagulation was initiated with 
unfractionated heparin and warfarin, transitioned to lovenox and 
warfarin with plans for conitinued outpatient monitoring of INR 
while undergoing lovenox bridge. 

She should be on lovenox until warfarin level therapeutic (___) 
for at least 48 hours.  Duration of anticoagulation to be 
determined by her primary MD, Dr. ___.

She was tolerating po diet (with abdominal pain, controlled by 
oral medications) on discharge and had stable vital signs.

pancreatitis attributed to biliary sludge, transferred from OSH 
for consideration of ERCP.

# recurrent acute pancreatitis: Has been previously attributed 
to biliary sludge s/p distant cholecystectomy and partial 
pancreatectomy. Currently there is no other clear etiology. Some 
prior notes have documented she has chronic pancreatitis, with 
last CT scan ___ reporting diffuse dilatation of the main 
pancreatic duct, but her overall clinical picture was not 
entirely consistent with chronic pancreatitis. CT scan of the 
abdomen was obtained and was unchanged from her last scan in 
___, which was when she was hospitalized for her last flare. 
She was clinically stable, tolerating clear liquid diet, but 
epigastric abdominal pain and nausea persisted. Case was 
discussed with ERCP team, who found no indication for another 
ERCP given clinical stability with unremarkable labs and 
unchanged CT scan. Given that EGD was unremarkable, pain 
attributed to her pancreas and she was started on pancreatic 
enzymes ___. She was started on a PPI. Her diet was advanced to 
clears ___ and regular low fat on ___. She will be following

prescribed zofran for nausea.

# epigastric pain: somewhat atypical location for pancreatitis. 
She remained stable with dilaudid for analgesia and zofran prn 
nausea. On ___ she had one episode of emesis, which was the 
first time she vomited since the onset of pain two weeks prior 
to admission. This was the only episode. Ddx included PUD/  
gastritis, especially in the setting of chronic NSAID use. She 
was started on PPI and given maalox prn dyspepsia. GI was 
consulted, and they recommended EGD. EGD on ___ was 
unremarkable. She was started on a PPI. Diet was advanced. See 
above.
.
#dyspnea/asthma-pt reported h.o asthma. After her EGD she felt 
SOB similar to prior asthma flares. She was not hypoxic, 
tachypneic nor did she have wheezing on exam. Symptoms improved

         PRESUMPTIVE IDENTIFICATION. 
Pansensitive.

AXR ___: Nonobstructive bowel gas pattern. No free air.

Abdominal CT ___:
1. Mild stranding adjacent to the distal aspect of the remaining 
pancreas, probably related to pancreatitis. There is no evidence 
of pseudocyst, fluid collection or pancreatic necrosis.  
2. Intra- and extra-hepatic bile duct dilation and pancreatic 
ductal dilation appears similar to the recent MRCP of ___, 
but these ducts are increased in caliber compared to the prior 
CTA of ___. This raises the possibility of papillary 
stenosis. 

___ EGD
Findings: Esophagus:  
 Mucosa: Normal mucosa was noted.  
Stomach:  
 Protruding Lesions A single 3mm polyp of benign appearance was 
found in the proximal stomach body. A cold forceps biopsy was 
performed for histology.  
Duodenum:  
 Mucosa: Normal mucosa was noted.  

Impression: Polyp in the proximal stomach body (biopsy)
Otherwise normal EGD to third part of the duodenum 

___ Pathology
Gastric proximal body, mucosal biopsy:
Body-type mucosa with focal mild chronic inflammation and a few 
dilated glands consistent with fundic gland polyp.

 
Brief Hospital Course:
1) Abdominal pain: Her presentation was felt most consistent 
with a pancreatitis flare, without rise in biochemical markers. 
Her symptoms improved without eating for several days and then 
worsened after trying to advance from clear to full liquids. She 
additionally reported nausea, which improved with empiric PPI 
therapy. Given her protracted symptoms, GI was consulted. A CT 
scan of the abdomen with pancreas protocol on ___ showed 
peripancreatic stranding and ducts similar in size to previous 
MRCP but dilated compared to previous CTA. An EGD was 
additionally performed, and did not disclose other pathology 
(polyp biopsied). In light of poor nutritional intake and 
failure to advance her diet, TPN was recommended. A PICC line 
was placed on (___). She tolerated the TPN and reached her goal 
per nutrition recommendations. She was discharged after cycling 
down her TPN to 18 hours, her goal at home was set to 12 hrs. 
She was setup with ___ for her TPN and will follow up with her 
PCP and GI within one week.

2) Asthma: Did not require treatment during this admission.

3) Depression: Stable, continued on citalopram

4) Hypothyroidism: Stable continued on levothyroxine 75mcg 
daily.

5) Tobacco abuse: Pt was started on NicoDerm Patch and will 
continue after discharge.

FINDINGS:  
  
CT ABDOMEN: 
Inflammatory change with associated gravitational atelectasis 
and 
bronchiolectasis is noted in the lower lobes bilaterally, 
greater on the 
right side. There is a 5-mm nodule identified laterally in the 
right lower 
lobe measuring 5 mm (series 3 image 11) which is likely 
reactive.  
  
No evidence for pneumoperitoneum.  
There is mild intrahepatic biliary dilatation predominantly 
within the right lobe, stable since prior CT in ___. There has 
been prior cholecystectomy.  
The main portal vein is patent. Common bile duct is dilated at 
the head of the pancreas measuring 12 mm (series 3 image 24) 
again stable when compared with prior imaging.  
There has been previous partial pancreatectomy, cholecystectomy 
and splenectomy. Splenule noted in the left upper quadrant. The 
pancreatic duct is uniformly dilated throughout the remainder of 
the pancreas measuring maximum 3 mm. No peripancreatic stranding 
or fluid to suggest active pancreatitis at this time. 
Unremarkable hepaticojejunostomy. The adrenal glands and kidneys 
are unremarkable.  
No retroperitoneal masses or adenopathy. 
  
CT PELVIS:  
The rectum and sigmoid colon are normal. The uterus is normal 
with an endometrial stripe cavity consistent with patient's age. 
No adnexal masses, no pelvic adenopathy or free fluid. No acute 
intra-abdominal abscess identified.  
  
  
CT OSSEOUS SKELETON:  
No osseous destructive lesion. 
  
IMPRESSION:  
  
1. The patient is status post partial pancreatectomy in ___. No 
evidence for acute pancreatitis or abscess.  
  
2. Inflammatory change noted in the right lower lobe 
.
CHEST (PA & LAT) Study Date of ___ 5:18 ___ 
IMPRESSION: PA and lateral chest compared to ___, 
and ___: 
  
Small bilateral pleural effusion is new since ___. Lungs are 
clear.  
Heart size normal. The pulmonary vasculature is more full today 
than it was on the previous study but not pathologically so, and 
mediastinal veins are not dilated. Left PIC line has been 
removed.

 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ woman with a history of chronic pancreatitis. She is 
presenting with symptoms similar to her prior episodes. Found to 
have rising WBC up to 32.2 on ___nd he 
was presumptively treated with IV metronidazole for c difficile 
but patient had no diarrhea and had CT abdomen which showed 
biliary dilatation which was stable. WCC resolved by ___ during 
stay and found to have GPCs on BCs later found to be 
pan-sensitive coagulase -negative staph. Patient was started on 
IV vancomycin ___ and PICC pulled as this was the likely source 
of infection. IV metronidazole was stopped as c difficile toxin 
-negative x3. Patient had a fever ___ to 101.1F and none further 
and no further positive BC with otherwise negative infection 
screen. PICC replaced ___ for home IV antibiotics as normal WCC 
and afebrile. Patient began to start eating and by the day prior 
to discharge was eating solids without significant pain or 
vomiting. Dietitian recommended supplements with Ensure and the 
patient was discharged on ___.
.  
# Chronic Pancreatitis: This was felt to represent on of her 
normal pancreatitis flares with  tender abdomen without guarding 
or rebound tenderness. Patient was treated initially with IV 
dilaudid, IV compazine for mild nausea without vomiting and TPN 
until blood cultures were positive at which point her PICC was 
removed. On the day after admission, her WCC rose to 32.2 and IV 
metronidazole was presumptively started for possible c 
difficile. She proceeded to a CXR which showed no free air and a 
CT which showed stable biliary dilatation and no acute process. 
She had no symptoms and latterly this was felt to be reactive to 
her bacteremia in the setting of asplenism. Her WCC resolved to 
normal after commencing IV vancomycin for her coagulase negative 
staph bacteremia. Patient had a fever of 101.1F on ___ and a 
septic screen was negative. She had no further fevers. Patient 
was eating better ___ and nausea was under control and CXR shows 
tiny effusions and some pulmonary vascular congestion at which 
point IV fluids were stopped and did not require re-institution. 
PICC was inserted ___ after afebrile and normal WCC for home IV 
antibiotics. We tapered down her dilaudid and by ___ was 
tolerating her home oral regimen. Patient was discharged home 
with laxatives on her home dilaudid dose on ___. She was 
reviewed by dietitian who recommended supplementation with 
Ensure which she will purchase. She will see her PCP ___ ___ and 
has a gastroenterology appointment on ___. Her antibiotics will 
finish on ___.
.
# CoNS Bacteremia due to line infection: GPCs in 3 sets of BCs 
from PICC ___ and ___ which grew pan-sensitive coagulase 
negative staphylococci. This was felt likely secondary to a line 
infection in the setting of TPN via her PICC which did not 
appear cellulitic on admission. She remained stable and appeared 
well other than pain throughout her hospital stay. Echo on 
___ was normal with no vegetations. She was started on IV 
vancomycin (due to initial concern for MRSA) on ___ and this was 
continued despite pan-sensitive isolates given preferable dosing 
frequency and previous hemolytic anemia with cephalosporins. 
Patient had a fever of 101.1F on ___ and a septic screen was 
negative. She had no further fevers. PICC was inserted ___ after 
afebrile and normal WCC for home IV antibiotics. She had a low 
vancomycin level on ___ and dose was increased to 1250mg bid 
however she had high levels on this dose of 21.8 and 27.2 (on 
the day of discharge) and her dose was decreased back to 1g bid. 
Pharmacy latterly felt that her vancomycin level may rise given 
the trend on ___ and would consider repeat Chem 7/vancomycin 
level to assess renal function and vancomycin level in light of 
possible vancomycin accumulation. A message was left for her PCP 
who will see her on ___. She was discharged home on ___ and 
her IV vancomycin will continue until ___.
.
# Malnutrition, mod: Patient was initially receiving TPN in the 
community but given PICC line infection her PICC was removed and 
she was started on IV fluids and kept NPO. Outpatient plan was 
to wean TPN in community and trial eating and if failed to 
consider Jej tube placement. Patient slowly advanced her diet 
and by ___ was eating better and nausea was under control. She 
advanced her diet to full regular on ___ and she tolerated this. 
She will trial a normal oral diet in the community but if this 
fails she may have to consider J-tube placement given the fact 
that this is her second PICC line infection. She was seen by 
dietitian on the day of discharge who recommended supplemental 
Ensure which she will purchase.
.
# Constipation: Patient was constipated and we started senna, 
docusate and PRN miralax, lactulose and suppositories which was 
effective. She was informed to continue these as needed in the 
community.
.
# Leukocytosis: WBC rose to 32.2 precipitously on ___. Patient 
had one episode of loose stools on the day prior to admission 
and had none further. There was no colitis on CT to suggest c 
difficile and patient was presumptively treated with IV 
metronidazole which was stopped after the clinical picture was 
not in keeping with this and the first c difficile toxin was 
negative. The leukocytosis resolved and was 7.7 on discharge. 
Leukocytosis was likely reactive given bacteremia and asplenic 
state. 
.
# Elevated LFTs: Developed a new mild transaminitis up to max 
ALT 65 AST 101 with otherwise normal LFTs after commencement of 
antibiotics. Biliary dilatation on CT abdomen was at baseline. 
LFTs fluctuated and one point normalised. Still mild elevation 
on discharge. This was felt likely due to her antibiotics. LFTs 
should be rechecked in 1 week by her PCP in addition to Chem 7 
given IV vancomycin therapy.
.

Discharge Instructions:
It was a plleasure taking care of you during your stay at the 
___. You presented with a flar 
eof your chronic pancreatitis. You were treated with IV dilaudid 
(hydromorphone) for your pain and anti-nausea drugs for your 
nausea. We also found evidence of a blood infection of your PICC 
line after some bacteria grew on blood cultures taken from your 
line. The infection was causes by a bacteria called a "coagulase 
negative staphylococcus" which is a common organism on your skin 
and for this you were treated with IV vancomycin and your PICC 
line was removed. You had a high white blood cell count which we 
think was due to this bacterial infection. We briefly treated 
you with another antibiotic called metronidazole for possible C 
difficile (a bacterial infection of the gut which causes prifuse 
diarrhea and is generally associated with recent antibiotic use) 
but you were NOT found to have this after tests came back 
negative. Your high white cell count resolved  and was likely 
due to your blood infection. You will continue treatment for 
your blood infection with home IV antibiotic therapy with 
vancomycin until ___. You had a new PICC line placed for 
this. Your pain improved and you were able to be sent home with 
your home dilaudid dose. You were managing solid foods and were 
sent home on a regular diet however if this does not work out 
you may require a jejunostomy tube in the future for feeding. 
You were seen by the dietitian on the day of discharge who 
recommended dietary supplementation with Ensure which you can 
buy at your supermarket.
You have an appointment to see your PCP ___ ___ and your 
gastroenterologist on ___.
