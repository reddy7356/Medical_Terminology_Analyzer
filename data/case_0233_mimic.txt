Brief Hospital Course:
SUMMARY
=======
Ms. ___ is a ___ female with a history of gastroparesis, 
history of eating disorder, SIBO, GERD and G-tube placed 
initially in ___ who presented for worsening abdominal pain, 
increased stool
output and inability to tolerate PO. She underwent ___ evaluation 
conversion of enteral access from G tube to G-J tube. Her pain 
and stool output were treated symptomatically and she improved. 
Nutrition evaluated her and made recommendations regarding tube 
feedings at home. She was discharged home in good condition with 
follow-up by interventional radiology and gastroenterology.

ACUTE ISSUES:
=============
#Acute on Chronic Diarrhea
#Gastroparesis
#Enteral access
Ms. ___ state she has been doing well for the past few years
and in the past 6 weeks has had increased diarrhea from her
baseline diarrhea and increased nausea. She reached out to her
outpatient gastroenterologist late last week to discuss her
symptoms. Appears as though her inability to tolerate PO became
more severe last week, at which time she was using her g-tube 
for hydration
iso significant diarrhea. Pt she did not note any inciting event 
for
sudden onset of symptoms. No known sick contacts in the past 
week, no documented fevers here. Does not feel g-tube is 
malfunctioned
but that perhaps her gastroparesis has worsened iso eating
whatever she wants over the past year and more recently. It is 
possible that she has had worsening of gastroparesis (though 
unclear
why this would cause increased stool output or her symptoms) or
perhaps flare of her SIBO. She was worked up and infectious 
etiology was thought to to be less likely given no leukocytosis, 
no left shift, no sick contacts, no fevers documented on 
admission. She has no history of IBS or colitis, no bloody 
stool, no urgency otherwise. Interventional radiology converted 
her G-tube with a GJ tube. Home omeprazole was continued. She 
received pain control with Tylenol and 1 dose of IV Dilaudid. 
She received loperamide as needed for diarrhea. Scheduled for 
follow-up with GI as outpatient and connected her with 
interventional radiology follow-up. Nutrition was consulted for 
recommendations regarding need for tube feeds and recommended 
Isosource 1.5 (full recommendations under diet info).

History of Present Illness:
Ms. ___ is a ___ y/o F with a history of gastroparesis s/t 
eating disorder who presents with abdominal pain x 5 days in the 
setting of multiple G tube replacements. 

She had a G tube for venting and an NJ tube for nutrition placed 
this past ___, and was tolerating this well until 6 days 
PTA, when a hole developed in the lining of the G tube tubing. 
She went to ___ where they replaced the G tube 
with a Foley. 5 days PTA she started developing abdominal pain 
(constant, dull, worse with movement) and the Foley ended up 
"falling out." It was discovered that the balloon of the Foley 
had burst and a new Foley was placed. She continued to have pain 
before presenting to the ED today. 

She states pain is similar to when her prior GJ tubes have 
"flipped" and failed. Also of note had vomiting 1 day PTA in 
which her NJ tube coiled in her throat and she self dc'ed it. 
There is some serosang discharge from the G tube site but no 
pus. 

ROS positive for nausea and vomiting (patient states this is not 
abnormal for her) and constipation but negative for 
fevers/chills/sweats, SOB, trouble breathing, dysuria. 

The pain is relieved by dilaudid (patient has tried morphine and 
vicodin before; morphine gives her a rash and vicodin is 
effective but not as potent as the dilaudid). Of note, she is 
scheduled for replacement of a new brand of GJ tube 3 days from 
now. At baseline she can tolerate all liquids without vomiting 
and can tolerate pureed foods. 

In the ED VS were 97.6 54 105/69 16 100%. She as given IV 
dilaudid and NS fluids before being transferred to the floor for

Given that the patient had a h/o gastroparesis and presented 
with increased abdominal pain in the setting of multiple 
reinsertions of tubes to her G tube site, the differential 
included irritation from multiple insertions vs. gastroparesis 
flare vs. infection at site. Infection was not likely given her 
lack of WBC count, the fact that she was afebrile, and lack of 
erythema, fluctuance, or purulent drainage at the G tube site on 
skin exam. Other etiologies (ie pancreatitis, pregnancy, UTI) 
were ruled out by relatively normal UA, normal lipase, and 
negative hcg. 

For pain control, the patient was put on oral dilaudid while in 
house with decrease in pain the following day. She was 
rehydrated with IV fluids and given a pureed diet to eat. The 
day after admission the improved with decreased pain and was 
able to tolerate oral intake of the pureed foods with minimal 
nausea and no vomiting. She was deemed safe for discharge, 
especially given the fact that she had an already scheduled GJ 
tube reinsertion 2 days later. She was discharged on 2 days 
worth of vicodin for pain control.

adderall, clonazepam, lithium, and trazadone.

Brief Hospital Course:
___ with ___ notable for gastroparesis (currently with G-tube 
and NJ tube), eating disorder in remission, history of SIBO 
(previously treated with rifaximin), and bipolar disorder on 
lithium who presents with acute on chronic abdominal pain of 
similar character to the pain she was admitted for 
___ that was found to be ___ gastroperesis and 
dizziness on exertion.

ACTIVE ISSUES:
==============
# Abdominal pain:
This abdominal pain is of the same character of her chronic 
abdominal pain that has actutely worsened. On exam, her abdomen 
was non-acute. KUB showed no evidence of obstruction of her NJ 
or G tube and provided no explanation for her abdominal pain. 
Etiology is unclear given her NJ tube bypasses her stomach and 
she is not taking PO, which makes gastroparesis unlikely.  
Infectious etiology is unlikely given that she was 
hemodynamically stable without nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea. 
IBD is unlikely given no family or personal history of IBD and 
she has no symptoms or signs. NJ tube is functioning without 
evidence of obstruction per patient and patient tolerated 
restarting of tube feeds per NJ tube at 50ccs/hour for 15 hours 
QHS with minimal nausea. Her pain was managed with 2mg dilaudid 
PO with PO benadryl 30 minutes prior, standing acetaminophen, 
and PRN ibuprofen. Her dilaudid was stopped on ___ in order 
to avoid its paralytic effects on the GI tract, lowering of her 
blood pressure, and prevent long-term dependence.  Nausea was 
managed with IV odansetron, which was transitioned to PO prior 
to discharge.

# Episodic hypotension:
Pt's dizziness and confusion on exertion is most likely due to 
dehydration due to poor PO intake despite NJ tube placement. 
Because of her past history with hypotension after morphine, 
this was not given. Her blood pressures were near baseline at 
___ with ___ episodes of ___, during which she was 
asymptomatic. This resolved with increased PO hydration and was 
likely related to poor PO intake.
 
CHRONIC ISSUES:
==============
# Eating Disorder: 
Her baseline weight is around 127 lbs and she denies a goal 
weight that her eating disorder team has agreed upon. She has 
been seeing Dr. ___ weekly weights and her dietitian, 
___, monthly.  The patient did not feel that her eating 
disorder was contributing to her current presentation.  

# Bipolar Disorder: 
Continued lithium.
  
# GERD: 
Continued omeprazole.  

# ADHD: 
Held Adderall per patient.  

# Hypothyroidism: 
Continued levothyroxine

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
====================
# Given recent increase in use of opioids over the past several 
months, she was discharged with no opioids and it is suggested 
that there be a high threshold for providing them given 
potential for dependence. Benadryl was given PO instead of IV to 
avoid associated euphoria with combined IV benadryl and 
dilaudid. 
# Follow-up with PCP and eating disorder care team (therapist, 
dietition, psychiatrist, and PCP) to develop outpatient plan for 
treating abdominal pain.
# GI follow-up is scheduled to address ___ tube and chronic 
abdominal pain
# Emergency contact: ___ ___ (mother)
# Code: Full (confirmed)

Discharge Instructions:
Ms. ___,

It was a pleasure to care for you during your hospitalization at 
___.

You were admitted for abdominal pain. We got an xray picture of 
your abdomen, which showed your NJ tube and G tube in the 
correct place with no clear evidence of obstruction. For the 
pain, we gave you tylenol (acetaminophen) and dilaudid 
(hydromorphone) by mouth with benadryl 30 minutes before to help 
with itching. We stopped the dilaudid on ___ out of concern 
for its negative effects on your GI tract (slowing it down), 
blood pressures, and to minimize dependence. For these reasons, 
we are not sending you home with opioids like dilaudid 
(hydromorphone).

For your nausea, we gave you zofran (ondansetron). Since you 
were feeling lightheaded, likely from not eating enough, we gave 
you IV fluids. We restarted your tube feeds at approximately the 
same rate you were having them at home (50 mls/hour for around 
15 hours), which you tolerated with minimal nausea. We also 
allowed you to eat by mouth, which you did with minimal nausea 
and no vomiting.

We have touched base with your PCP to discuss your 
hospitalization and you have a GI appointment in the near future 
(see below).

-Your ___ care team

FINDINGS:  Initial scout AP view of the abdomen demonstrates 
gastrojejunostomy tube coiled in the stomach.  Following the 
hand injection of Gastrografin through the patient's 
percutaneous gastrojejunostomy tube, contrast material is noted 
in the stomach as well as in the proximal duodenum.  A third AP 
view of the abdomen demonstrates contrast moving distally 
throughout the remainder of the duodenum.  There are clips noted 
in the left upper quadrant.  There is a nonspecific bowel gas 
pattern with no evidence of obstruction.
IMPRESSION:  The gastrojejunostomy tube again appears coiled in 
the stomach with the tip located at the fundus of the stomach.

Brief Hospital Course:
___ yo F with hx of eating disorder s/p GJ tube placement, 
bipolar disorder, GERD, gastroparesis who presents with 
abdominal pain found to have GJ tube coiled in her stomach. 

# Abdominal Pain - most likely related to malpositioned GJ tube 
as demonstrated on imaging. She was given IV narcotics in the ED 
and pain was subsequently treated with with tylenol and oral 
oxycodone on the floor. Given that patient has had similar 
problems in the past, both ___ and surgery were consulted to 
discuss alternative options. Ultimately after discussion with 
the patient, ___, and surgery, the decision was made to place a 
dobhoff post pyloric and exchange her GJ tube for a G tube. She 
tolerated the procedure well. She was discharged with plans to 
follow up with her surgeon Dr. ___ to discuss J tube 
placement and with her GI physician.

Chief Complaint:
early satiety and weight loss
 
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Postpyloric Dophoff tube placement

 
History of Present Illness:
___ yo F with h/o anorexia nervosa and bulemia with laxative 
abuse presents with reflux, nausea/vomiting and nearly 30 lb 
weight loss over the past year. She is followed by Dr. ___ 
___ of ___, with recent delayed gastric emptying study 
on ___. Today she was direct admitted by Dr. ___ 
further workup and treatment of her nausea, vomiting and 
gastroparesis.  
.  
The patient states that she suffered from an eating disorder for 
a period of seven to ___ years. She was bulimic at first and 
then proceeded to restrict. She states for the last number of 
years her symptoms have been under good control until one year 
ago, at which point she started to experience GERD and 
regurgitation, both of which have increased over the last year. 
6 months ago, symptoms progressed to early satiety, food 
aversion, and postprandial nausea and vomiting. At this point, 
she has reflux if she bends over to tie shoes. 2 weeks ago, her 
postprandial vomiting became acutely worse. Her PO intake has 
dropped off, and for the past 3 days she has only been able to 
tolerate small amounts of clear liquids (gatorade, diluted apple 
juice, water). She feels dizzy with blackouts in her vision when 
standing; has not passed out but feels that she might. Her 
weight has decreased from 160 lbs to 133 lbs over the past year. 
Has noticed decreased UOP recently. Denies chest pain, 
palpitations. Has been to the ED multiple times in the past 2 
weeks for these problems, but has been discharged home after IV 
fluids due to normal labs. Has been prescribed Zofran for 
nausea, which helps at first but ultimately cannot prevent the 
vomiting. She has seen several physicians, one of whom suggested 
that she might have gastroparesis, but did not confirm this with 
a gastric emptying study. She is now followed by Dr. ___ 
___ at ___, who did gastric emptying study on ___ 
which showed delayed gastric emptying from ___ hours. Per 
patient, Dr. ___ PCP ___ been debating 
whether to start TPN but decided not to do so at this point due 
to concern for refeeding syndrome, which pt has had in past. 
Also per patient, Dr. ___ stated that she will likely 
have postpyloric feeding tube placed during this admission.  
.  
Second problem is that of change of bowel habits. A year ago, 
she started to have alternating diarrhea and constipation, 
although this is now quite constipation predominant. She had a 
normal colonoscopy in the past and was diagnosed with IBS. She 
has had two recent emergency visits to ___ for 
constipation and generalized abdominal pain. She is currently on 
amitiza and rifaximin for IBS as prescribed by Dr. ___. Was 
on lactulose previously but stopped because has h/o laxative 
abuse and found the diarrhea distressing. Has also been on 
dicyclomine (bentyl) in the past with little effect. Last night 
she took enema which helped somewhat.  
.  
On the floor, vitals are T 97.7 BP 116/77 P 72 RR 18 SaO2 99% 
RA. She currently does not have nausea ___ pain, but feels 
this is because she has not attempted to eat recently. Complains 
of exhaustion and lightheadedness.

without hydronephrosis or stones. The pancreas and spleen are 
unremarkable. The aorta is normal in caliber, and the visualized 
portions of the inferior vena cava appear normal. The stomach is 
completely empty as well as the duodenal sweep. Neither show any

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ is a ___ year old woman with a history of bulimia NOS 
and bipolar disease who reports a ___ month h/o post-prandial 
abdominal pain, early satiety and nausea and vomiting that has 
increased in severity over the last month that is likely due to 
delayed gastric emptying.
.
# Post-prandial pain, nausea and vomiting: Ms. ___ has been 
experiencing post-prandial pain early satiety, nausea and 
vomiting for the last ___ months that has increased in severity 
in the last month and led to a 30 pound weight loss ___ 
pounds in the last month). A gastric emptying study on ___ 
demonstrated delayed gastric emptying with 22% of ingested 
activity remaining in the stomach at 4 hours. She was directly 
admitted by her gastroenterologist Dr. ___ on ___ 
to rule out Superior Mesenteric Artery Syndrome as a cause for 
delayed gastric emptying and for the initiation of post-pyloric 
tube feeds with the intention of bridging to small liquid and 
solid foods as tolerated. Abdominal US on ___ showed no 
evidence of gastric or duodenal dilatation, abnormal flow 
velocities or SMA syndrome. Since she was able to ingest 
liquids, a trial of small liquid meals was made on ___, but 
Ms. ___ continued to experience early satiety and vomiting 
after a few spoonfuls of soup and apple juice. Patient was 
placed on IV Zofran every eight hours to help decrease nausea, 
with encouragement to take Zofran before attempting ingest a 
meal. A feeding tube was placed on the floor and advanced the 
post-pyloric position by interventional radiology. Tube feeds of 
Isosource 1.5 @ were started at 10ml/hr and slowly advanced to 
goal of 90 cc/hour cycled feeds. After enteral nutrition was 
initiated patient reported experiencing less nausea, 
post-prandial pain, and no vomiting. She continued to experience 
early satiety after ingesting liquids such as of ___ ice, 
apple juice and ginger ale. IV erythromycin q8 hours was started 
to increase gastric motility, but this caused increased nausea 
and had to be discontinued. Per Dr. ___, she had a 
psychiatry consult to rule out eating disorder as a contributing 
factor to her early satiety and food aversion.  Psychiatry 
consult found that her symptoms were atypical for anorexia, more 
likely related to delayed gastric emptying. Noted that Lithium 
can cause nausea and anorexia and may be exacerbating her 
symptoms, but did not recommend discontinuation as Lithium has 
been very helpful to patient. They recommended outpatient 
biofeedback to help assess whether anxiety is present 
surrounding meals and to help manage this issue. Inpatient 
Gastroenterology was then consulted. They recommended starting 
Metaclopramide in the short term as a prokinetic agent, as 
tardive dyskinesia is a very uncommon side effect (<1%) of this 
med and usually only occurs after long-term use. She was placed 
on metaclopramide 5mg 30 min before meals and at bedtime, and 
was discharged on this regimen. As an outpatient, patient will 
be bridged to the prokinetic agent Domperidone, which will be 
ordered and obtained by Dr. ___. Also recommended increasing 
omeprazole to 20 mg BID to increase gastric secretions and help 
gastric emptying, and stopping rifaximin as pt has no objective 
evidence of bacterial overgrowth. Recommended restarting Zofran 
as an outpatient as this has been helpful to patient in past. GI 
also recommended holding tube feeds at this point to stimulate 
patient's appetite, and starting small, frequent, low-fat meals. 
Patient tolerated this change in diet. She will have home ___ 
for DHT flushing and possible future tube feeds, and will follow 
up closely with her nutritionist (appointment in 3 days). 

Ms. ___ vitals, electrolytes, and physical exam was closely 
monitored for signs of refeeding syndrome. Thiamin and a 
multi-vitamin were given daily. Ms. ___ did not show any 
signs of volume overload or kwasiorkor. Her potassium, 
magnesium, calcium, and phosphorus were stable throughout her 
hospital stay.  
.
# Constipation:Ms. ___ has a long standing history of 
intermittent constipation and diarrhea that is likely due to her 
 disordered eating behavior and IBS. She has been placed on a 
bowel regimen of Amitiza, Rifaximin and Lactulose by Dr. 
___. She was constipated during the first four days of 
admission, followed by two days of loose stool. Senna and 
Docusate Sodium were discontinued once she began having loose 
stools. This change in bowel habits is likely multifactorial and 
secondary to her IBS and history of disordered eating behavior. 
Of note, patients who are refeeding after periods of anorexia 
can experience diarrhea due to altered bowel flora and atrophied 
intestinal mucosa. Per GI recs, her amitiza and rifaximin were 
discontinued as she does not have any objective evidence of 
bacteria overgrowth. 
.
# Dizziness: on admission, patient complained of dizziness and 
tunnel vision when she stands up after lying down for long 
periods of time. She was mildly orthostatic on arrival to the 
hospital. This was all secondary to her malnutrition and volume 
depletion. After maintenence fluids and then starting tube 
feeds, her dizziness and lightheadedness resolved. 
.
# History of anorexia with laxative use and purging: Ms. ___ 
has history of eating disordered behavior for several years, 
requiring several hospitalizations and occasional tube feeding. 
She describes a great improvement in her body image and sense of 
appropriate weight over the past year. She is eager to regain 
her strength and appetite. We spoke with her extensively about 
this during hospitalization, and psychiatry saw her as well. Do 
not feel that eating disorder has been significantly 
contributing to her current condition. 
.
# Bipolar disorder: Ms. ___ has been diagnosed with bipolar 
disease. We continued her home psychiatric medications (Lithium 
1200, Buproprion 50, Trazadone 25, Clonezepam 1 mg BID). 
Although Buproprion is known to lower the seizure threshold and 
is often avoided in patients with eating disorders, it was 
decided to continue it because of the low dose and because she 
had been stable on this medication for at least six months. 
Psychiatry was consulted and agreed with this assessment.

Imaging:
-G/J tube check (___): FINDINGS: Two AP supine views of the 
abdomen were obtained prior to and after the injection of 
Gastrografin through the patient's existing percutaneous 
gastrojejunostomy tube. On the scout view, oral contrast 
material is also seen within the transverse and left and sigmoid 
colon.  These images demonstrate the tip of the catheter to lie 
within the distal stomach, likely at the level of the pylorus, 
with oral contrast opacifying both the stomach and proximal 
duodenum.   No extraluminal oral contrast is identified.  A clip 
is demonstrated within the left upper quadrant.  There is no 
evidence of bowel obstruction. 
  
IMPRESSION:  Percutaneous gastrojejunostomy tube tip appears to 
be in 
unchanged position, terminating within the region of the 
pylorus. 

-G/J tube replacement (___): Initial scout images 
demonstrated existing GJ tube looping in the stomach, but its 
distal tip in second to third portion of the duodenum.  Small 
amount of contrast was injected to sasses the position of the 
tip of the tube.  A ___ wire was then placed through the 
tube and with its tip in the duodenum, the balloon was deflated 
and then the tube was removed.  Alongside this ___ wire, an 
additional ___ wire through the 5 ___ Kumpe catheter was 
then navigated into the duodenum distally.  The ___ wire was 
then exchanged for Amplatz wire and the Kumpe catheter was then 
exchanged for sheath.  The Amplatz wire was then exchanged for a 
stiff Glidewire.  The sheath was then removed and 16 ___ 
regular profile MIC GJ tube was then placed over the wire.  The 
balloon was inflated with 7 cc of very diluted contrast.  
Contrast injections through both ports demonstrated
opacification of distal jejunum and stomach is appropriate.  The 
wires were
removed.  The balloon was inflated in the stomach.  Sterile 
dressings were
applied. 
The patient tolerated the procedure well.  No immediate 
post-procedure
complications were noted.
 
IMPRESSION:  Successful placement of GJ tube with a new 16 
___ MIC GJ tube.
 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ h/o eating disorder and gastroparesis s/p G/J tube exchange 
3 days PTA who presents with abdominal pain.  
  
# Abdominal pain: Thought to be related to her recent J/G tube 
change, she has had significant pain after this procedure in the 
past.  At admission, the J portion of her G/J tube was noted to 
be located in the stomach.  ___ was consulted who recommended 
replacing the tube for one with a longer J portion, although 
they cautioned that there is still a chance that this tube will 
also become misplaced into the stomach.  She underwent the tube 
change on ___ which was uneventful.  She was discharged home 
in good condition.  The new tube was easily flushed with water 
prior to discharge with no discomfort.  Her tube feeds were held 
this admission prior to the tube change, she will resume these 
at home.  She reports that she gets the majority of her 
nutrition through the G/J tube with only small amounts of PO 
intake.  She received PO and occasional IV Dilaudid for pain 
control this admission.
  
# Bipolar disorder : She was continued on her home lithium and 
clonazepam.  
  
# Gastroparesis: Thought to be secondary to her prior eating 
disorder and laxative abuse, she is followed by Dr. ___ 
GI.  ___ was continued on her home doses of domperidone and 
Zofran.

# H/o eating d/o: Appears to be in remission. As above, TF were 
held initially until her tube was changed.  At discharge, she 
will continue her home tube feeds.  Electrolytes were monitored 
daily without significant abnormalities.
  
# H/o laxative abuse and chronic constipation: She was on 
Miralax at home, which was contnued this admission.

# Code status this admission: FULL

Brief Hospital Course:
___ y/o woman with gastroparesis, eating disorder, here with 
Dobhoff tube in stomach, and it is supposed to be in duodenum.

1.  Nutrition:  She went for ___ procedure to advance Dobhoff 
tube past the duodenum but it was not successful.  The Dobhoff 
tube was removed, and she tolerated food by mouth.  She was 
scheduled to return for ___ conversion of her G tube to her GJ 
tube and will resume tube feeds at that time, as she says that

Brief Hospital Course:
This is a ___ year old female with past medilal history of eating 
disorder, gastroparesis s/p G-tube placement admitted ___ 
with LUQ pain and nausea similar to prior episodes of 
gastroparesis, tolerating slow advancing of diet, maintaining 
appropriate hydration/nutrition, ready for discharge.

# Left Upper Quadrant Abdominal pain / Gastroparesis / 
Constipation - patient admitted with several days of LUQ pain, 
progressive, associated with nausea.  She reported 1 episode 
diarrhea and ___ episode emesis.  Reported similar to prior 
episodes of gastroparesis.  Nausea and vomiting quickly 
resolved, but patient reported significant pain with any PO 
intake, even small amounts of liquids.  Patient seen by primary 
gastroenterologist, who felt that these residual symptoms were 
not likely to be gastroparesis, and more likely to be related to 
adjusting the stretch of using her stomach after a prolonged 
period of not eating.  Longitudinally there has been a concern 
for potential behavioral component to her concerns, especially 
given report of prior eating disorder.  During this admission, 
given reported pain, patient very focused on re-obtaining 
jejunal access (in the past she has had a GJ tube as well as a 
NJ tube, and is now awaiting her G tube to be converted back to 
a GJ tube).  Per my discussion with primary GI doctor, prior 
jejunal access did not result in decreased pain and patient 
would infrequently utilize.  As a result, jejunal access does 
not appear to be an appropriate therapy for her at this time.  
Over course of admission, diet was advanced and patient was 
weaned from IV medications.  Course complicated by constipation 
which resolved with miralax.  Of note, given that opiate 
medications could worsen potential gastroparesis they were not 
used for pain control during this admission. At discharge, 
patient demonstrate an ability to safely maintain 
hydration/nutrition status.  Patient able to be discharged home. 
 Continued home gabapentin, metaxalone, miralax.

# Anxiety / Bipolar - continue home clonazepam, Lithium 
Carbonate, trazodone

# Hypothyroidism - continued home Levothyroxine 

# GERD - continued home omeprazole 

# Migraines - continued home sumatriptan prn

 GI was consulted in ED and in the AM she was taken for EGD with 
MAC for NJ tube placement, which was uneventful.  She was 
advised to stay for initiation of J-tube feeds to ensure she was 
tolerating them; however, it was her strong preference to go 
home.  Given that she was familiar with tube feedings from a 
prior J tube and that she had close GI follow-up scheduled, she 
was discharged home.  

# Hypotension: 
On the morning of ___, the patient had an asymptomatic episode 
of relative hypotension to the ___ (her baseline is ___ 
systolic), but she was not tachycardic and was not symptomatic.  
This was likely in the setting of dehydration and receiving 
morphine in the ED.  She improved to the ___ systolic with 1L 
NS.  

CHRONIC ISSUES:
===============
  
# Eating Disorder: 
Weight loss seems to be ___ worsening gastroparesis. Recent 
weight loss approx 15 lbs. (baseline weight unclear). She has 
been seeing Dr. ___ weekly weights and her dietitian, 
___, monthly.  The patient did not feel that her eating 
disorder was contributing to her current presentation.  

# Bipolar Disorder: 
Continued lithium.
  
# GERD: 
Continued omeprazole.  

# ADHD: 
Continued Adderall.  

# Hypothyroidism: 
Continued levothyroxine.

  
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
====================
- Patient hypotensive to the ___ thought to be due to 
dehydration and morphine - morphine and other opiates should be 
used only with caution in the future
- Given that she had no tachycardic response with hypotension to 
the ___ systolic, the possibility of autonomic dysfunction as 
one possible etiology for her gastroparesis was raised.  If 
indicated, she could be considered for further autonomic workup 
as an outpatient.
- Patient had an NJ tube placed during this admission and will 
need to initiate tube feeds as an outpatient

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___, 

It was our pleasure caring for you at ___ 
___.  You were admitted to the hospital with nausea 
and vomiting.  Because you have also been losing weight, your 
outpatient gastroenterologist felt that you would benefit from 
re-placing a nasojejunal tube (or "NJ tube") so that you can 
continue tube feeds and support your nutrition.  Our 
gastroenterologists placed this tube, and you can resume your 
normal tube feeds through this when you go home.

Your blood pressure was also low while you were here - we think 
this happened because you were dehydrated, so we gave you fluids 
through the IV.  You also received two medicines in the 
emergency room, morphine and benadryl, which can contribute to 
low blood pressure.  If you are feeling dizzy or not able to 
keep down liquids when you get home, you should call your 
primary care doctor.  You will need close follow-up to ensure 
that your nutritional status is improving.

Thank you for allowing us to participate in your care.
 
Followup Instructions:
