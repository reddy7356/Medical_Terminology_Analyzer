Imaging:
========
Full spine XRAY AP and Lateral
FINDINGS: 
  
CERVICAL SPINE: Unremarkable soft tissues. The lung apices are 
clear. Patent airway. Normal prevertebral soft tissues. Normal 
alignment. Normal 
vertebral bodies and disc spaces. 
  
THORACIC SPINE: Limited lateral view due to motion and overlying 
soft tissue and bony structures. No compression fractures. No 
degenerative changes.  Loss of kyphosis which may be positional. 
Visualized intrathoracic structures are unremarkable. 
  
LUMBAR SPINE: ___ bowel gas pattern which obscures 
the bony 
detail of the sacrum. The visualized SI joints are within normal 
limits.  
Bilateral hip joint space narrowing. Five ___ vertebral 
bodies are present. Normal vertebral body heights and disc 
spaces. Normal alignment. 
  
IMPRESSION: No acute abnormality. 

MRI SPINE:
----------
FINDINGS: Many of the axial sequences are ___, 
despite having
been repeated. The study is compared with the radiography 
obtained ___.
  
The sagittal STIR sequences are unremarkable, with no pathologic 
paraspinal
soft tissue, including ligamentous, bone marrow or spinal cord 
focus of
hyperintensity. Incidentally noted T1- and ___ 
___
lesion centered ___ the L3 vertebral body, is likely a cavernous 
hemangioma.
The spinal cord is normal ___ caliber and intrinsic signal 
intensity through
the conus medullaris, which is normal ___ morphology and 
intrinsic signal
intensity, and terminates at the ___ level. Noted is 
desiccation of the
___ through ___ discs, with only mild bulging and no focal 
herniation or
spinal canal or neural foraminal compromise. The thoracic 
intervertebral
discs are maintained ___ height and signal intensity without 
significant bulge or focal herniation.
 
Noted is degeneration of the lumbar intervertebral discs. This 
is most marked at the ___ level, where there is a large right 
paracentral/proximal foraminal disc extrusion, measuring up to 8 
(AP) x 11 mm (TRV). This occupies the entire right subarticular 
zone and markedly indents the right anterolateral aspect of the 
thecal sac, signficantly displacing and impinging upon 
___ traversing right L5 nerve root. There may be 
impingement upon more caudal traversing nerve roots as well, but 
no overall spinal canal stenosis. There is no significant right 
neural foraminal stenosis or impingement upon the exiting right 
L4 nerve root. There is degeneration of the ___ disc with a 
right paracentral and eccentric bulge to the right;however, 
there is no significant spinal canal or neural foraminal 
stenosis at this level. There is also desiccation of the ___ 
and ___ discs with only mild bulging, of no apparent 
significance.
 
Following contrast administration, there is no pathologic 
paraspinal or
epidural soft tissue, leptomeningeal, intramedullary or 
radicular focus of
enhancement.
 
Incidentally noted is lobulated mucosal thickening with 
___ cyst formation involving the left maxillary 
sinus, incompletely imaged.
 
IMPRESSION:
1. ___: Disc degeneration with large right paracentral disc 
extrusion,
occupying that subarticular zone and impinging upon the 
traversing right L5
and, possibly, more caudal nerve roots at that site.
2. Otherwise, disc degeneration at several lumbar and cervical 
levels, with
only mild bulging and no other spinal canal or neural foraminal 
compromise.
3. No signal abnormality or pathologic enhancement to suggest
spondylodiscitis or paraspinal or epidural abscess.
 
 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ year old gentleman with recurrent sinus infection since 
childhood comes with acute onset of low back pain radiating to 
his lower extremities right more than left preceeded by ___ 
weeks of headache that looks like sinus headache, runny nose, 
generalized arthrlagia, vomiting, and skin lesions that were 
most likely tenia versicolor. He had an MRI of the spine which 
showed ___ disc degeneration with large right paracentral disc 
extrusion, occupying that subarticular zone and impinging upon 
the traversing right L5 and, possibly, more caudal nerve roots 
at that site. ___ addition, it also showed degenerative changes 
at the thoracic and cervical spaces. His skin lesions improved 
with daily terbinafine cream. He was discharged with pain killer 
regimen of tylenol, ibuprofen and short course of oxycodone with 
instructions to follow with a local ___ ___ spine exercise 
focusing on his underlying spine pathology. 

# Back pain: history and exam contains both components of 
radiculopathy and muscular pain. No fever or leukocytosis to be 
concerned about an abscess or infectious process. No IV drug 
use. Mild midline tenderness but more tender paraspinally. His 
pain was controlled with tylenol every 8 hour, oxycodone, 2 
shots of toradol and flexeril as an inpatient. He was evaluated 
by physical therapy and found not able to walk because of pain. 
Spine Xray did not show fractures however Spine MRI showed ___ 
disc degeneration with large right paracentral disc extrusion 
impinging upon the right L5. After better pain controll, he was 
___ by ___ during which he was slightly orthostatic. He 
was educated how to get out of bed. He is discharged with 
standing tylenol regimen, ibuprofen, short course of oxycodone. 
He is instructed to call the ___ and schedule a follow up 
appointment with a new primary car physician since he does not 
have one. He was also instructed to call a local ___ facility for 
spine exercise focusing on his underlying spine pathology. 

# Tenia versicolor: He ___ brownish ___ itchy macules on 
his chest, upper abdomen, shoulders and back. Impression was 
most likely tenia versicolor. Topical terbinafine cream was 
applied daily for a total course of 2 weeks. This can be 
followed up once he sees a new primary care physician. 

# Black sputum: Patient reported having blackish sputum over 
several months. He works at ___ and his job includes 
preparing the hooka's for the customers. He does this ___ 
times per day (preparation includes inhaling the first few puffs 
to make it ready for the customor). His sputum cytology was 
negative however showed numerous pigmented macrophages, 
consistent with the hooka preparation technique. The patient was 
instructed that inhaling the hooka is equivalent to smoking. 

Tranistional issues:
- Patient does not have a primary care physician. He is 
instructed to call ___ to schedule a follow up with a new 
primary care physician
- ___ dis degeneration with large disc herniation impinging 
right L5.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr ___,

It was a great pleasure taking care of you as your doctor. As 
you know you were admitted to ___ for your back pain shooting 
to your legs on both sides. We did XRAYS of your back bone which 
didn't reveal abnormalities. During your stay we provided you 
pain killers including tylenol and oxycodone and a dose of 
toradol. 

Given you couldn't work with ___ because of continuous pain, we 
ordered MRI of your spine which showed a ruptured disc at L4/L5 
that was compressing your nerve root.  This is a very common 
problem and fortunately does not require surgery.  Conservative 
medical management with physical therapy, standing 
___ medications and pain control is very 
effective.  You should expect to have continued back pain for 
the next several days with gradual improvement.

Your sputum analysis showed pigmented white cells which is most 
likely because of hooka preparation to the customers. Please be 
advised that the hooka inhalation is equivalent to cigarette 
smoking. 

Please START tylenol ___ mg 2 tablet three times daily for pain 
for 7 days

Please START Ibuprofen 800 mg three times a day (take it after 
meals please) for 12 days

If the above medications do not help to control the pain, please 
take oxycodone 5 mg every ___ hour as needed. Please do not 
drive or operate machinery while taking oxycodone. 

Please APPLY terbinafine cream once daily on the affected areas 
of your skin (we think this is a fungal infection called Tenia 
Versicolor). This should be for a total of 2 weeks only. 

Please call the number provided below to establish care with new 
primary care physician. 
 
Followup Instructions:
