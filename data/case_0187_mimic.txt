Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,

You were admitted to ___ for 
acute cholecystitis and underwent a laparoscopic 
cholecystectomy. Your recovery at the hospital has gone well and 
today you will be going home.

Please read over this material carefully. 

If you have strips of tape [Steri-strips] on the incisions: 
remove the bandage but leave the strips of tape directly on the 
skin for a week; no other dressing is necessary.

If you have sutures or staples, you may wish to keep a dressing 
on to protect the incision. Change the dressing and inspect your 
wound every day and as needed.

Shower or bathe, but do not sit in a bathtub or immerse the 
operative incision for at least until 72 hours after surgery. 
You may use a mild soap to gently cleanse your incision and 
carefully pat dry.

Medications:
It is normal to have pain at your incision sites. You will 
receive a prescription for pain medicine before you leave the 
hospital. You may need to take this pain medication regularly, 
as directed, for the first few days after you leave the 
hospital. This should help control your pain, allow you to be 
more active and speed up your recovery.

Acetaminophen [Tylenol] or ibuprofen [Motrin] ___ tablets every 
___ hours for mild or moderate discomfort.

Prescribed narcotic medications [oxycodone, hydromorphone] for 
severe discomfort. Do not drink alcoholic beverages while taking 
these narcotics.

Wounds:
A few spots of blood on the bandage is common. Call your surgeon 
if there are other signs of bleeding.
A moderate amount of black and blue skin discoloration around 
the wounds is common.

A firm, tender swelling will develop beneath the incision(s). 
These will disappear after several weeks.
Support the lower abdomen with a small pillow when coughing or 
sneezing.

Diet:
Try to drink several glasses of juice or water per day.

You may eat a normal diet as tolerated.

Occasionally, patients develop constipation after surgery due to 
inactivity and narcotic pain medicine. Constipation may be 
relieved by increasing fluid intake and by taking an 
over-the-counter and prescribed stool softener or mild laxative 
(milk of magnesia). Bowel function should return to its previous 
pattern within a week. Stop taking these medications if 
experiencing loose stools.

Activities at Home:
In the first week after surgery, gradually increase your 
activity, taking rest periods as needed. Get adequate sleep at 
night.
Light aerobic exercise (walking, biking, swimming, golfing, 
jogging) is encouraged within the limits of your pain tolerance.
Avoid vigorous physical activity (sprinting, sit-ups, or lifting 
more than ___ lbs) for several weeks after surgery.

Driving a car:
You may resume driving when you no longer take narcotic pain 
medication.

Sexual Activity:
Gradually return to your previous level of activity. Certain 
positions may be more comfortable until the wound heals.

Work:
___
Notify your physician if any of these occur:
•body temperature greater than 101°F
•drainage or fluid from incision
•increased wound tenderness or soreness
•significant redness or swelling at the incision site
•persistent nausea, vomiting, diarrhea or constipation
•swelling, redness, or persistent pain in the legs
•difficulty urinating

Follow-up care:
Call the Acute Care Surgery Clinic at ___ to schedule 
an appointment for ___ weeks after the date of surgery.

Each day you should continue to improve. Be sure to report any 
new pain or other issues of concern promptly to your physician. 
Assume that you will feel better each day and remember that any 
adverse symptom may be indicative that you are developing a 
serious post-operative complication.

 
Followup Instructions:
___
