floor tolerating clears, on IV fluids, and oral analgesia for 
pain control.  The patient was hemodynamically stable.

Pain was well controlled. Diet was progressively advanced as

voided without problem. During this hospitalization, the patient 
ambulated early and frequently, was adherent with respiratory 
toilet and incentive spirometry, and actively participated in 
the plan of care. The patient received subcutaneous heparin and 
venodyne boots were used during this stay.

At the time of discharge, the patient was doing well, afebrile 
with stable vital signs. The patient was tolerating a regular

medicines without a prescription.
o If you go 48 hours without a bowel movement, or have pain 
moving the bowels, call your surgeon.
