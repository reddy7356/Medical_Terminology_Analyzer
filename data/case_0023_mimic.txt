hypothyroidism, prior hx of heart block s/p pacemaker placement 
in ___, chronic hyponatremia, and prior falls who presents with 
an unwitnessed fall 1 day PTA.
.
#) Unwitnessed fall: Likely mechanical. Telemetry has shown no 
abnormalities and pacer interrogation was unremarkable. Echo 
shows increased LV wall thickness compared to ___ study, 
unchanged mild AS and mild LV diastolic dysfunction. Patient was 
found to be orthostatic yesterday and received 1L NS. ___ 
recommended acute rehabilitation. Additionally, it is possible 
that the pt. becomes confused at night leading to falls. He was 
started on zyprexa at bedtime to prevent agitation at night. 
Detrol was stopped as this medication can worsen dementia, 
however, if urinary continence becomes a problem he should 
discuss an alternate medication.
Also, he was seen by orthopedics for neck pain. He was 
radiographically cleared as well as cleared by orthopedics. He 
has a follow up appointment with orthopedics as an outpatient 
and is to wear a soft collar for comfort until that time.

consulted they recommended followup in their clinic as an 
outpatient.

#) Thoracic vertebral compression fracture: CXR prelim read 
states apparent further collapse of at least one lower thoracic 
vertebral body, worse since ___. MRI contraindicated given 
patient's pacemaker. Do not obtain CT T-spine for now. 
Acetaminophen 325-650mg PO Q6H:PRN changed to standing dose. If 
pain begins to significantly affect patient, consider surgical 
consult and kyphoplasty.
.
#) Hyponatremia: Na 127 on admission, which is approx patient's 
baseline for at least past ___ years. Now Na 130. Patient worked 
up for hyponatremia during previous hospitalization with urine 
lytes c/w SIADH. Since patient's current Na is at/above his 
baseline, monitored Na. Am cortisol drawn to evaluate as 
possible cause for hyponatremia and orthostatic hypotension and 
it was 17.8, within the normal range
.
#) HTN: Received lisinopril  10 mg daily in house. Will be 
discharged on Fosinopril 20 mg dialy, his home medication.

syncope. He has a pacemaker but no arrhythmia was detected on 
EKG or 24 hour monitoring. Head CT did not reveal a bleed or new 
ischemic stroke. It did show remarkable brain atrophy and 
encephalomalacia. His physical examination did not suggest an 
etiology for syncope ( other than aortic stenosis murmur, mild 
on Echocardiogram in ___ or focal neurological defects. He 
had unremarkable U/A, and a normal basic laboratory testing. His 
chest X ray did not suggest pneumonia. He was ruled out for ACS 
and myocardial infarction. The patient is DNR/DNI and his sons 
requested limited work up because of his advanced dementia. In 
the setting of limited history, any work up will be of low yield 
any way. He had mild hyponatremia that does not explain his 
symptoms. His anemia is normocytic and chronic in nature as 
well. He also has chronic mild elevation of his bilirubin.
I discussed the need for a full nursing home placement in the 
near future, as he has progressive difficulty in ambulation, 
recurrent falls, and increased dependency. Both sons agree with 
the plan. He may need to be considered for hospice care or no 
further hospitalizations in the near future.

History of Present Illness:
Mr. ___ is a ___ y/o man with PMH notable for HTN, dementia, 
hypothyroidism, and bradycardia s/p ___ placement who presents 
after fall at his nursing facility earlier today. About 12 noon, 
the patient was found on the floor in his room; he may not have 
been wearing any shoes. His walker, which he uses chronically, 
was located near him at the time. He does not recall specific 
events leading to this fall and cannot tell me the mechanism of 
the fall or how he landed. He denies any loss of consciousness, 
chest pain, dizziness/lightheadedness, palpitations, abdominal 
pain, nausea, vomiting, or other symptoms around the time of the 
fall. His son, who is present on my interview, is not sure if 
these assertions are correct given the patient's dementia. He 
was not confused more than his baseline nor did the staff at his 
nursing facility notice any focal neurologic deficits. He had 
not urinated or defecated prior to falling per his report. He 
did not have lunch but has had a normal appetite per his report. 
Vitals per EMS were BP 150/80, HR 76. He was sitting up next to 
a chair on their arrival.  

In the ED, initial vitals were T 97.9, HR 64, BP 165/90, RR 20, 
95% on RA. He complained of right rib pain in the ED and was 
found to have fractures of the ___ and 7th ribs on the right on 
CT scan. He received morphine 2 mg IV X 1 for pain.  

Currently, the patient denies any pain. He cannot recall exact 
events leading to fall or the fall itself. He denies any 
numbness/tingling of the extremities and denies any slurred 
speech.  

ROS: Denies fever, chills, night sweats, headache, vision 
changes, rhinorrhea, congestion, sore throat, cough, shortness 
of breath, chest pain, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting,

Pertinent Results:
Imaging:
Head CT 
No evidence of acute intracranial process.

CXR:
IMPRESSION: 
1) Stable cardiomegaly and bibasilar atelectasis. 
2) Two lower thoracic vertebral body compression fractures which 
appear 
similar to the prior study from ___. 

Chest/Abdomen/Pelvis CT (& CT Angiography)
IMPRESSION: 
1. Acute right sixth and seventh rib fractures. No pneumothorax. 

2. Small peripheral wedge-shaped opacity in the left lower lobe 
may represent a focus of atelectasis, though a pulmonary infarct 
cannot be excluded. 
3. Fat stranding around the descending and sigmoid colon may 
represent mild acute uncomplicated diverticulitis, though 
clinical correlation is needed.  
4. 4-mm left lower lobe pulmonary nodule. In the setting of 
multiple sequela of prior granulomatous exposure (including 
calcified hilar nodes and splenic granulomas), this may 
represent a non-calcified granuloma. However, if there are 
significant risks factors for malignancy (i.e., smoking), 
followup chest CT in one year can be pursued to evaluate for 
stability. 
5. Extensive atherosclerotic calcifications including the 
thoracoabdominal 
aorta and coronary arteries.
