change in his bowel movements, which were previously normal once
a day, becoming several times a day with soft stools.  He states
that over the summer, he was more fatigued than usual with
burping.  He presented to his primary care physician at which
point he had laboratory testing, and was referred for an
ultrasound of his liver followed by a CT of his abdomen.  He was
seen by gastroenterologist, Dr. ___, at ___ and was referred to ___ for ERCP.

STUDIES
CXR ___:
FINDINGS: 
Frontal and lateral chest radiograph demonstrates well expanded 
and clear lungs with no focal consolidation identified. Linear 
opacity within the left lower lung base consistent with 
atelectasis. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Re- 
demonstration of calcified granuloma projecting over the right 
midlung and better demonstrated on CT dated ___ 
(3:20). The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are within 
normal limits.   
IMPRESSION: No pneumonia. 

___  TTE
The left atrium is normal in size. The left atrial volume is 
normal. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and 
regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF >55%). Tissue 
Doppler imaging suggests a normal left ventricular filling 
pressure (PCWP<12mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size and free 
wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear 
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic 
stenosis or aortic regurgitation. No masses or vegetations are 
seen on the aortic valve. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. 
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no 
mitral valve prolapse. No mass or vegetation is seen on the 
mitral valve. No mitral regurgitation is seen. The left 
ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation. The 
estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There is 
no pericardial effusion. 
IMPRESSION: Normal biventricular cavity size and regional/global 
systolic function. No echocardiographic evidence of 
endocarditis. No pathologic vlavular regurgitation. 

___  CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST
IMPRESSION: 
1. No evidence of acute intracranial process.   
2. No evidence of intracranial metastatic disease. If there 
remains ongoing clinical concern, MRI would be more sensitive 
for the detection of occult metastatic disease. 

___  LIVER OR GALLBLADDER US (SINGLE ORGAN)
IMPRESSION: 
1. Moderate left intrahepatic biliary dilatation similar to the 
recent CT, but improved from the previous ultrasound in 
___.  
2. Metallic common bile duct stent with pneumobilia consistent 
with stent patency. 
3. Nondistended gallbladder containing gas and minor sludge. No 
evidence of cholecystitis. No hepatic abscess demonstrated. 

___  PORTABLE ABDOMEN
IMPRESSION: Unremarkable bowel gas pattern without evidence of 
obstruction or megacolon.  

___  CT ABD & PELVIS WITH CONTRAST  
1. New thickening of the sigmoid and descending colon with 
adjacent fat stranding could be secondary to colitis. Note is 
also made of thickening of the cecum. 
2. Stable position of the biliary stents with persistent 
pneumobilia and mild intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation. 
3. Stable periportal and anterior caval lymph nodes. 

___ CXR
In comparison with the earlier study of this date, the PICC line 

has been pulled back so the tip lies in the upper portion of the 
SVC.  
Otherwise, little change. 
  
___ MRI BRAIN
There is no evidence of acute intracranial process or diffusion 
abnormalities.  There is no evidence of abnormal enhancement to 
indicate 
leptomeningeal disease or metastases. 
  
Scattered foci of high signal intensity are demonstrated in the 
subcortical 
white matter on FLAIR and T2-weighted images, which are 
nonspecific and may 
reflect areas of a small vessel disease.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ is a ___ year old man with cholangiocarcinoma s/p 3 
cycles of Cis/Gem (last dose on ___ C3D8) who presents with 
fever and cough, found to have e.coli bacteremia and c.diff 
complicated by delirium.

ACUTE ISSUES:
# E. Coli bacteremia: the patient was found to have e.coli 
bacteremia and was initially started on zosyn and transitioned 
to meropenem in house based on culture sensis. He was changed 
over to ertapenem for ease of administration. He will complete a 
2 week course (via PICC) on ___. He did have fevers on 
admission which did not recur after he was started on broad 
spectrum antibiotics. The source of the bacteremia was not 
clear: UA, RUQ and CT abdomen and pelvis were negative. 
Possibly, a transient biliary obstruction lead to his 
bacteremia. He did not require ERCP during this admission.

# C.diff diarrhea: the patient did endorse diarrhea and c.diff 
was positive. Diarrhea improved with treatment with PO Vanco, 
with which he was treated due to his age and his concomitant 
bacteremia with aid from ID consultants. He should take PO vanco 
while he is being treated with ertapenem and for 2 weeks 
following completion of ertapenem, until ___.

# Delirium: the patient was delirious while he was bacteremic. 
His confusion improved with treatment, but he was still a bit 
"off" per his wife. For example, he insisted that he had $3 
million and she stated that he was previously a shy, reserved 
man, and he is currently quite talkative. For these reasons, CT 
head and MRI brain were obtained but were negative. The cause of 
his personality change is unclear but he is high functioning and 
is always oriented and alert.

CHRONIC ISSUES:
# Cholangiocarcinoma: s/p 3 cycles of Cis/Gem.  Pt reports 
increased side effects with most recently dose on ___.

# HTN: atenolol as per home dose

# BPH: terazosin as per home dose

TRANSITIONS OF CARE:
#. CODE: FULL, confirmed 
#. HCP: wife ___ ___
#. PENDING AT TIME OF DISCHARGE: blood cultures x3.
#. TRANSITIONS OF CARE: 
- Ertapenem until ___ via ___. PICC can be removed after the 
medication is completed.
- Check labs on ___
- PO Vanco until ___ for c.diff

History of Present Illness:
Mr. ___ is a ___ male well-known to our service who has a 
history of cholangiocarcinoma with recent admission for e.coli 
bacteremia and c.diff colitis now being transferred from an OSH 
for altered mental status. Per report from the OSH, the night 
prior to transfer, on ___ at 5pm, the patient's wife noticed 
that he was only answering yes and no to questions. He went to 
the ER, where they did a CT, which was by report, normal. He was 
admitted to the hospital and a neurology consult was ordered but 
not performed. An EEG was also ordered but not performed. He had 
a normal UA and normal labs, except his coags were slightly 
elevated. He had blood cultures obtained. He was noticed to have 
waxing/waning mental status, sometimes being angry and irritated 
and sometimes responding only yes/no and repeating the word 
"glitch" often. He did receive one dose of aspirin 81mg on the 
day of transfer. His vital signs prior to transfer were: BP 
129/80 RR 18 HR 93 T 97.4 O2 sat 99%. 

In speaking to the patient, he says "everything is fine." And he 
explains in detail how the protein in his brain is "glitched" 
and not firing correctly. However, he then is unable to add

IMAGING
MRI BRAIN ___
No significant changes are demonstrated since the most recent 
study, there is no evidence of acute or subacute intracranial 
process.  There 
is no evidence of abnormal enhancement to suggest metastatic 
disease.  Foci of 
high signal intensity identified in the subcortical and 
periventricular white 
matter on T2 and FLAIR sequences are likely consistent with 
changes due to 
small vessel disease. 

EEG ___
This telemetry captured no pushbutton activations. It showed a 
normal background in wakefulness and sleep. There were no focal 
abnormalities 
or epileptiform features. 

EEG ___
This telemetry captured no pushbutton activations. It showed a 
mildly slow background throughout the one that reached 8 Hz 
frequency 
posteriorly in wakefulness at times. There were no substantial 
abnormalities. 
There were no areas of prominent focal slowing. There were no 
epileptiform 
features or electrographic seizures.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ is a ___ year old man with cholangiocarcinoma s/p 3 
cycles of Cis/Gem (last dose on ___ C3D8) who presented 
with altered mental status after recent admission for e.coli 
bacteremia and c.diff.

ACUTE CARE
# Altered mental status: Concern high for stroke initially but 
exam non focal with motor and sensory intact and MRI brain 
without abnormalities. Neurology consultants did not feel that 
there was a central explanation for his change in mental status 
and EEG was also negative. MRI did not show signs of metastatic 
disease to the brain so neuro-oncology was only involved 
initially.
He was felt to be slightly disinhibited and slightly manic, thus 
psychiatry was consulted, but their opinion was that this was 
not a psychiatric disorder due to the patient's lack of psych 
history, very unlikely to have initial presentation at age ___. 
Infectious disease was also re-consulted and they did not feel 
that infection or antibiotic side effect could account for this 
presentation. Thus, no LP was done.
Ultimately, it was felt that he patient had delirium which was 
secondary to a combination of frontotemporal dementia which was 
unmasked with the stresses of chemo, bacteremia, c.diff,

(most recently with associated ESBL E coli bacteremia;  treated 
with ERCP ___ with clean out of his metal stents and 14d 
meropenem), who was readmitted with fever, which may be due to 
cholangitis. 

#CHOLANGITIS OF R INTRAHEPATIC BILE DUCTS
#FEVER
   The patient presented with fever, which may be due to 
cholangitis. CXR showed an equivocal LLL pneumonia, so a 
bacterial or viral PNA is an alternate explanation. He has been 
clinically stable and afebrile on meropenem (his ESBL E coli 
from the last admission is sensitive only to carbapenems and 
Zosyn). ID noted that he is increasingly pancytopenic, which has 
happened previously on meropenem, and switched him to ertapenem, 
which he has tolerated before. 
   MRCP on this admission showed persistent cholangitis in the 
intrahepatic bile ducts of the R lobe of the liver. ERCP was 
performed on ___ with cleanout of the metal stents, but they 
were unable to access the R intrahepatic system, suggesting the 
obstruction likely persists. Nonetheless, they feel that 
percutaneous biliary drain would not be indicated and suggest 
management with antibiotics alone. 
   Plan is for a two week total course of ertapenem. When this 
ends, he will start delafloxacin BID for suppressive therapy. He 
will also follow regularly with the ERCP team in clinic.
 
#Cholangiocarcinoma 
Followed by Dr. ___ and is s/p cisplatin/gemcitabine x 7.5 
cycles and cyberknife, now on surveillance. 
A biopsy was taken from two polyps from D2 segment of the 
duodenum during his ERCP, which is pending at time of discharge. 


#Pancytopenia
Roughly stable as compared to recent baseline, appears due to be 
chronic myelosuppression with acute worsening possibly 
attributable to meropenem. He was improving after meropenem was 
switched, but will need his counts followed. 

HCP: his wife, ___ (___)
#Code: full

OUTSTANDING ISSUES:
-Plan is for a two week total course of ertapenem via home 
infusion.
-Watch for improvement in pancytopenia off meropenem.
-Given one month supply of delafloxacin, which ID will have to 
refill if they decide to continue this. The medication is 
covered by insurance with a $30 copay. 
-A biopsy was taken from two polyps from D2 segment of the 
duodenum during his ERCP, which is pending at time of discharge.

Discharge Instructions:
You came to the hospital with a fever. We are not totally sure 
this wasn't just caused by a respiratory virus, but your liver 
MRI showed residual inflammation around the branch bile ducts 
inside the lever, so leftover cholangitis is a concern.

We are treating you with 12 more days of IV antibiotics to try 
and clear this (ERTAPENEM once daily). You will need labs 
monitored while you are on antibiotics. The visiting nurse 
helping with antibiotics should be able to draw these off your 
PICC, but if you have any issues I have given you a paper script 
for labs that you can take to ___, or any outpatient lab 
provider (i.e. your local ___ Labs). 
After you are done with the ertapenem, please take DELAFLOXACIN 
twice daily as a suppressive treatment. 

It was a pleasure caring for you! If you have any logistical 
issues with your care transition, feel free to call or text your 
discharging doctor's ___ cell ___.

==================================
            Radiology            
==================================
CXR ___
FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest.  The lungs are 
well expanded and
clear.  A granuloma is seen in the right lateral lung, unchanged 
to prior
exam.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The 
cardiomediastinal
silhouette is unremarkable.  
 
IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary process.  
 
RUQ US ___
FINDINGS:  This exam is very limited, especially with respect to 
the midline
structures due to gaseous distention of the abdomen and stents 
in the biliary
ducts.  The liver is enlarged to 24.8 cm and demonstrates no 
evidence of focal
lesions or textural abnormality.  Doppler assessment of the main 
portal vein
shows patency and hepatopetal flow.  There is no ascites.  There 
is no
evidence of intrahepatic or extrahepatic biliary dilatation.  
Biliary stents
are seen within the central bile ducts.  The gallbladder 
demonstrates the wall
thickening without hydropic changes.  The pancreas is not 
visualized on this
exam.  Limited views of the right kidney are unremarkable.  
 
IMPRESSION:  Limited exam due to gaseous distention of the 
abdomen and stents
in the biliary ducts.
 
1.  No acute findings, but if clinical concern persists for 
cholangitis, CT
could allow for further assessment.  
 
2.  Hepatomegaly.

 
Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ is a ___ year old man with cholangiocarcinoma 
currently on gem/cis (last dose ___ who presented with 
fevers and chills after fiducial placement and recent admission 
for e.coli bacteremia and c.diff; BCx now growing e. coli again

ACTIVE ISSUES
=============

#Sepsis:  Patient was admitted to the FICU for evidence of 
hemodynamic instability with significant tachycardia in the 
setting of presumed hepatobiliary sepsis.  Other sources of 
infection were considered but thought to be less likely given 
negative CXR and UA.    Pt.'s initially was rigoring in the ED.  
He received several liters of IVF and was empirically given a 
dose of zosyn prior to transfer.  Upon arrival, pt's previous 
culture data was reviewed showing evidence of MDR E.Coli.  As 
such, he was empirically started on Vancomycin and Meropenem.  
He stabilized and was transferred to the floor for further 
management. After cultures grew e. coli with a similar 
resistance pattern to previous, vancomycin was discontinued. He 
continued having daily fevers to 101 for the first 2 days and 
then defervesced. He had a PICC line placed and will receive 
antibiotics at home (ertapenem).  

#Recent CDiff Infection:  Pt. also with recent CDiff infection 
with completion of course 3 days prior to presentation.  He was 
noted to have ongoing loose stools and was restarted on PO 
vancomycin. Cdiff returned negative, but given his recent 
history and that he will be on antibiotics for a long course, we 
recommended continuing PO vancomycin until he completes his 
ertapenem. 

CHRONIC ISSUES
===============

# Cholangiocarcinoma: s/p 3.5 cycles of Cis/Gem.  Most recent 
Cycle 4 Day 8 dose held secondary to recent fiducial placement 
and thrombocytopenia.

#Chronic Cough:  Most likely ___ post-nasal drip. On chronic 
loratadine and steroid nasal spray. CXR clear.  

# HTN:  Home atenolol initially held given septic picture, 
restarted during hospital stay

# BPH:  Home terazosin initially held given septic picture, 
restarted during hospital stay

greater than 30 minutes was spent in discharge planning on the 
day of discharge

___ RUQ U/S:
IMPRESSION:   
1. Mildly coarsened hepatic parenchyma with an atrophic left 
lobe which is not well seen. 
2. Stable splenomegaly. 

___ MRCP:
IMPRESSION:  
1. Multifocal cholangitis predominately involving segments V and 
VI.  No 
hepatic abscess. 
2. Mild progression of left intrahepatic biliary duct dilation 
with persistent atrophy of the left hepatic lobe.  Persistent 
areas of abnormal enhancement at the biliary confluence likely 
related to posttreatment inflammatory fibrosis however viable 
tumor cannot be excluded.  No new soft tissue lesion identified.

progression of upstream left biliary duct dilation. 
4. Unchanged severe attenuation of the right and left portal 
veins.

___ ERCP:
The scout film showed 2 metak stents and surgical clips in the 
RUQ.
Two metal stents were emerging from the major papilla.
The CBD metal stent was cannulated using a biliary balloon 
preloaded with 0.025in guidewire.
There was brisk flow of contrast in the intrahepatic bile ducts.
The CBD stent was swept one time using a balloon. After balloon 
sweeps active bleeding from the CBD was noted.
Sicne the source of bleeding was from the upper CBD. The 
decision was made to terminate the procedure after suction of 
blood from the duodenum and stomach. ___ was contacted for urgent 
angiography for control of bleeding and posisble PTBD.

Brief Hospital Course:
___ year old gentleman with history of NIDDM2, HTN, BPH, GERD, 
cholangiocarcinoma s/p gemcitabine/cisplatin and radiation ___ 
and complicated by recurrent biliary obstruction/cholangitis 
with MDR E coli and s/p multiple ERCPs (2 metal stent still in 
place from ___ and most recently PTBD that fell out ___ 
without replacement who was admitted from home on ___ for 
fevers and transferred to ___ after ERCP c/b hemobilia.

# Hemobilia: Patient developed upper CBD bleeding during ERCP 
with balloon sweep and clearance of debris from L CBD stent; 
procedure aborted and R CBD stent not interrogated. He was taken 
to recovery suite and ___ was contacted. He was transferred to 
the FICU at this time with plans for a CTA to be obtained. 
Post-procedurally, patient's hemoglobin remained stable and he 
was normotensive without tachycardia. His home atenolol was 
held. Bleeding stabilized without intervention and he did not 
require CTA.

# Fevers
# Cholangitis: Presented with fever, nausea, vomiting and MRCP 
findings of multifocal cholangitis with partial CBD stent 
obstruction. The patient was started on meopenem given his 
history of MDR E.coli. He was taken to ERCP but the procedure 
aborted before source control could be obtained due to hemobilia 
(see above). Transaminases downtrended and tbili remained 
stable. Blood cultures remained negative.  He remained afebrile 
and completed a 7-day course of meropenem without complication, 
relapse/recurrence of fever.

# Pancytopenia - anemia at baseline, stable. He has chronic 
thrombocytopenia which remained stable. He may also have an 
element of anemia of chronic disease.
Anaplasma PCR negative. Leukopenia was thought to be most likely 
reactive due to acute illness

CHRONIC ISSUES:

# Migraines: continued home atenolol, home pseudoephdedrine, 
loratadine, fluticasone spray

# BPH: continued home tamsulosin/finasteride

# NIDDM2: diet/exercise controlled. Placed on ISS while 
hospitalized

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,

You came in with fevers. We concluded that you had an infection 
in your bile ducts (cholangitis). We treated you with IV 
antibiotics and the infection improved. During your ERCP 
procedure you were found to have bleeding (hemobilia). The 
bleeding fortunately stopped on its own and you did not require 
any further procedures.

IMPRESSION:  
  
1.  Mild intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation within atrophic 
left lobe with multifocal areas of stenosis.  Right and left 
hepatic ducts stents are in place.  Air within the left ducts 
indicates patency of the biliary stent.  Mild periductal 
enhancement is suggestive of cholangitis.  Peripheral foci of 
enhancement in the right lobe may be perfusional or related to 
cholangitis. 
2.  Known central cholangiocarcinoma is not well visualized. 
3.  Splenomegaly similar to prior. 
4.  Mild pancreatic ductal dilatation to 5 mm similar to prior 
with pancreatic atrophy. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ y/o male with stage IV cholangiocarcinoma with PTBD and 
metallic extrahepatic biliary stents admitted with rigors, 
elevated bilirubin consistent with cholangitis.

# Cholangitis with signs of early sepsis (rigors, fevers, HR 
greater than 90, clear source):  
The patient had undergone PTBD ballon sweep and stent exchange 
on the day of admission. He was started on unasyn, and blood 
cultures and an MRCP were ordered. Blood cultures quickly grew 
gram-negative rods, so the patient was switched to meropenem 
given his prior history of resistant GNRs. ERCP and ___ were 
consulted and the patient underwent ERCP on ___ with removal 
of stones, sludge and debris. His PTBD drain was capped. LFTs 
were slightly elevated but the patient was tolerating a regular 
diet without abdominal pain or fever prior to discharge. The 
patient was seen by the ID service who recommended treating with 
IV meropenem (E. Coli was intermediate to ertapenem) to complete 
a 10 day course. The patient will follow up with ___ for 
regularly scheduled stent exchange. he will follow up with his 
oncologist Dr. ___ in ___ as scheduled. He should have 
follow up LFTs checked at PCP follow up. 

# History of C diff x 3:  Started on prophylactic vancomycin for 
the course of antibiotics. Vancomycin should end the day IV 
meropenem ends.
# Migraines: Held atenolol prophylaxis given active infection, 
concern for developing hypotension. This was resumed on 
discharge.
# BPH:  Continued finasteride and tamsulosin.
# Diabetes Mellitus:  Newly diagnosed, managing with diet and 
exercise, continued diabetic diet and sliding scale insulin.

IMAGING:
=========
___ CT Abd / Pelvis
IMPRESSION: 
1.  Stable intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation with 
pneumobilia.  Two 
common bile duct stents remain in place. Given the large degree 
of 
pneumobilia, this suggests that the stent draing the left 
biliary system is partially obstructed.
2.  Resolved findings of colitis.
.
___ PA/Lat CXR
IMPRESSION:  Basilar atelectasis without convincing signs of 
pneumonia. Interval removal of PICC line.
 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ with a hx of GERD, rosacea, BPH and stage ___ unresectable 
extrahepatic choangiocarcinoma on gemcitabine/cisplatin (___), recently treated for C. diff, hx of GNR bacteremia 
presenting with predominantly dry cough x2 weeks, fatigue x2 
days, and low grade fever x1 day. 
.
# Fever: Reported temp at home as high as 101, 100.8 at ED 
triage. No localizing symptoms except for cough which maybe 
chronic and congestion x2 weeks. Given history of GNR bacteremia 
due to cholangitis concern for there was concern for recurrent 
cholangitis. Additionally, bilirubin was elevated to 1.7 on 
admission which is higher than baseline. Antibioitics were held 
and the patent had a CT abdomen which raised concern for 
partially occluded stents. His case was discussed with the ERCP 
team, and given that he defevervesced, LFTs normalized and he 
was without abdominal pain, ERCP was not completed. The patient 
also had negative urine, blood cultures (x72 hours, final 
pending) and was ruled out for influenza. C. diff was not sent 
as he was having normal, formed stools.  His CT scan did not 
show any evidence of colitis.  Suspect that his symptoms may 
have been due to viral illness.  He does have mild leukopenia 
and mild thrombocytopenia, which could be due to viral illness, 
or alternatively to his chemotherapy.  
.
# Cholangiocarcinoma: s/p 5 cycles of Cis/Gem.  Patient will 
follow with his oncologist as an outpatient.

Discharge Instructions:
It was a pleasure taking care of you during your recent 
admission to ___. You were admitted with fevers. Your liver 
tests were elevated and you had a CT scan to make sure the 
stents in your bile ducts were still in place. The CT showed 
that the stents may be blocked, causing your fever, but you had 
no further fevers and your liver tests normalized.  Your case 
was discussed and reviewed with the Advanced Endoscopy Team.  We 
suspect your symptoms may have been due to acute viral illness.  
Your blood counts (the white blood cells and the platelet count) 
are a little low, and we recommend that you have them re-checked 
when you follow-up with your oncologists.  You should follow up 
with your oncologist as scheduled.

currently hemodynamically stable and without findings concerning 
for sepsis on the floor. He was initially treated for concern 
for biliary infection with meropenem given past culture 
sensitivities, and received PO vancomycin for C. diff 
prophylaxis given history of C. diff infection. He underwent ___

node. 
3.  No acute intraabdominal process.  

___ ERCP***********
Findings: 
Esophagus: Limited exam of the esophagus was normal 
Stomach: Limited exam of the stomach was normal 
Duodenum: Limited exam of the duodenum was normal 
Major Papilla: 2 metal stents previously placed in the biliary 
duct were found in the major papilla. The stents were in place 
without any migration.  
Cannulation:  Selective cannulation of both left and right metal 
stents was successful and deep using a free-hand technique. 
Contrast medium was injected resulting in partial opacification 
(complete opacification not attempted due to ongoing 
cholangitis)  
 
Fluoroscopic Interpretation of Biliary Tree:
The left sided metal stent was patient without any filling 
defects. Multiple balloon sweeps were performed resulting in 
extraction of very small amount of sludge. The occlusion 
cholangiogram of the right sided metal stent revealed multiple 
filling defects consistent with stones and sludge. Multiple 
balloon sweeps were performed resulting in extraction of large 
amount of sludge, stones and debris.

sludge. 
Multiple balloon sweeps were performed resulting in extraction 
of large amount of sludge, stones and debris.   
Otherwise normal ercp to third part of the duodenum
 
Recommendations: 
Return to floor for ongoing care 
Clears when awake. Advance as tolerated. 
Continue antibiotics for cholangitis. 
Follow for response and complications. If any abdominal pain, 
fever, jaundice, gastrointestinal bleeding please call ERCP 
fellow on call (___) 
 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ with history of cholangiocarcinoma C2D11 
gemcitabine/cisplatin (last dose ___ who presented with 
fevers, transaminitis and hyponatremia after his most recent 
gemcitabine/cisplatin on ___ most likely due to biliary 
obstruction and cholangitis.

# BILIARY OBSTRUCTION/CHOLANGITIS: Elevated total bilirubin of 
4.4 on admission (elevated from 0.4 previously) and CT abdomen 
showing hepatobiliary duct dilation was concerning for biliary 
obstruction and cholangitis as a cause of the patient's fevers. 
He defervesced on  ciprofloxacin 400mg IV Q12H and metronidazole 
500 mg IV Q8H (day ___. He underwent ERCP ___ with 
successful recannulization of his right hepatobiliary stent. 
After ERCP, he remained afebrile, had no signs of post-ERCP 
pancreatitis, total bilirubin resolved to 0.9 and transaminitis 
trended down. He was switched from IV to PO antibiotics 
(ciprofloxacin 500mg PO Q12H and metronidazole 500mg PO Q8H) for 
cholangitis, for a 14 day course to end ___. During his entire 
inpatient course, he did not have significant abdominal pain and 
did not have nausea/vomiting beyond his baseline (which he says 
is related to chemo). He was discharged with antibiotics and 
close follow up with Oncology.

# CHOLANGIOCARCINOMA: Presented to us on C2D11 
gemcitabine/cisplatin, last dose on ___. Further management 
will be per outpatient oncologist.

# HYPONATREAMIA: Likely due to hypovolemia given his ongoing 
fevers and infection and resolved with IV hydration.

# PANCYTOPENIA: On admission the patient had Hct of 34 and plts 
112. On discharge his WBC had trended down to 2.0 (with 
ANC>1000), which we thought was likely related to chemo as he is 
C2D13 of gemcitabine/cisplatin. 

# Headache and BPH: Continued on home terazosin and atenolol.
  
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
# CHOLANGITIS: Discharged on PO antibiotics (ciprofloxacin 500mg 
PO Q12H and metronidazole 500mg PO Q8H) for cholangitis, for a

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,

You were admitted to the hospital because you had fevers, due to 
an obstruction of your biliary ducts in your liver. This 
obstruction caused an infection in that area. You underwent a 
procedure called ERCP, which showed that one of your two stents 
(the right one) was clogged. The stent was cleaned out, and 
there were no complications to the procedure. You were also 
started on two antibiotics to treat the infection. You should 
continue these after discharge and your last dose will be on 
___. 

Please continue to follow up with your Oncologist.
It was a pleasure taking care of you during your hospital stay.

History of Present Illness:
Mr. ___ is a ___ y/o gentleman with a pmhx. significant
for cholangiocarcinoma, stage ___, s/p 7.5 cycles of cis/gem,
finished in ___, with 2 stents in hepatic duct
(internal/external drain), percutaneous cholecystectomy tube,
sphincterotomy, with multiple episodes of biliary sepsis, who
presents with abdominal pain and elevated lipase.

Patient states that he was in his normal state of health until
day prior to admission when he developed sudden, excruciating
abdominal pain, ___, after dinner and vomited 10 times.  He 
was
having normal bowel movements and passing gas.  Mr. ___ then
presented to the ED for further evaluation.

In the ED, initial vitals were: 99.9 84 171/85 16 99%.  Labs 
were
significant for: ALT: 124 AP: 351 Tbili: 2.4 Alb: 4.4, AST: 182,
LDH: 261, Lip: 2445.  CT scan revealed: "Stable position and

right and left hepatic ducts with similar appearance of moderate
left and minimal right intrahepatic bile duct dilatation.
However, there is no significant pneumobilia, which is a change
since ___, suggesting stent occlusion. Stable
position of left internal-external biliary drain.  Limited
evaluation of known Klatskin tumor on single phase CT, but no
appreciable change.  Stable cholecystostomy tube coiled within a
collapsed gallbladder.  Splenomegaly."  ___ was consulted who
attempted "clean out" of biliary stent, placement of plastic
stent within internal portion and then exchange of external
stent.  According to ___ service, bile should now be "free
flowing."  GI/pancreatitis team was consulted as well who could
not definitively explain elevated lipase in setting of prior
sphincterotomy.  They have a low threshold for taking patient to
ERCP tomorrow. 

Mr. ___ was started on empiric ___ in the ED given
history of previous MDR biliary infection (see below).  He 
states
he had a stool guaiac that was initially negative (per his
report), but then subsequently had a bowel movement with BRBPR.

change in his bowel movements, which were previously normal once
a day, becoming several times a day with soft stools.  He states
that over the summer, he was more fatigued than usual with
burping.  He presented to his primary care physician at which
point he had laboratory testing, and was referred for an
ultrasound of his liver followed by a CT of his abdomen.  He was

PERTINENT STUDIES:
# BILIARY CATHETER REPLACEMENT ___:
IMPRESSION:   
1. Successful exchange of an occluded right internal external 
biliary drain and clearing of an occluded left biliary stent. 
2. No frank biliary bleeding throughout the procedure. Given the 
history of pre-procedure bleeding in the internal external drain 
and bright red blood per rectum, the patient had been consented 
for possible angiography. At the conclusioin of the procedure, 
the decision was made to admit the patient for serial hematocrit 
monitoring and observation. 

# ERCP REPORT ___:
Impression: The scout film revealed previous bilateral metal 
stents as well as an internal-external biliary drain in place. 
The bile duct was deeply cannulated with the balloon. 
Contrast was injected in the right metal stent and there was 
flow through the ducts extended to the right hepatic biliary 
tree. 
There were filling defects within the metal stent suggestive of 
sludge. 
The biliary tree was swept with a balloon at the proximal end of 
the metal stent in the right biliary system. 
Sludge and blood was removed. 
Overall, successful ERCP with evidence of hemobilia.
 
Recommendations: Return to ward under ongoing care. 
Patient to be seen by interventional radiology for further 
management of hemobilia. Follow for response and complications. 
If any abdominal pain, fever, jaundice, gastrointestinal 
bleeding please call ERCP fellow on call ___ 
Follow-up with Dr. ___ as previously scheduled.
 
# PORTAL VENOGRAM ___ IMPRESSION: 
  
1. Right liver arterial supply via hepatic capsular collateral 
branches. No active extravasation is visualized. However, an 
ectatic branch from the gastroepiploic artery circles around the 
indwelling biliary drain. This artery was targeted for 
embolization but could not be selectively catheterized. 
2. Normal transhepatic portal venogram. 

# HEPATIC ARTERIOGRAM ___ IMPRESSION:
FINDINGS:  
1.  Common hepatic arteriogram demonstrating patent severely 
attenuated proper hepatic artery and GDA. 
2. GDA  and gastroepiploic arteriogram demonstrating capsular 
hepatic arterial branch arising from the gastroepiploic artery 
and supplying an abnormal tangle of vessels around the biliary 
drain. 
3. Post embolization common hepatic arteriogram demonstrating 
preserved 
antegrade flow in the proper hepatic artery and the GDA. No 
further filling of the embolized artery. 
4. Superior mesenteric arteriogram demonstrating no contributing 
artery to the abnormal tangle of vessels around the biliary 
drain. The right colonic branch was see on yesterday's 
arteriogram was no longer seen. 
5. Right common femoral arteriogram demonstrating suitable 
anatomy for 
Angio-Seal deployment. 
  
IMPRESSION:  
  
Successful embolization of a capsular hepatic arterial branch 
arising from the gastroepiploic artery and a supplying the 
abnormal vessels around the biliary drain that likely 
contributed to hemobilia. 

PERTINENT IMAGING:

CT CHEST w/o CONTRAST:
FINDINGS:  
  
The examination is compared to ___. 
No incidental thyroid findings. No supraclavicular, 
infraclavicular or 
axillary lymphadenopathy. Borderline sized and partly calcified 
mediastinal lymph nodes (3, 20).  No abnormalities at the level 
of the large thoracic vessels. No pericardial effusion. The 
posterior mediastinum is unremarkable. Unchanged upper abdominal 
drain. Moderate degenerative vertebral disease. No osteolytic 
lesions at the level of the ribs, the sternum or the vertebral 
bodies. Mild bilateral apical thickening.  The assessment of the 
lung parenchyma is limited by respiratory motion artifact 's.  
Unchanged large calcified 
subpleural right upper lobe granuloma (5, 96).  Non 
characteristic scarring in the right upper lobe. New moderate 
Bilateral pleural effusions.  Subsequent areas of atelectasis at 
both the left and the right lung bases.  Minimal lower lobe 
predominant mucous plugging. Otherwise the airways are patent.no 
evidence of pneumonia or other diffuse lung disease. No 
pulmonary nodules suspicious for metastatic or malignant 
changes. 
  
IMPRESSION:  
  
New bilateral pleural effusions, moderate in extent. Subsequent 
areas of 
atelectasis at both the left and the right lung bases.  No 
pneumonia, no 
malignant or metastatic lung disease.  No adenopathy. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ is a ___ y/o gentleman with a pmhx. significant for 
cholangiocarcinoma, stage ___, s/p 7.5 cycles of cis/gem, 
finished in ___, with 2 stents in hepatic 
duct(internal/external drain), percutaneous cholecystectomy 
tube, sphincterotomy, with multiple episodes of biliary sepsis, 
who presents with abdominal pain and elevated lipase.

# Hemobilia: patient presented with gross blood visualized in 
the PTBD drain at home during his episodes of vomiting and 
abdominal pain. Patient was found to have transaminitis on 
admission secondary to the obstruction. On arrival to the ED, 
interventional radiology was consulted and a larger diameter, 
___ PTBD tube was exchanged for his hepatic drain, ___ also 
cleaned the prior stents which allowed for drainage of bile from 
the PTBD. His LFTs began trending down after decompression. 
Patient tolerated the procedure well and had marked improvement 
of his abdominal pain after the procedure. After admission to 
the ward for observation, patient began having BRBPR which 
prompted a GI consult. GI recommended an ERCP to evaluate for 
hemobilia which was positive for bleeding coming from the right 
hepatic duct stent. Patient was transferred to the SICU with the 
Transplant Surgery service following as well as interventional 
radiology. He was taken for a portal venogram which showed an 
ectatic branch from the gastroepiploic artery circles around the 
indwelling biliary drain. This artery was targeted for 
embolization but could not be selectively catheterized. Patient 
subsequently underwent hepatic arteriogram which showed 
successful embolization of a capsular hepatic arterial branch 
arising from the gastroepiploic artery and a supplying the 
abnormal vessels around the biliary drain that likely 
contributed to hemobilia. Patient was transferred back onto the 
oncology service and had resolution of his BRBPR and 
hematochezia.

# Biliary drain obstruction: pt presented with tranaminitis, 
nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain. ___ was consulted in the ED and 
performed decompression and cleaning of his hepatic drain. 
Patient had adequate output from his drain post procedure. His 
abdominal pain quickly resolved and his LFTs steadily trended 
down back to baseline. His drain was eventually capped prior to 
discharge. Patient was discharged with follow up with 
interventional radiology on ___ for maintenance of his 
biliary and cholecystostomy drains.

# Fever: Patient had remained afebrile on admission up until ___ 
when he had a low grade fever of 100.6 F while in the SICU. He 
was initially placed on empiric vancomycin and meropenem while 
in the ED on ___ due to concern for cholangitis and his history 
of MDR E. coli and VRE. His biliary culture grew mixed flora but 
his blood cultures had remained negative throughout admission. 
He was transitioned from vancomycin to linezolid while in the 
SICU to treat his fever. Infectious disease was consulted after 
transfer back to the floor on ___ who recommended switching back 
to vancomycin and meropenem and to start PO vancomycin 
prophylaxis for C. diff. Patient was treated on the vancomycin 
from ___ to ___ and meropenem from ___ to ___. He remained 
afebrile after returning to the floor. ID recommended DCing his 
IV antibiotics at time of discharge due to negative blood 
cultures but continuing the PO vancomycin for C. diff 
prophylaxis until ___. Of note, patient's C. diff assay was 
negative during this admission.

# Thrombocytopenia: Patient with drop in platelets from 130s on 
admission to ___ for the past few days. Likely 
multifactorial: dilutional vs. BM suppression from chronic 
illness vs. antibiotic effect. The SICU was concerned about HIT, 
however HITT score is 2 with low probabilty of the disease. He 
was monitored closely and his thrombocytopenia had resolved 
without medical intervention. Final etiology of his transient 
thrombocytopenia was attributed to a combination of receiving 
antibiotics in addition to his chronic illness.

# Cholangiocarcinoma: pt with stage IV cholangiocarcinoma s/p 
7.5 cycles of gem/cis without radiographic evidence of recurrent 
disease prior to admission. He will follow up with his primary 
oncologist Dr. ___ Dr. ___ on further management of 
his cholangiocarcinoma.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear. Mr. ___, 

You were seen at the ___ due to 
sudden onset abdominal pain and vomiting due to obstruction of 
your hepatic stents and biliary drain. We had the interventional 
radiologists clean out and exchange the tube to your 
percutaneous biliary drain  which relieved the obstruction. We 
also placed you on antibiotics to treat any possible infection 
caused by the initial obstruction.

During your stay, you also had blood in your stool. The 
gastroenterologists recommended doing a study called ERCP to 
visualize your biliary system. The ERCP procedure showed that 
you were bleeding from your right hepatic stent. You were 
transferred to the ICU for close monitoring. The interventional 
radiologists did a procedure to stop the bleeding.

At this time, the bleeding has been controlled and your blood 
cultures have not shown evidence of active infection. We are 
stopping your IV antibiotics, but the infectious disease 
specialists recommended you to continue taking the vancomycin by 
mouth to prevent against C. diff infection, until ___.

At this time you are ready to be discharged, we wish you the 
best in your continued recovery!

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,

It was a pleasure caring for you at ___ 
___.  You were admitted to the hospital because of 
fevers.  We were concerned that you may have had a blockage of 
your stents.  However, your CT imaging showed no blockage or 
evidence of infection around your liver/gallbladder and your 
stents appeared completely open.  Your labs were also reassuring 
that you do not have an infection of your bile ducts.  It was 
found that you have E. coli bacteria growing in your blood 
stream. A PICC line was placed for the IV antibiotic course.

Please follow-up with your outpatient providers as instructed 
below.

Thank you for allowing us to participate in your care.  All best 
wishes for your recovery.

BRIEF HOSPITAL COURSE:
======================
___ male with history of DMII, BPH, recurrent C. diff, 
and inoperable cholangiocarcinoma s/p gemcitabine/cisplatin and 
Cyberknife in ___ complicated by recurrent biliary 
obstruction/cholangitis with MDR E. coli, liver abscesses s/p 4 
week course of tigecycline/ertapenem in ___ for acute on 
chronic cholangitis, biliary sepsis and multiple ERCPs/PTBDs who 
presents with fever of 101 at home after routine PTBD exchange. 
Patient was treated with meropenem after having received one 
dose of tigecycline and ertapenem in the ED. During his 
hospitalization his blood cultures remained negative and his 
fever never recurred. His fever was felt to be due to transient 
bacteremia in the setting of recent ___ PTBD exchange on ___.

ACTIVE ISSUES:
==============
#Hx Recurrent biliary obstruction and cholangitis:
#Fevers
#Bacturia: 
Patient presented with fever of 101.3 measured the same day as 
his routine ___ guided PTBD exchange on ___. Prior to his 
procedure he had been on suppressive Bactrim per ID for 
recurrent cholangitis with MDR E. coli in the setting of his 
cholangiocarcinoma. Prior to his procedure he also received one 
dose of meropenem. On presentation to the ED the patient was 
afebrile and HDS with a normal WBC count, relatively normal LFTs 
and a lactate that down trended to 1.5 prior to transfer to the 
floor. His UA was revealing for some WBCs, RBCs and few 
bacteria; however, patient was otherwise asymptomatic and 
recently had a TURP done on ___ at OSH, and so it was felt that 
this did not represent a true UTI. In the ED patient received 
one dose tigecycline and ertapenem after blood and urine 
cultures were drawn. On the floor the patient was continued on 
IV meropenem. His fever was felt to be related to transient 
bacteremia in the setting of his recent ___ procedure given rapid 
defervesence. Blood cultures did not grow any bacteria prior to 
discharge. He was transitioned to his home Bactrim and 
discharged home. 

#Cholangiocarcinoma: 
Patient has stage IV inoperable cholangiocarcinoma. He follows 
with Dr. ___ received treatment for his cancer 
including gemcitabine + cisplatin as well as XRT in ___. During 
admission we continued his home ursodiiol and dronabinol. His 
nausea was treated with Zofran and Compazine PRN. His pain was 
minimally and largely focused around the site of recent PTBD 
manipulation; this was treated with oxycodone 2.5 mg TID PRN. 

#CONSITPATION
#REPORT OF TARRY STOOLS: 
Patient reported a recent history of straining, bloating and 
mild abdominal pain associated with constipation. On admission 
he did describe his most recent bowel movement as "tarry". 
However, there was a low suspicion for acute UGIB given his 
constipated state as blood is a cathartic and an otherwise 
stable H/H. His home PPI was continued His constipation was 
treated with senna and miralax standing.

STABLE/CHRONIC ISSUES
=============================
#Portal Vein Thrombus
Patient was previously on apixaban, which was stopped in ___. 
Should continue to discuss risk/benefit for apixaban.

# BPH
# Hematuria: 
Underwent TURP at an outside hospital on ___. Patient also 
admitted to some hematuria present at the initiation of 
urination that has been ongoing since the time of this 
procedure. His UA on admission was revealing for elevated WBCs, 
RBCs, and few bacteria; however, he was otherwise asymptomatic 
and these findings were felt to be more consistent with his 
recent GU surgery. His home finasteride was continued.

# Allergic Rhinitis
Continued his home loratadine and fluticasone

w/ complications of recurrent biliary obstruction/cholangitis 
with MDR E-coli, biliary sepsis and s/p multiple ERCPs (2 metal 
stents in place since ___ and most recently PTBD that fell 
out ___, recent admission for cholangitis c/b hemobilia 
during attempted ERCP who presents for fever to 102 a/w nausea, 
non-bloody emesis and chills on day of admission w/out abdominal 
pain consistent with prior episodes of acute cholangitis. 

# Fever:
# Cholangitis:
Mr. ___ presented with fevers and rigors, similar to multiple 
prior episodes of acute cholangitis despite 
non-obstructive-appearing LFTs. Given his prior resistance 
patterns (including MDR E.coli), he was started empirically on 
meropenem and vancomycin (although he does have a remote hx of 
VRE). He clinically improved with antibiotic therapy alone, and 
Vanco was d/c'd ___ (given prior VRE and unlikely MRSA as 
etiology). BCx were negative. RUQ U/S showed pneumobilia, making 
appreciation of the biliary anatomy difficult. Therefore, MRCP 
was performed, showing persistent but improved cholangitis with 
only stable intrahepatic biliary duct dilation. The ERCP team 
declining a repeat ERCP given significant hemobilia during his 
last admission in ___. In the absence of an obvious 
target for decompression, ___ was not consulted for consideration 
of biliary drain replacement. After discussion with the 
infectious disease team, the decision was made to treat for 
acute cholangitis with a 10d course of meropenem 500mg q6h 
(___), followed by initiation of suppressive doxycycline 
100mg DAILY (for VRE) and bactrim DS 1 tab daily. A PICC was 
placed for completion of his antibiotic course at home. He will 
f/u with his outpatient oncologist (Dr. ___ and with 
infectious disease for assistance managing his suppressive 
antibiotic regimen. 

# Pancytopenia:
Anemia and thrombocytopenia have fluctuated but appear within 
his recent baseline, with leukopenia likely secondary to acute 
illness. No evidence of bleeding, DIC, or TTP. No obvious 
medication culprits (meropenem is only new medication, <1% 
incidence of leukopenia reported). see above for last labs, WBC 
was 2.7, hb 9.7, platelet 78
Recommend cbc,bmp,lft in one week

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,

You were admitted to the hospital with fevers, likely due to 
recurrent cholangitis. MRCP confirmed inflammation of the 
biliary tree but did not reveal obvious extra-hepatic 
obstruction. You were started on antibiotics with guidance from 
the infectious disease team and improved rapidly. You are being 
discharged to complete a course of IV antibiotics, after which 
you should initiate doxycycline 100mg daily and bactrim DS 1 tab 
twice a day for suppression of future infections. Please follow 
up with your oncologist and with an infectious disease doctor 
___ have been made) after discharge.

Attending: ___.
 
Chief Complaint:
fever
 
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
___: ___ placement of percutaneous cholecystostomy tube
___: placement of midline
 
History of Present Illness:
___ y/o M with history of C.diff x3, cholangiocarcinoma c/b
biliary obstruction and recurrent cholangitis with bacteremia
requiring multiple stent placements and prolonged IV 
antibiotics,
presents with fever to ___ in ___
and is transferred here for further management. 

Regarding his complicated medical history: he has
cholangiocarcinoma metastatic to lung and last chemo was gem/cis
___ was C8D1. He has had recurrent admissions for biliary sepsis
and cholangitis with most recent admits as detailed here: Pt
admitted to BI ___: ERCP done ___ showed obstruction 
of
both metal biliary stents. He had stents ballooned and opened.
Plastic stents threaded through. He was then readmitted in early
___ with E.coli bacteremia with presumed biliary source and he
was sent home on meropenem and PO vanc (recent c.diff on 6.9)

He was re-admitted ___ with contained gall bladder rupture
and underwent percutaneous cholecystostomy tube placement (PCT)
on ___ with gall bladder cultures growing E.coli. Due to
resistance pattern he was treated with tigecycline to complete a
7 day course which finished on ___.  He was also given
concurrent PO vancomycin given history of severe C.diff, last
dose ___. 

Pt was most recently admitted ___ - ___ for abdominal pain 
and
fevers. He was treated for cholangitis given fever and abdominal
pain and antibiotics were ultimately narrowed with discharge on
cefepime/tigecycline to finish 14 day course from last negative
blood culture (culture from ___ last positive and E.coli and
klebsiella, and biliary culture grew pseudomonas). He underwent
ERCP which cleared his biliary stents. Stool from ___ came back
positive for C.diff and he was given oral vanc to finish a ___fter antibiotics were completed.

For his current admission, he developed chills and low grade 
temp
at home roughly 9 hours prior to presentation to OSH ED and on
arrival to ED was afebrile however temp did peak at 101.8. He
reported mild RUQ pain though u/s of abdomen reportedly normal,
no free fluid (though report notes that it was a limited exam
with patency of CBD stent not adequately assessed). Pt reported
possibly a bit less drainage today and this evening. Tube site
appeared fine and nontender. Labs there showed ALT 59, AST 56, 
AP
175, TB 0.5. WBC 6.3, Hct 35.7, Plts 93, with 76% pmns and 1
band. Lactate 1.3 UA neg. CXR read as LLL infiltrate but he has
had atelectasis on prior CXR at ___ in that area. He recieved
zosyn and levoquin. His HR peaked at 110-118 when he spiked a
temp but had improved to low 100s. BP was 130-150s/70s. While he
felt somewhat improved, the hospitalist at that hospital simply
refused to accept or care for the patient so the patient was
transferred from their ED directly to ___.

On arrival to the floor he tells me that he developed a fever 2
days ago (doesn't recall numbers but >101). He also feels
pressure over the right upper quadrant and has noticed decreased
biliary drainage. At home he had usually been getting 60-70ccs
out per day but over the last two days he has only about 30 cc 
in
the bag. He also has drainage externally which is saturating the
dressing over the tube insertion site. He is concerned he pulled
out the tube because it caught on something a few days ago but 
he
isn't sure. He states his general state is very similar to what
he experienced with prior episodes of cholangitis/biliary
blockage. He denies nausea or vomiting, denies constipation. He
is not sure when he stopped the tigecycline/cefepime but states
it was a few days ago (my assumption is he likely discontinued
this on ___ given last culture positive was from ___ and DC
instructions were to continue for 14 days). No diarrhea. He is
still taking the PO vanc.

Past Medical History:
PAST ONCOLOGIC HISTORY:
- ___: weight loss of about 20 lbs over 3 weeks. One day of
gastric distention, nausea and this resolved.  
- ___: started to develop intermittent nausea as well as a
change in his bowel movements, which were previously normal once
a day, becoming several times a day with soft stools.  He states
that over the summer, he was more fatigued than usual with
burping.  He presented to his primary care physician at which
point he had laboratory testing, and was referred for an
ultrasound of his liver followed by a CT of his abdomen.  He was
seen by gastroenterologist, Dr. ___, at ___ and was referred to ___ for ERCP.  
- ___: Admitted for ERCP. During that period, his
initial bilirubin was 1.6, his alkaline phosphatase 395, his AST
was 181, ALT 251 and his CA ___ was 172.  His CEA was within
normal limits.  During this admission, he had any ERCP, which
showed ductal dilation bilaterally, left more than right and a
plastic stent was placed in the left hepatic duct.  He was
discharged on ___ and during his admission, his maximum
bilirubin was 6.4. 
- ___: repeat ERCP which continue to show bilateral right
and left hepatic lobe ductal dilation with marked migration of
the stent into the small intestine.  He had bilateral plastic
stents placed at that time point.  During his initial workup, he
has also undergone a CT of his chest, which showed one small 
lung nodule of 3 mm in size and a MRCP of the abdomen, which 
indicated this ductal dilation and a mass at the bifurcation of 
the right anterior and left intrahepatic ducts worrisome for 
type IV ___ cholangiocarcinoma.  Cytology was
suspicious for carcinoma.

Brief Hospital Course:
BRIEF SUMMARY
=============
___ y/o M with history of C.diff x3, cholangiocarcinoma c/b 
biliary obstruction and recurrent cholangitis with bacteremia 
requiring multiple stent placements and prolonged IV 
antibiotics, presents with fever to ___ 
___ in ___ and is transferred here for further management.

ACTIVE ISSUES
=============
# Cholecystitis - The patient has a complex infectious history, 
most recently with multidrug-resistant E.Coli and Pseudomonas 
from biliary specimen and pan-sensitive Klebsiella bacteremia. 
He presented to OSH with fevers and received Zosyn prior to 
transfer to ___. The patient received a CT abd/pelvis, which 
showed cholecystitis and displacement of his percutaneous 
cholecystostomy tube (see below). He was initially started on 
meropenem and tigecycline. Infectious disease consulted on ___, 
who recommended continuing meropenem and tigecycline pending 
culture data. A culture from the drain taken by the RN on 
admission grew moderate growth pan-sensitive pseudomonas and 
multidrug resistant E.coli. A second culture from the 
gallbladder drain obtained by interventional radiology ___ 
@ 2:04pm) showed pan-sensitive Enterococcus. A culture drawn 
from his PTBD ___ @ 2:56pm) was showing two types of E.coli 
with varying sensitivies and moderate ___. The patient had 
been afebrile since around noon on ___. Per infectious disease, 
the patient was continued on tigecycline 50 mg IV q12h for a 
total 14-day course (last dose ___. He was discontinued off of 
meropenem and started on ciprofloxacin 500 mg PO BID to cover 
pseudomonas not covered by tigecycline to complete a 14-day 
course as well (last dose ___. No fungal coverage was added 
because ___ was only seen on one culture and he improved 
without fungal coverage. The patient received placement of 
midline on ___ for IV access and was discharged on ___ with 
the midline to receive his IV tigecycline. Per infectious 
disease, he will not require OPAT enrollment or specific safety 
labs since his total course was <14 days from time of discharge. 


# Displaced percutaneous cholecystectomy drain - The patient 
reported that the tubing of his percutaneous cholecystostomy 
drain might have caught onto a kitchen cabinet at home prior to 
his admission. He noted that it was not draining as usual and 
that the dressing around his tube was saturated. The patient 
received a CT abd/pelvis, which showed cholecystitis and 
displacement of his percutaneous cholecystostomy tube. 
Interventional radiology replaced patient's drain successfully 
on ___. His T. bili downtrended from 1.5 to 0.5 on discharge. 
He will be contacted by interventional radiology regarding 
follow-up for this drain.

# Concern for left lower lobe infiltrate - There was a concern 
for a left lower lobe infiltrate on the outside hospital chest 
Xray report. However, the patient had no symptoms of cough or 
respiratory distress, making a pneumonia unlikely. He remained 
without pulmonary symptoms through the remainder of his 
admission. 

CHRONIC ISSUES
==============
# History of Clostridium difficile infection - The patient was 
last C.diff positive on ___. He has been on oral vancomycin 
which was continued 2 weeks beyond his most recent course of IV 
antibiotics. He continued to have loose stools throughout his 
admission and a C.diff was checked, which was negative. Per 
infectious disease, the patient was instructed to continue PO 
vancomycin until his other antibiotics are completed (last dose 
___. 

# Cholangiocarcinoma - Patient has stage IV cholangiocarcinoma, 
unresectable, with last chemotherapy C8D1 gemcitabine and 
cisplatin on ___. The patient was introduced to the 
palliative care team during the hospitalization. There was a 
discussion with the patient by the primary team in regards to 
code status, and the patient stated he wished to be full code at 
this time. Per the patient's outpatient oncologists, Dr. ___ 
___ Dr. ___ be deferred for a few months 
in the setting of acute infections.

# Thrombocytopenia - Patient has history of thrombocytopenia 
over the past year. His platelet count remained stable in

Brief Hospital Course:
___ is a ___ year old man with cholangiocarcinoma on 
surveillance, MDR E. Coli cholangitis and hepatic microabscesses 
s/p PTBD, who presents from home
with fevers and decreased PTBD output. He was found to have MDR 
e coli bacteremia in the setting of cholangitis from a clogged 
PTBD. 

# MDR e coli bacteremia 
# Cholangitis, clogged PTBD
Mr ___ presented with decreased PTBD output and acute onset 
fevers and rigors after his feraheme infusion on ___. He 
immediately presented to the hospital and initial workup was 
remarkable for MDR E coli in ___ bottles. CT A/P showed that his 
hepatic abscesses were stable to improved. He went for PTBD 
exchange with ___ on ___. His PTBD was found to be clogged 
during that procedure so he received an upsized catheter. 

Mr ___ was initially treated with tigecycline, tobramycin, 
and ceftazidime-avibactam under infectious disease guidance. His 
blood cultures finalized on ___ and demonstrated that his MDR E 
coli was sensitive to meropenem. Accordingly, he was 
transitioned to tigecycline and meropenem (to be ertapenem for 
ease of administration on discharge). His tigecycline was 
maintained to cover the subset of MDR e coli that is 
meropenem-resistant and previously grew in his blood culture in 
___.

He underwent PTBD capping trial 2 days prior to discharge, which 
he tolerated well without transaminitis. He will be discharged 
with capped PTBD and plan for routine PTBD exchange ___ with ___. 
 

He had a PICC placed on ___. He will have a repeat MRI liver 
on ___. He will follow up with ID ___. Length of course 
on ertapenem/tigecycline will be determined at that time.

# Bloody PTBD output
On ___, Mr ___ had an episode of ___ cc frank bloody 
output from his PTBD, which occurred in the setting of straining 
to lift a table. It self-resolved with normal bilious flow and 
shortly thereafter his PTBD was capped.

# Metastatic cholangiocarcinoma on surveillance. 
He was treated w/ gem/cis and RT x 7.5 cycles with palliative 
intent. Last received chemo ___. No evidence of disease on q6 
month scans alternating btwn MRI and CT Torso. 

# Anemia, thrombocytopenia: 
He had acute on chronic anemia and thrombocytopenia, which was 
felt to be due to myelosuppression from sepsis/infection. His 
counts improved with antibiotics. Prior to admission, he also 
received the second of 2 fereheme infusions. Repeat iron studies 
were done with ferritin of 198

# Coagulopathy: Near baseline, possibly due to synthetic 
dysfunction from hepatic microabscesses. In addition, is on 
apixaban for PVT which is likely contributing.

Procedure: The procedure, indications, preparation and 
potential complications were explained to the ___, who 
indicated his understanding and signed the corresponding consent 
forms. A physical exam was performed. The ___ was 
administered MAC anesthesia. The ___ was placed in the prone 
position and an endoscope was introduced through the mouth and 
advanced under direct visualization until the third part of the 
duodenum was reached. Careful visualization was performed. The 
procedure was not difficult. The quality of the preparation was 
good. The ___ tolerated the procedure well. There were no 
complications.
Findings:
Esophagus: Limited exam of the esophagus was normal
Stomach: Limited exam of the stomach was normal
Duodenum: Limited exam of the duodenum was normal
Major Papilla: 2 metal stents previously placed in the biliary 
duct were found in the major papilla. The stents were in place 
without any migration.  
Cannulation:  Selective cannulation of both biliary stents was 
successful and deep with a balloon using a free-hand technique. 
Contrast medium was injected resulting in complete 
opacification. 
Fluoroscopic Interpretation of the Biliary Tree: Scout film 
revealed bilateral metal stents. The left sided metal stent was 
cannulated with the balloon. Multiple balloon sweeps were 
performed resulting in extraction of copious amounts of sludge, 
stone material and tumour tissue. Passage of the wire proximal 
to the stent was difficult and there was a possible narrowing 
seen on cholangiogram and thus the decision was made to insert a 
stent. The right sided metal stent was then cannulated with the 
balloon. Multiple balloon sweeps were performed resulting in 
extraction of copious amounts of pus, sludge, stone material and 
tumour tissue. The occlusion cholangiogram revealed no proximal 
filling defects/stricturing. Excellent bile and contrast 
drainage was seen endoscopically and fluoroscopically. 
Procedures: A double pigtail plastic biliary stent was placed 
successfully in the main duct and left main hepatic duct. 
Radiologic interpretation:  I supervised the acquisition and 
interpretation of the fluoroscopic images. The quality of the 
fluoroscopic images was good. The total fluoroscopy time was 
9.9mins.
Impression:

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,

It was a pleasure caring for you at ___ 
___.  You were admitted to the hospital for fever.  
We were concerned that you may have infection or blockage of 
your bile ducts.  Therefore, you were evaluated by the ___ team 
who retrieved a plastic stent in one of your bile ducts and 
cleaned your metal stents.  They found that one of your biliary 
ducts was obstructed.  You subsequently underwent percutaneous 
biliary drain placement with the Interventional Radiology 
service.  You did well with the procedure.  Because of the 
drain, it is normal for you to have some abdominal pain at the 
drain site for several weeks.  Because of your abdominal 
discomfort, we started you on pain medication which you may 
continue when you return home.  We also continued you on 
antibiotics; we found that the bacteria growing in your blood 
stream was actually resistant to the antibiotics you were on at 
home.  Therefore, you will be discharged on an antibiotic called 
meropenem.

Please follow-up with your outpatient providers as instructed 
below.

Thank you for allowing us to participate in your care.  All best 
wishes for your recovery.

Sincerely,
Your ___ medical team

IMAGING:
CHEST PA AND LAT (___): Dense band-like opacities in the 
lower lungs which have a morphology most suggestive of 
atelectasis.  If pneumonia is a continuing possible clinical 
concern, a short-term followup radiographs may be helpful and 
pneumonia is not entiredly excluded. 

CT ABD/PELVIS (___): 
1.  Acute cholecystitis with small contained rupture along the 
hepatic margin of the gallbladder. 
2.  Atrophic left hepatic lobe with stable left and right 
metallic biliary stents and new internal-external right anterior 
biliary drain.  No definite new liver lesion or lymph node with 
persistent soft tissue around stents at hepatic ducts 
confluence. 
3.  Left upper quadrant small bowel segmental dilation is likely 
ileus.  Clinical follow up recommended. 

CT ABD/PELVIS (___): 
1.  Cholecystostomy tube placed yesterday is positioned within 
the gallbladder lumen with no findings of local complication. 
Small amount of new free fluid would be consistent with small, 
not unexpected bile leak during that procedure but if symptoms 
continue, rescanning to assess whether any of this is developing 
into a collection could be performed. Even this amount of bile 
in the peritoneum can be painful. 
2.  Note malposition of distal portion of the right anterior 
internal/external biliary drain coiled back on itself in the 
distal end of the left mental stent, currently not associated 
with recurrent biliary obstruction. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ is a ___ with stage IV cholangiocarcinoma, currently 
on last day of cycle 8 gemcitabine/cisplatin, s/p biliary 
stenting and multiple episodes of GNR bacteremia, who presented 
with recurrent fevers and found to have cholecystitis and 
gallbladder rupture requiring PTC.

# Acute cholangitis w/GB perforation requiring PTC placement c/b 
severe sepsis: Patient was admitted with persistent fever. A CT 
showed acute cholangitis with contained perforation of the 
gallbladder. He was started on IV meropenam. A percutaneous 
cholecystostomy tube was placed. ___, Patient 
became febrile, rigored, had a lactate of 5.5, and was 
transferred to the unit. Fevers/rigors were most likely due to 
transient bacteremic translocation secondary to invasive PTC 
tube procedure given the frankly purulent material expressed 
during drainage or from his cholecystitis. He was treated with 
IV meropenem/vancomycin per ID recommendations. Repeat imaging 
showed no concern for acute perforation or other pathology 
requiring urgent intervention. Cultures obtained during 
cholecystostomy showed e.coli. Antibiotic coverage was narrowed 
to meropenem, which was later changed to Tigecycline as the 
e.coli had only intermediate sensitivity to meropenam. He was 
discharged home with a PICC to complete a 7 day course of 
Tigecycline. Patient was also started on PO vancomycin due to 
his history of e.coli.

# Metastatic cholangiocarcinoma- Last day cycle 8 
gemcitabine/cisplatin. Patient was continued on his home pain 
regimen.

# H/o c.diff: Started on PO vancomycin.

# Hypertension- Continued on atenolol

# BPH- Continued on home terazosin

# Rosacea- Continued on metronidazole cream 

# GERD- Continued on home PPI

Brief Hospital Course:
SUMMARY:
========
Patient is a ___ with a PMH of cholangiocarcinoma (s/p chemo and 
XRT, last in ___, follows w/ oncology, currently undergoing 
surveillance only, no known recurrence), biliary obstruction c/b 
recurrent cholangitis requiring metal stent placement and 
exchanges approximately every ___RCP, history of MDR 
E Coli bacteremia currently on suppressive delafloxacin 
(followed by ID) who initially presented with fever to 103 at 
home concerning for recurrent cholangitis, course complicated by 
acute blood loss during CBD balloon sweep with ERCP iso likely 
portobiliary fistula, now s/p portal vein stenting with ___, 
course further complicated by E coli bacteremia. 

ACTIVE ISSUES:
==============
# E.coli Bloodstream infection
# Cholangitis - Patient presented with symptoms/signs concerning 
for recurrent cholangitis, LFTs were consistent with obstructive 
hepatobiliary pathology. Unfortunately, during ERCP he 
experienced large volume hemorrhage related to likely 
portobiliary fistula and Hb dropped from 11.3 to 7.8. No 
pressors were required, and the patient was stabilized in the 
FICU. Although ERCP was ultimately aborted, patient has improved 
from an infectious standpoint with antibiotics alone, now 
afebrile with stable LFTs. A midline was placed on ___. While 
LFTs uptrended on ___, this was felt to be due to meropenem, 
and no repeat ERCP was indicated at this time. Blood cultures 
were followed, and were last positive with E. coli sensitive to 
meropenem on ___. Per recommendations by Infectious Disease, 
meropenem was started on ___, and was transitioned to ertapenem 
on ___, with the plan to complete a 14 day course of 
antibiotics from the first day of negative cultures (i.e. last 
day of IV ertapenem will be ___. Following this, the 
patient should begin delafloxacin 450mg PO bid + fosfomycin 3g 
PO bid. ___ clinic will call the patient to book a clinic 
appointment in around 3 months following discharge.

# Acute blood loss anemia - The patient experienced hemorrhage 
during ERCP as above. The patient underwent portal vein stenting 
with ___. He received 1 u pRBCs during this admission. Hgb was 
monitored daily and remained stable ___ for the duration of the 
hospitalization.

# Leukopenia
WBC count was noted to be downtrending since ___, WBC 2.7 on 
___. This was thought to most likely be due to a medication 
effect from meropenem. The patient was monitored but did not 
develop new localizing s/s infection. Monitored with daily CBC.

# Stage IV cholangiocarcinoma - Patient received palliative 
chemotherapy in ___ with cisplatin/gemcitabine, ___ and 
imaging have been largely stable. CT A/P this admission did show 
hypodensities in the liver new from prior studies, possibly 
related to acute cholangitis, though cannot rule out disease 
recurrence. No indication to send CA ___ this admission. 
Continued home dronabinol 5 mg BID. A follow up appointment with 
Oncology was made.

CHRONIC/RESOLVED ISSUES:
=======================
# Diarrhea - Patient with reported loose stools on admission. 
This has occurred in the setting of cholangitis for him in the
past. Acute hemorrhage may additionally have caused some
diarrhea. C. diff NEGATIVE. Now having regular BMs.

# Electrolyte derangements (low Phos/Mg)- Monitored and repleted 
daily as needed.

# BPH: Continued home finasteride and tamsulosin.

# Type II Diabetes Mellitus: not on antihyperglycemics, glucose 
was monitored.

# GERD: Continued pantoprazole, consider transition to H2 
blocker
on d/c.

# Post nasal drip: Continued home loratadine, fluticasone. 

# Migraines: Held home atenolol due to acute bleed this 
admission.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
====================
[] The patient should continue ertapenem 1 mg Q24H IV until 
___, to complete 14d from ___ neg BCx.
[] On ___, the patient should begin delafloxacin 450mg PO 
bid + fosfomycin 3g PO bid.
[] The patient will require repeat liver imaging and follow up 
with Oncology. The CTA abd/pelvis obtained on ___ showed 
multiple hypodensities within the liver, the largest measures 
2.6 cm near the right hepatic vein, some of which are new from 
the prior study, which may represent spread of 
cholangiocarcinoma versus sequela from cholangitis.
[] PCP should obtain labs following discharge, including LFTs 
(given elevation this admission, likely due to antibiotics), Hgb 
(due to acute bleeding during this admission), and WBC (due to 
leukopenia at time of discharge).
[] ___ clinic will call the patient to set up a clinic 
appointment in 3 months. (The appointment originally scheduled 
for the week following discharge has been cancelled.)
[] The patient should continue to monitor closely for signs of 
cholangitis (fever, abdominal pain, jaundice).

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ is a ___ male with history of DMII, BPH, 
recurrent C. diff, and inoperable cholangiocarcinoma s/p 
gemcitabine/cisplatin and Cyberknife in ___ complicated by 
recurrent biliary obstruction/cholangitis with MDR E. coli,
biliary sepsis and multiple ERCPs/PTBDs who presents with 
fatigue.

#Cholangiocarcinoma.
#Likely metastatic L3 lesion.
Currently on surveillance with Dr. ___. Treated with gem/cis 
and RT, last received chemo ___. A lumbar MRI was obtained 
and was concerning for possible metastatic lesion. He had a 
biopsy on ___ which was pending on discharge. Gram stain was 
negative. Discussed with ID who felt given no change of symptoms 
with empiric course of abx less likely infectious etiology. He 
has follow up with Dr. ___ ___ for further 
evaluation/management of possible metastatic lesion. 

# Fatigue/Concern for possible recurrent cholangitis: Infectious 
work up was unremarkable except for mildly elevated LFTs (ALT 
and Alk phos). Pt denied any localizing symptoms and was 
ambulating frequently in the halls.  Blood cultures were NGTD. 
Urine culture ___ was negative. Bile culture ___ grew out 
mixed bacterial flora. TSH was 0.88 and cortisol was 13.1. ID 
consulted and pt was ruled out for tick borne infections with 
negative lyme and anaplasma serologies. Prior to negative 
studies he was briefly placed on empiric doxycycline which was 
discontinued with negative studies.  CMV VL was negative and 
MRCP showed some findings concerning for acute on chronic 
cholangitis.  Pt was treated empirically with Meropenem for 4 
days with no improvement of symptoms. Gram stain of lumbar 
lesion was negative. Discussed with ID who felt given lack of 
improvement of symptoms unlikely infectious and recommended 
discontinued abx course and resume prophylactic Bactrim  which 
he was discharged back on at discharge. 

#Pancytopenia: Possible leukopenia due to chronic Bactrim 
therapy. However appears to get thrombocytopenia and leukopenia 
with previous infections.  This was discussed with his primary 
oncologist, Dr. ___ evaluate blood smear and felt it was 
consistent with previous smears. B12 was normal at 821. Retic 
index-0.11 consistent with hypoproliferation. Continue to 
monitor as an outpatient.

# Malnutrition: Reports appetite and weight at baseline. 
Continued home dronabinol

# Iron-Deficiency Anemia: Hb actually higher than baseline 
although outpatient local labs concerning for iron deficiency 
(ferritin 7, iron 22, TIBC 390). Repeat iron studies- ferritin 
13, TIBC 410, iron 51. He recieved 2 doses of ferric gluconate 
while intpt.

# Portal Vein Thrombus- MRCP revealed resolution of previously 
seen right portal venous thrombus and apixaban was held for 
biopsy. Discussed with his oncologist, Dr. ___ 
recommended to continue anticoagulation. He was continued on his 
home apixaban on discharge. 

# BPH- Continue home finasteride and Tamsulosin

# Allergic Rhinitis- Continue home loratadine and fluticasone

# GERD- Continue home protonix 

#insomnia
#anxiety- He was trialed on trazadone during hospitalization 
with no relief. He received a dose of Ativan with improvement of 
symptoms which was continued for his anxiety and insomnia. He 
was advised this was suboptimal especially in his age group. 
Given his symptoms and improvement with Ativan he requested to 
continue this on discharge so he was given a script on 
discharge. 

Transition issues:
[ ] f/u lumbar biopsy
[ ] consider repeat CBC in a week to continue to monitor 
pancytopenia
[ ] consider further titrating/adjusting anxiety medication, 
would try to wean off ativan

History of Present Illness:
___ year old male with history of stage IV cholangiocarcinoma, 
s/p biliary stenting, C7D17 gemcitabine/cisplatin presenting 
with fever to 101.2 at home. Patient had chemotherapy on ___ 
and felt very well afterwards.  Yesterday he felt great to the 
point where he was doing chores around the house and took out 
the trash.  Just before bedtime last night he felt a little off 
and asked his wife to take his temperature.  At that time he was 
afebrile.  He went to sleep and endorsed nightsweats overnight 
to the point where he took off all the heavy covers.  This 
morning when he woke up he just felt "bad."  There were no 
specific symptoms he could identify.  He did not have any 
chills/rigors but he did have a fever to 101.2.  His temperature 
transiently dropped to 99 but then increased again to 101.0 so 
patient presented to the ED.  

During this time, patient denies any abdominal pain, N/V.  He 
always has loose stools but has not had any unusual diarrhea.  
He has no urinary symptoms.  He has no true cough but does have 
phlegm that causes him to clear his throat frequently.  He had a 
cold in ___ and this has been the case ever since then-- he 
denies any throat pain.    

Of note, patient had an admission ___ with fevers and 
elevated Tbili. He had a CT abdomen which was concerning for 
stent obstruction, however as bilirubin improved on its own and 
cultures were negative, ERCP and further intervention was 
deferred. 

In ED, initial vitals were 100 87 126/58 97% on RA. Labs were 
notable for AST 87 and ALT 52, with Tbili 1.0 and AP 102, lipase 
28. WBC 6.0 and alctate 2.0.  Urinalysis and CXR without 
evidence of infection.  RUQ ultrasound was performed and showed 
on wet read unchanged biliary ductal dilatation, gallbladder 
sludge and gallbladder wall thickening without hydropic changes, 
also similar to prior abdominal ultrasound. After blood cultures 
were drawn, patient received ceftriaxone and metronidazole for 
presumed cholangitis and was admitted to ___ for further 
management.    
 
Review of Systems:  
(+) Per HPI  
(-) Denies recent weight loss or gain. Denies headache, sinus 
tenderness, rhinorrhea or congestion. Denies chest pain or 
tightness, palpitations, lower extremity edema. Denies cough, 
shortness of breath, or wheezes. Denies nausea, vomiting, 
diarrhea, constipation, abdominal pain, melena, hematemesis,

Brief Hospital Course:
___ yr old male with stage IV cholangiocarcinoma previously 
treated with chemoradiation now on active surveillance since 
___ who was admitted with concern for recurrent cholangitis and 
biliary obstruction.

Biliary Obstruction
- The patient was started on antibiotics initially with 
meropenum, given recent culture results, for concern for 
cholangitis. ___ was consult and performed a cholangiogram which 
showed that his PTC was draining fine but his PTBD was 
obstructed and likely the cause of his pain, nausea, and mild 
temperature elevation so this was replaced. The following day 
the PTBD was capped as it has been previously and the patient 
tolerated this well with no pain, nausea, or increase in 
bilirubin. ID was consulted and did not feel the patient needed 
further antibiotic therapy because his course seemed consistent 
with a biliary obstruction without cholangitis. He will have 
home care to assist with his drain care as an outpatient.
 
Cholangiocarcinoma
- Not currently receiving treatment. He will follow up with his 
primary oncologist as an outpatient.

Thromobcytopenia - longstanding, at recent baseline.
