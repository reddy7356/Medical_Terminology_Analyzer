ACUTE ISSUES:

# Fever: Unclear etiology. Definite concern for a urinary source 
in the setting of recent urine culture with ESBL E. coli, as 
well as dysuria with suprapubic tenderness; however, urinalysis 
is completely unremarkable. Urine culture still pending. CXR 
clear so little concern for pneumonia. Fever and chills raises 
concern for influenza, but PCR negative. Differential diagnosis 
for fever in this patient also includes cholangitis given her 
known biliary strictures s/p stenting although clinical picture 
does not quite fit with this, given lack of abdominal pain and 
normal LFTs. Treated with ertapenem in the clinic with one dose. 
Received meropenem in house for 2 days. Discharged to continue 
ertapenem at home for 5 more days. 

# Pancreatic cancer: Stage IIA. Being treated with neoadjuvant 
gemcitabine and abraxane, now C3D21. Patient has been tolerating 
treatment well. Further plans per outpatient oncologist.

Date of Birth:  ___             Sex:   F
 
Service: SURGERY
 
Allergies: 
No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions
 
Attending: ___.
 
Chief Complaint:
Pancreatic cancer
 
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
___: 
1. Extended Radical pancreaticoduodenectomy for locally-advanced
pancreatic cancer s/p preoperative chemoradiation, -22 modifier
2. Resection of base of transverse mesocolon and extended
vascular dissection of the small bowel mesentery for presumed T4
cancer

 
History of Present Illness:
Ms. ___ is a ___ woman who has a history of acute
pancreatitis ___ ___.  An MRCP at that time showed
subcentimeter cystic lesions consistent with intraductal
papillary mucinous neoplasia.  She recovered and went on to
undergo a six-month surveillance CT scan, which showed a double
duct sign and a 3 x 2 cm pancreatic mass.  Abdominal pain
followed as did the CT scan, and she was admitted with worsening
pain and fatigue and also noticed an unintentional 35-pound
weight loss over the past six months.  She went on to develop
obstructive jaundice, was seen here at ___,
biliary stenting was achieved and biopsies on brushings were
positive for adenocarcinoma, consistent with a primary 
pancreatic
head adenocarcinoma.

She went on to develop a CT angiogram need, which was performed
on ___ revealing borderline resectable with a 
180-degree
involvement of the pancreatic head adenocarcinoma, unfortunately
at the posterior aspects of both the superior mesenteric artery
and superior mesenteric vein extending medially to primary
branches.

She underwent neoadjuvant chemoradiation therapy, which she has 
seemingly
responded to.  She has been under the tight watchful eye of Dr. 
___ who has been shooting her through her maximal 
chemotherapy regimen and her CT
imaging revealed some tumor response, but there is an area 
around
the root of mesentery and the superior mesenteric artery that
remains equivocal and perhaps could be the final red-light for
her to have resection. She now presents for her scheduled 
pancreaticoduodenectomy. 
 
Past Medical History:
Pancreatitis ___
HTN
hyperthyroidism, s/p treatment, now euthyroid

 
Social History:
___
Family History:
Her mother had colon cancer at ___ but she declined therapy. 
Her father was killed by Pol Pot at a young age. 
 
Physical Exam:
Prior to discharge:
VS: 98.8, 87, 107/57, 18, 99% RA

covered with DSD. Umbilical laparoscopic incision covered with 
DSD. RUQ with ___ drain to bulb suction and with small amount of 
bilious output, site with drain sponge and c/d/i. 
Extr: Warm

 
Pertinent Results:
Imaging: 
___: CT A/P
1.  Status post Whipple procedure with two gas-containing fluid 
collections ___ the liver concerning for hepatic abscesses.  
Please note that Surgicel use can have a similar appearance, 
thus correlation with the operative procedure is necessary. 
2.  Additional loculated fluid collection alongside the main 
portal vein and SMV without internal gas could be a 
postoperative seroma or abscess. 
3.  Other less organized fluid collections ___ the pancreatectomy 
bed and 
anterior abdominal wall may be postsurgical such as seroma, 
although infection is not excluded. 
4.  Mild bilateral hydronephrosis and hydroureter without 
evidence of focal obstruction, likely attributable to fullness 
of the bladder at the time of exam. 

___ Interventional procedure: 
FINDINGS:  
Limited preprocedure CT scan of the upper abdomen demonstrates a 
fluid 
collection ___ the right hepatic lobe containing gas bubbles 
measuring 
approximately 2.6 x 3.4 cm, which was targeted for drainage.  
There is a 
hepaticojejunostomy and evidence of recent Whipple procedure 
with multiple 
surgical staples and sutures ___ place.  There are bilateral 
breast prostheses 
and partially visualized posterior fusion of the lower lumbar 
spine.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ was admitted to ___ following a 
pancreaticoduodenectomy procedure on ___. The procedure went 
without complications, although required difficult dissection of 
the vasculature of the small bowel mesentery. Please see 
operative notes for further details. Post-op she had an epidural 
___ place, NGT and foley. ___ the PACU, she was hypotensive and 
received 1 bolus of LR and 500cc of 5% albumin. Her BP responded 
well. Her Hct had transiently dropped post-op, most likely 
dilutional, because came back up to baseline on POD1 morning. 
Her epidural was split on POD2 and her NGT was removed. She was 
advanced to sips the following day and passing flatus. On POD4, 
her epidural was removed and she was transitioned to oral pain 
medications. Her foley was removed and she failed to void and 
her foley was replaced. She had some drainage and fat necrosis 
of the incision site and 8 staples were removed and the area was 
packed with a wet-to-dry dressing. On POD 5 she received 1U PRBC 
for a Hct of 23.3. She was ambulating well with physical 
therapy. Throughout this time, she was complaining of 
significant pain with a great deal of difficulty achieving 
adequate pain control. On POD 5 she was advanced to a regular 
diet. She was complaining of foul smelling urine and a UA, UCx 
was sent, both of which were positive for ecoli and klebsiella. 
She was started on a 5-day course of cipro. Given her increasing 
pain, she was started on an aggressive bowel regimen alone with 
an increase ___ her pain regimen. She was hypernatremic and 
placed on a free water restriction with adequate decrease ___ Na. 
On POD 10, given her slow progress and increasing pain, a CT A/P 
was ordered. She was given PO contrast and IV. When she came 
back from CT, she developed rigors, chills, no fevers, and 
severe nausea. An NGT was placed with minimal output but 
subjective improvement of symptoms.  The following day, her NGT 
was d/c'd and her diet was slowly advanced to a regular diet 
which she tolerated well. Blood cultures were obtained during 
her rigors and chills which grew out e.coli. CT scan showed 2 
intra-hepatic fluid collections and a small extra-hepatic one. 
She was started on zosyn. She went to ___ on ___ for drain 
placement. Bilious fluid came out and a drain was kept ___ place. 
The lateral portion of her wound was also opened for additional 
drainage and packing. ID was consulted given the setting of a 
port as well as the IV nurses notified. ID recommended switching 
to meropenem (started on ___  for a total of 2 weeks after the 
last positive blood culture and a gentamicin lock ___ the port. 
It was decided to keep the port for now given to clear evidence 
of seeding of the actual port. She continued to have pain 
control issues and was started on a 2-day standing course of 
toradol. She was ambulating early and without difficulty. 
Throughout this time, she was tolerating a regular diet without 
issues. 
At the time of discharge, the patient was doing well, afebrile 
with stable vital signs. The patient was tolerating a regular 
diet, ambulating, voiding without assistance, and pain was well 
controlled. The patient received discharge teaching and 
follow-up instructions with understanding verbalized and 
agreement with the discharge plan.
