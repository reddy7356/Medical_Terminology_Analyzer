none
 
History of Present Illness:
Ms. ___ is a ___ lady with AFib on Warfarin, ___ 
(EF55-60%), h/o TIA, dementia, and CKD who presented to ___ 
___ with agitation and was transferred due to hypotension.

Per daughter, in early ___ the patient was living 
independently with her husband, fully mobile.  In late ___ 
she was hospitalized and since then she has had a progressive 
decline in mental status (diagnosed with dementia)and also 
physical condition (worsened peripheral edema, now can only walk 
a few steps with a walker, is incontinent).  She has been back 
and forth between rehab and the hospital.  At one point, family 
tried to see if she could function at ___ but she 
could not.  Currently she stays at ___ at ___ and is 
usually oriented x person, place.  However, on the day of 
presentation she was agitated, screaming loudly at staff, and 
was only oriented x1, prompting her to be sent to the ED.

In ___ VS were: T98.2, HR 151 (AFib), BP 
96/79, RR 25, POx 78%RA.  Due to RVR she received Diltiazem 5mg 
IV, and she dropped her BP slightly so received 250cc NS.  There 
was concern for hypoxia, but there was difficulty obtaining a 
peripheral pulse ox.  ABG on 100%NRB was ph 7.5/pCO2 25/PO2 316. 
 Labs were notable for WBC 8.8, Hct 34.5 (above baseline), BUN 
55/Cr 2.4 (baseline Cr 1.4). INR 4.  BNP 16562.  CXR showed left 
pleural effusion, could not r/o pneumonia.  She was given Lasix 
10mg IV and was started on BiPAP for CHF.  In addition, she 
received Vancomycin, Ceftriaxone, Azithromycin.  She was 
transferred due to hypotension.

In the ___ ED, initial VS were:  T 98.5, HR 94, BP 89/40, RR 
20, POx 86% 4L NC.  BP fluctuated widely, with SBP 45-90.  Again 
O2 sat was difficult to obtain, but with good pleth was 100% on 
NRB.  She was broadened to include Metronidazole in case of 
intraabdominal source of infection.  She received 3L IVF.  
Bedside ultrasound showed only a trace/physiologic pericardial 
effusion, good pump function.  EKG showed some peaked T waves 
anteriorly, with ___levation in V2, no reciprocal 
depression.  Patient was confirmed to be DNR/DNI; no central 
line was placed but she was started on peripheral 
Norepinephrine.  VS prior to transfer were: T 97.8, HR 109, BP 
90/palp, RR 20, POx 100% NRB.
 
On arrival to the MICU, patient is screaming and agitated.  She 
is asking for water.  Denies any fever, cough, abdominal pain.  
Breathing feels comfortable.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ was a ___ lady with AFib on Warfarin, dCHF 
(EF55-60%), h/o TIA, dementia, and CKD who presented to ___ 
___ with shortness of breath, was found to have intermittent 
hypoxia, and was admitted to the MICU due to hypotension.  
Presentation was consistent with septic shock, possibly due to 
severe pneumonia.  Per goals of care discussion, invasive 
measures were not desired by patient or family, including 
central access or invasive blood pressure monitoring.  Attempt 
was initially made to treat with peripheral vasopressors, 
antibiotics, and fluids, but patient's clinical status

History of Present Illness:
___ year old female with a past medical history of atrial 
fibrillation on warfarin, congestive heart failure (subtype 
unknown), transient ischemic attack, dementia (likely vascular 
given prior TIA), microscopic colitis, chronic  kidney disease 
with a baseline creatinine of 1.8 who presents as transfer 
patient from ___ for presumed digoxin toxicity. Patient gives 
only limited history as she is confused at baseline. She states 
that she is unsure why she is in the hospital. She does report a 
fall on the morning PTA while standing in her kitchen. She is 
not sure but thinks she may have tripped over someone's foot. 
She does not believe she hit her head and does not believe she 
lost consciousness. She currently denies headache. She denies 
chest pain, shortness of breath and palpitations, but does 
report she has felt subjectively warm. She denies cough and 
dysuria. She endorses poor PO intake recently. Her initial 
evaluation occurred at ___ where she had a CT scan of her head 
& neck and was found to have a K of 2.7, Cr 3.5 (baseline 1.8), 
bun-85, dig lvl of 1.6, lactate of 2.8, hct 44, wbc-7.5 and inr 
of 4.0. She received ___ Eq of K and a small dose of  morphine. 
After her head & neck CT were negative for acute pathology she 
was ___ transferred to ___.
  
In the ED initial vitals were T 97.3, HH 44, BP 108/37, RR 20, 
however subsequent blood pressures fell to the ___ systolic. She 
additionally had 2 episodes of watery non bloody diarrhea. HR 
remained in the ___. EKG initially showed RBBB but 
subsequently showed LBBB. She was evaluated by toxicology who 
recommended one half vial of digoxin immune FAB. She also got 1 
L of IV with improvement in BP and HR. She was additionally seen 
by electrophysiology who did not feel hypotension was clearly 
related to dig toxicity but recommended admission to cardiology 
for monitoring and further evaluation. Vitals on transfer were T 
98.5, HR 67, BP 117/50, RR 18 and O2 sat 96%.  
 
On arrival to the floor she is confused by pain free and asking 
to go home.

ECG ___
Atrial fibrillation with ventricular premature complexes. Left 
axis deviation. Left bundle-branch block. Non-specific 
repolarization abnormalities. Possible inferior wall myocardial 
infarction of indeterminate age. Compared to the previous 
tracing right bundle-branch block has now been replaced with 
left bundle-branch block and repolarization abnormalities are 
less prominent.

CXR ___
IMPRESSION:
1.  Blunting of the right costophrenic angle is similar to prior 
and may
represent small effusion vs scarring.
2.  Previously described 4 mm right apical nodular density is 
obscured by an external lead.  As before, chest CT should be 
considered for further
evaluation.
3.  No pneumothorax

ECHOCARDIOGRAM ___
The left atrium is elongated. The right atrium is moderately 
dilated. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. 
Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and regional/global 
systolic function are normal (LVEF >55%). There is no 
ventricular septal defect. The right ventricular cavity is 
dilated with focal hypokinesis of the mid to distal free wall 
(sparing the base and very apex - ?prior RV injury? RV 
cardiomyopathy?). There is abnormal septal motion/position. The 
diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels are 
normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but 
aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. 
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is mild 
mitral valve prolapse. An eccentric, posteriorly directed jet of 
mild to moderate (___) mitral regurgitation is seen. The 
tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Severe [4+] 
tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary artery 
systolic hypertension. [In the setting of at least moderate to 
severe tricuspid regurgitation, the estimated pulmonary artery 
systolic pressure may be underestimated due to a very high right 
atrial pressure.] There is no pericardial effusion.

given prior TIA), microscopic colitis, CKD (baseline cr of 1.8) 
who presents as transfer patient from ___ for presumed digoxin 
toxicity.

# PRESYNCOPE/FALL: Mrs. ___ fall in her kitchen the morning 
prior to admission was likely multifactorial. Per her family she 
ambulates quite well at home with a very limited fall history; 
however, her baseline confusion certainly puts her at risk for a 
mechanical fall. On her presenting vitals she was bradycardic 
and hypotensive which likely contributed to unsteadiness or an 
presyncopal symptoms. Her bradycardia was secondary to digoxin 
toxicity. Her hypotension was secondary to hypovolemia and 
bradycardia. After achieving hemodynamic stability with 
intravenous volume resusitation and Digibind, Mrs. ___ did 
not experience any falls or presyncopal episodes. Orthostatics 
on discharge were within normal limtits. Coumadin was continued 
on discharge despite her fall, given CHADS2 score of 5 (see 
below).

# DIGOXIN TOXICITY: Mrs. ___ presented to ___ with 
hypotension and bradycardia to the ___. She was found to be 
in acute renal failure and is known to be on chronic digoxin 
therapy. Her digoxin level was at the upper limit of the 
therapeutic window (1.6). Her electrocardiogram demonstrated a 
new right bundle branch block. Toxicology evaluated the patient 
in the ED and recommended ___ vial of Digibind. The patient 
responded well to the therapy with resolution of her bradycardia 
and regression of the RBBB on her ECG. 

# METABOLIC ACIDOSIS: Mrs. ___ was admitted with a serum 
bicarbonate of 11 which decreased to 8 on the second day of her 
admission. An ABG was performed which showed a primary metabolic 
acidosis and primary respiratory alkalosis. The delta/delta 
ratio suggested a mixed anion gap/non-anion gap metabolic 
acidosis. Chronic diarrhea is the likely culprit of her non-AG 
metabolic acidosis. Acute renal failure and a minor lactic 
acidosis likely created the anion gap metabolic acidosis. 
Screens for salicylates was negative. A urine anion gap 
calculated on the third day of admission was consistent with a 
gastrointestinal source of the non-AG metabolic acidosis. 
Bicarbonate supplementation was given TID to lessen the 
patient's minute ventilation requirements for compensation.  
Please repeat labs on ___ at ___, and stop Nabicarb if 
HCO3>20.  Patient will follow up with Dr. ___ 
(___).

# ATRIAL FIBRILLATION: Mrs. ___ has a long standing history 
of atrial fibrillation. ___ (CHF, HTN, age, TIA). Prior 
to admission, her only rate control agent was digoxin. Digoxin 
was discontinued upon admission and after resolution of 
bradycardia metoprolol 12.5 mg BID was started for rate control. 
During the initial 24 hours of metoprolol therapy there were 
several episodes of breakthrough RVR, these did not occur on 
subsequent days of therapy. While at rest Mrs. ___ 
experiences occasional bradycardic events into the ___ and 
pauses <3 seconds. As long as she remains asymptomatic no 
further intervention is needed. Discharged on Toprol XL 25mg 
daily. INR on discharge was 2.2. Please recheck on ___.
 
# CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE: On admission the subtype of Mrs. 
___ heart failure was unknown. She did not have evidence of 
pulmonary edema or signs of right heart failure. An 
echocardiogram was obtained on ___ which showed a preserved 
EF, RV wall motion abnormalities and severe TR. Her echo is most 
consistent with chronic, right sided congestive heart failure. 
Troponin (0.06) and CKMB (11) were slightly elevated on 
admission. MB index was 5. These elevations were likely the 
results of acute renal failure and stressed myocardium. 
 
# ACUTE ON CHRONIC RENAL FAILURE: Mrs. ___ has chronic renal 
insufficiency of unknown etiology. Her baseline creatinine is 
1.8. She was admitted with a serum creatinine of 3.3 and a BUN 
of 85. Her urine sodium was <10. The acute component of her 
renal failure is most certainly pre-renal azotemia. With 
intravenous fluids the patient's creatinine trended down to 1.4. 


# HYPERNATREMIA: Secondary to poor PO intake and potentially 
diarrhea. While intravenous access was established the patient 
received volume repletion with NS and subsequently D5W ___ NS. 
Patient was able to maintain normal Na with PO intake at 
discharge.
  
# DIARRHEA: Mrs. ___ has a history of microscopic colitis. 
Her only therapy on admission was PRN loperamide. She apparently 
has been treated with Endocort in the past, with good effect. 
Her diarrhea was limited during her admission; averaging 2, 
small to large bowel movements per day. She has an outpatient 
followup scheduled with her gastroenterologist at ___ 
___ (Dr. ___. C.difficile PCR assay performed was 
negative.
 
# LEUKOCYTOSIS: Mrs. ___ presented afebrile with a white 
count of 11.4. Initial infectious work up included CXR, UA and 
C.difficile PCR assay. No infection was revealed with the 
initial workup and the patient remained afebrile throughout her 
hospitalization. The leukocytosis was likely secondary to a 
systemic stress reaction.
 
# CONFUSION: The patient has baseline confusion according to her 
family. She likely has vascular dementia or Alzheimer's disease. 
She developed occasional agitiation, but overall was pleasant. 
During her hospital stay she was somewhat more confused than at 
home likely secondary to environmental factors. At this point we 
believe the supervision of a short term nursing facility is the 
safest option at discharge.

# Transitional issues:
- Code status: Full code
- Follow up with Dr. ___ PCP (please arrange on discharge 
from ___)
