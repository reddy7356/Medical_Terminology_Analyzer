Microbiology:
Urine culture (___): no growth
Blood culture (___): no growth to date

Imaging:
* TTE (___): The left atrium is moderately dilated. There is 
mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity 
size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%). No masses 
or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. Right ventricular 
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. No large masses or 
vegetations are seen on the aortic valve, but cannot be fully 
excluded due to suboptimal image quality and heavy valve 
calcification. There is moderate to severe aortic valve stenosis 
(area 0.8 cm2). Moderate (2+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The 
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. No mass or 
vegetation is seen on the mitral valve. There is systolic 
anterior motion of the mitral valve leaflets. Moderate (2+) 
mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are 
mildly thickened. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. 
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There 
is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion. IMPRESSION: Mild 
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved global and 
regional biventricular systolic function. Moderate to severe 
calcific aortic stenosis. Moderate aortic regurgitation. 
Moderate mitral regurgitation. Moderate tricuspid regurgitation. 
Moderate pulmonary hypertension. Compared with the prior study 
(images reviewed) of ___, severity of mitral, aortic, and 
tricuspid regurgitation has increased. The other findings appear 
similar.  

* TEE (___): Mild spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the body 
of the left atrium and left atrial appendage. No mass/thrombus 
is seen in the left atrium or left atrial appendage. No atrial 
septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. Overall left 
ventricular systolic function is normal. Right ventricular 
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. There are complex 
(>4mm) atheroma in the aortic arch. There are simple atheroma in 
the descending thoracic aorta. There are three aortic valve 
leaflets, which are severely thickened/deformed. A small (0.5 x 
0.4 cm) echodense, slightly mobile mass is seen on the aortic 
valve, which prolapses into the left ventricular outflow tract 
during diastole, suggestive of a chronic vegetation or severe 
degenerative disease of the aortic valve. Significant aortic 
stenosis is present (not quantified). An eccentric, 
anteriorly-directed jet of moderate (2+) aortic regurgitation is 
seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. No mass or 
vegetation is seen on the mitral valve. Moderate (2+) mitral 
regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly 
thickened. No vegetation/mass is seen on the pulmonic valve. 
There is no pericardial effusion. IMPRESSION: Probable aortic 
valve endocarditis. Significant calcific aortic stenosis. 
Moderate aortic regurgitation. Moderate mitral regurgitation. No 
intracardiac thrombus seen.  

* CT head (___): Limited study secondary to exaggerated 
cervical lordosis, and difficulty positioning normally within 
the scanner. Focal right parietal hypodensity could represent 
subacute or chronic infarction, but without prior comparisons, 
chronicity cannot be determined. Alternatively, this could 
represent extension of chronic microangiopathic change, although 
there is relatively little similar change seen elsewhere in the 
brain. Least likely would be edema from an underlying lesion. 
MRI recommended for further characterization.

* MRI/MRA (___): Acute infarction in the right parietal lobe. 
Markedly limited MRA, no definite area of high-grade stenosis 
seen.

 
Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ is a ___ man with a history of CAD s/p 4 
vessel CABG, severe aortic stenosis, type 2 DM, HTN and chronic 
anemia presenting with a drop in hematocrit and decreased urine 
output according to reports from his nursing home, now with new 
right parietal infarction but now focal neuro deficits.  
.  
#) CVA- On the evening of ___ the patient noted a new 
headache, slurred speech and left sided weakness.  An MRI 
revealed an acute area of R parietal infarction.  He was 
evaluated by neurology and placed on aspirin.  This area of 
infarction likely represents embolic stroke from uncertain 
source (carotid artery vs aortic valve vs complex atheroma on 
aortic arch), could also represent septic embolus given possible 
aortic valve vegetation identified on TEE (mass is mobile and 
prolapses and could be vegetation or calcium from degerative 
valvular disease).  TEE also revealed complex atheroma in aortic 
arch, and the patient was placed on plavix in place of aspirin 
as per neuro recs.  Consideration may be considered to give him 
both aspirin and plavix. The Neurology team also recommends 
considering beginning anticoagulation in this patient with 
multiple risk factors with a goal INR of ___ once the IV 
vancomycin course has been completed; however the risks of 
anticoagulation should be weighed against his risk of further 
bleeding from the GI tract.  At this time the patient is without 
focal neurological deficits. He should follow up with Dr. ___ 
in the department of Neurology in approximately one month; 
please call ___ for an appointment.
.  
#) Anemia- The patient has a known chronic anemia and is guaiac 
positive during this admission. He has been evaluated by the 
gastroenterology team in the past without definite source found. 
During this admission, the patient has received 4 units PRBC 
with an improvement in Hct from 21.5 to 29.2 on the day of 
discharge. Prior to discharge, the patient was changed from 
aspirin 81 mg to plavix 75 mg at the recommendation of 
Neurology. He should be monitored for any worsening GI bleeding 
as the plavix may place him at increased risk (compared to 
aspirin alone). He is no longer complaining of any weakness.
.  
#) Renal failure- Evidence of both pre- and post-renal 
components, with reported decreased PO intake and BPH causing 
urinary retention.  BUN and Cr improving and is currently at 
baseline, vancomycin being dosed at appropriate renal level.  
Finasteride was continued for BPH, and diuretics were held for 
volume repletion.  A foley catheter was placed and in's and 
out's were monitored.  ___ was D/C'ed on ___ with adequate 
urine output noted after it was removed.  A decreased dose of 
lisinopril was restarted at discharge. A creatinine should be 
checked with his other labs within a few days of going to rehab.
.  
#) Leukocytosis- patient has had white count fluctuating between 
8 and 12 since admission. He is afebrile, without focal signs of 
infection, NGTD on blood cultures, urine culture negative, no 
cough or rhinorrhea.  
.  
#) CHF- ___ aortic stenosis. Patient currently euvolemic, is 
aware of condition and has refused surgery in the past.  EF on 
repeat echo this admission >55% with extensive aortic and mitral 
regurg.  Diuretics were held during hospitalization without 
signs of pulmonary or peripheral edema. Should consider 
restarting lasix once blood pressures stable. He should follow 
up with his cardiologist regarding these medication changes 
within one to two months.
.  
#) Endocarditis- the patient was started on IV vancomycin during 
his previous hospital admission when he was found to have strep 
viridans bacteremia (patient with penicillin allergy), though 
vegetation was never definitively seen on TTE.  Repeat TEE on 
this admission showed a mass that may be an aortic vegetation.  
The patient was previously receiving IV vancomycin, renally 
dosed at 1000 mg Q48H.  As creatinine improved, vancomycin 
dosing changed to q24h. Last day of vancomycin to be ___.  
He has infectious disease follow-up as per discharge planning.
.  
#) HTN- Antihypertensive medications were held immediately 
following confirmation of CVA for goal systolic blood pressure > 
140 to maintain cerebral perfusion. At discharge, after 
discussion with Neurology fellow, lisinopril 10 mg daily 
restarted. He should have a repeat creatinine and electrolyte 
check on ___ with lisinopril dose adjusted accordingly. His 
goal blood pressure for the next 2 weeks should be 130 systolic. 
Other antihypertensives can be restarted on a phased basis (one 
at a time) over the next ___ weeks.
.  
#) DM type 2- well-controlled, complicated by mild peripheral 
neuropathy (decreased vibration sense on R vs L).  Glucose has 
been controlled by sliding scale insulin as inpatient, and can 
restart glyburide at rehab.  SSI should continue at rehab.
.  
#) Hypercholesterolemia- patient was continued on home meds 
(simvastatin 20 mg daily) 
.  
#) Dyspepsia/GERD- patient was complaining of reflux at nursing 
home, placed on PPI with improvement. 
.   
#)Prophylaxis- heparin SC while nonambulatory, PPI, bowel 
regimen  
.

# Valves: Patient has severe Aortic stenosis, with a valve area 
of 0.8cm2 and regurigation of all valves. (per ECHO on ___. 
 Patient was evaluated for CT surgery during this admission, and 
surgery determined that he will likely not be a candidate for 
surgery given his recent CVA and overall poor prognosis for 
recovery.  He is not a candidate for valvuloplasty due to the 
recent endocarditis (small vegetation still seen after 6 weeks

outpatient cardiologist Dr. ___ is interested in pursuing a 
transcutaneous valve replacement at ___, and he 
will be contacting Mr. ___ about this option in the near 
future. 
.
# Acute on chronic diastolic heart failure.  Patient has a 
history of diastolic heart failure.  His dose of Lasix had been 
decreased in light of his recent CVA, in order to increase 
cerebral perfusion.  A CXR on admission demonstrated pulmonary 
edema, and a BNP was >7000.  Per neurology, the patient's SBP no 
longer needs to be elevated, so he was started back on his home 
dose of Lasix on ___.  He was also continued on his 
lisinopril, and the dose was increased on ___.  Patient 
improved clinically and on physical exam, and by discharge, he 
was satting 95% on RA.  
.
# CAD: Patient has a h/o CABG.  Troponins were elevated on 
admission and reached a peak of 0.96.  It was decided that the 
patient would not undergo cardiac catheterization in light of 
his recent stroke but would rather be managed medically.  
Patient was continued on ASA, simvastatin, Plavix, and he was 
started on Metoprolol 12.5 mg BID. 
.
#. HTN:  Pt was admitted with SBP 190s.  He was started on a 
Nitro drip in the ED, which was discontinued on ___. Per 
neurology recommendations, patient's SBP should ideally be ~120. 
 Patient was started on Metoprolol, his lisinopril dose was 
increased, and he was restarted on Lasix on ___.  His blood 
pressure was monitored while in the hospital.
.
#. Bradycardic episodes:  Patient had episodes of bradycardia 
and nonsustained ventricular tachycardia. Pt has a known RBBB 
and primary AV conduction delay.  Patient was asymptommatic 
throughout these episodes.  He was monitored throughout his 
hospital stay and did not have any acute events.   
.
#. DM Type II:  Patient has a h/o DM2.  He is currently on 
glyburide at home.  He was maintained on an insulin sliding 
scale while in the hospital.  He is also currently on 
Ciprofloxacin (last dose ___, so he was instructed to 
restart his glyburide at home after he has finished his course 
of Cipro.  
 
#. Chronic renal insufficiency:  Patient's baseline Cr is 1.4, 
and his Cr on admission was 1.8.  Patient's Cr was followed each 
day, and it returned to his baseline of 1.4 with Lasix 20 mg PO 
each day.

CHEST (PA & LAT)

Reason: eval for change 

UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
___ year old man with positive blood cultures, abnl CT 
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
eval for change 
HISTORY: Positive blood cultures with abnormal CT.

FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of ___, there is 
persistent enlargement of the cardiac silhouette in this patient 
who has undergone a previous coronary artery bypass graft. 
Bilateral pleural effusions are seen on the lateral view. No 
evidence of acute pneumonia or definite pulmonary vascular 
congestion. 

TTE:
The left atrium is moderately dilated. There is mild symmetric 
left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and 
regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular 
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The ascending 
aorta is mildly dilated. There are three calcified aortic valve 
leaflets. There is severe aortic valve stenosis (area 0.7 cm2). 
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets 
are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. No mass 
or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve. Mild (1+) mitral 
regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly 
thickened. The supporting structures of the tricuspid valve are 
thickened/fibrotic. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic 
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion. 

IMPRESSION: No evidence of endocarditi. Mild symmetric left 
ventricular hypertrophy with preserved global and regional 
biventricular systolic function. Severe calcific aortic 
stenosis. Mild pulmonary hypertension.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of ___, 
biventricular function has normalized, and severity of mitral 
and tricuspid regurgitation has diminished. The other findings, 
including severity of aortic stenosis, are similar.  

ECG:
Sinus rhythm with 1st degree A-V block 
Right bundle branch block 
Nonspecific diffuse T wave flattening 
Since previous tracing of ___, T wave flattening noted 
  

MRI ___:
IMPRESSION:
1. Signal abnormalities at C3-4 disc are suspicious for early 
changes of discitis. No epidural abscess or epidural phlegmon 
identified. No prevertebral or paravertebral abscess seen.
2. Mild multilevel degenerative changes. No evidence of spinal 
cord compression.
3. Heterogenous thyroid gland with enlargement as described 
above.

 
Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ is a ___ yo M with a PMH of severe aortic stenosis, 
DM2, anemia who presented from home with positive blood 
cultures. Hospital course is as described below:

# Positive blood cultures: The patient was noted to have fever 
during his previous admission but was discharged after cultures 
remained negative for 48 hours. He was called back in on ___ 
after his blood cultures from ___ grew streptococcus 
viridans, ___ bottles. His repeat blood cultures drawn on ___ 
before antibiotics also came back with ___ bottles positive for 
strep. viridans. He was started on vancomycin presumptively and 
was continued on it given his penicillin allergy (severe leg 
swelling). The source of the strep. viridans is unclear at this 
point. In discussion with the blood bank, it appears that his 
fevers began prior to his transfusions on his previous 
admission, making an infected blood product very unlikely. A TTE 
showed no evidence of vegetations. In discussion with his 
cardiologist, Dr. ___, it was felt that a TEE would 
add little data given his already markedly abnormal valves. 
Given our high suspicion for endocarditis and the species of 
bacteria, it was decided to treat presumptively for native valve 
endocarditis.  A PICC was placed after his subsequent cultures 
had been negative for greater 72hrs. He will continue on his 
vancomycin for a total of a 6 week course. He had some low grade 
fevers initially during his admission but had been afebrile for 
48 hours prior to discharge. He was evaluated by ___ and OT and 
and they recommended a short stay at a rehab facility given his 
deconditioning.

# Neck pain/discitis: The patient described approximate one 
month of subacute neck pain that he states was helped by 
physical therapy. Out of concern for osteomyelitis or spinal 
epidural abscess given his concurrent endocarditis, he received 
and MRI of his cervical spine which showed early discitis at 
C3-4. This necessitated a 6 week course of antibiotics as above. 
He was continued on a soft cervical collar and tylenol for pain 
control. 

# Transfusion-dependent anemia: Unclear source. ___, EGD, small 
 
bowel enteroscopy did not find bleed in past. His hematocrit 
remained stable during this admission. He was continued on his 
TID iron. 
.  
# CAD: He was continued on his home ASA, Isordil, ACEI, statin, 
and no BB was used secondary to bradycardia in past.  
.  
# Hypertension: Continued on his home dose Lasix, Isordil, 
lisinopril, and prazosin.  
.  
# Hypercholesterolemia: Continued on his home dose statin  
.  
# Aortic stenosis: Severe aortic stenosis. But remained 
euvolemic and asymptomatic. Needs AVR per Dr. ___ 
the patient has repeatedly refused.  
.  
# Chronic Systolic Heart Failure with EF50%: Continued on home 
dose Lasix and ACEI, no beta blocker because of bradycarida.  No 
signs of volume overload during this admission. 
.  
# DM2: Held glyburide while in house and treated with RISS. 
Restarted glyburide on discharge.  
.  
#) FEN - diabetic, cardiac low salt dietdiet  
#) PPx - heparin subcutaneously for DVT ppx. PPI per home 
regimen. Bowel regimen  
#) Code - FULL  
#) Dispo- to rehab given deconditioning with lengthy hospital 
stay.

Sinus rhythm with ventricular premature depolarizations. First 
degree  
atrio-ventricular conduction delay. Right bundle-branch block. 
Cannot 
exclude prior infero-posterior myocardial infarction. Compared 
to the previous 
tracing of ___ no major change. 

CHEST (PA & LAT)  ___ 2:33 ___
Over a period of ___ years, there is definite increase in heart 
size which is mildly enlarged. There is pulmonary vascular 
engorgement with early interstitial thickening seen in both 
lungs. In addition there is a newly occurring small right 
pleural effusion and a smaller if present left pleural effusion. 
Patient is status post CABG with multiple sternotomy wires and 
surgical clips.
IMPRESSION:
1. The consolation of findings including increase in heart size, 
pulmonary vascular engorgement, early interstitial edema and 
bilateral pleural effusion it favors congestive heart failure. 
However, any early pneumonic infiltration cannot be completely 
excluded.
 
TTE (Complete) Done ___ at 4:43:49 ___      
The left atrium is moderately dilated. There is mild symmetric 
left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size 
is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is low 
normal (LVEF 50%). [Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function 
is likely more depressed given the severity of valvular 
regurgitation.] Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased 
left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). There is no 
ventricular septal defect. The right ventricular cavity is 
dilated with borderline normal free wall function. [Intrinsic 
right ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed 
given the severity of tricuspid regurgitation.] There are focal 
calcifications in the aortic arch. The aortic valve leaflets are 
severely thickened/deformed. There is severe aortic valve 
stenosis). Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral 
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve 
prolapse. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to 
acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation may be 
significantly UNDERestimated.] The tricuspid valve leaflets are 
mildly thickened. The supporting structures of the tricuspid 
valve are thickened/fibrotic. Moderate [2+] tricuspid 
regurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic 
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion. 

Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed) 
of ___, left and right ventricular contractile 
function are both reduced.
