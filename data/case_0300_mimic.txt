imaging studies:

EEG
IMPRESSION: This is a normal video-EEG monitoring session. There 
were 
several pushbutton entries capturing a prolonged event that was 
typical 
for his episodes. During the event EEG background activity was 
normal; 
however, the patient appeared anxious and had tachycardia as 
well as 
chest pain, dizziness, hyperventilation, and lip tremor. During 
the 
episode he was mostly quiet but was able to answer the questions 

appropriately and obey command. This event was most consistent 
with a 
panic attack. There were no epileptiform discharges or 
electrographic 
seizures. 

Ct HEAD
IMPRESSION: 1.3 cm left frontal lobe cavernoma, unchanged since 
___. No new hemorrhage, edema, or mass effect. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ was admitted to ___.

His AED- Keppra, was decreased and then discontinued completely. 


on ___ he had a 10minute event with sinus tachycardia into 
the 140s, profuse sweating, agitation and chest pain. He was 
given 1mg Ativan, and this episode promptly resolved. however, 
there was no electrographic evidence of seizure during this 
episode.

Given that this was a typical episode for his frequent 
outpatient events, it was determined that he was likely 
suffering from panic attacks rather than seizures. 

His keppra was restarted at his original dose and he was 
discharged home.

He will have a follow up with the Comprehensive epilepsy group.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,
You were admitted to ___ on 
___ due to seizures. You were found to have a 
cavernoma and were followed by neurosurgery. This does not 
require any intervention at this time. On the neurology service 
you were monitored for any ongoing seizure activity and 
anti-epileptic medications were adjusted. 
 
We made the following changes to your medications:
Started Keppra 1000mg twice daily
You need one more dose of Azithromycin 250mg tomorrow to 
complete your course of antibiotics

If you experience any of the below listed danger signs, please 
call your doctor or go to the nearest Emergency Department.
 
It was a pleasure taking care of you during your hospital stay.

•Take your pain medicine as prescribed if needed. You do not 
need to take it if you do not have pain.
•Exercise should be limited to walking; no lifting, straining, 
or excessive bending.
•Increase your intake of fluids and fiber, as narcotic pain 
medicine can cause constipation. We generally recommend taking 
an over the counter stool softener, such as Docusate (Colace) 
while taking narcotic pain medication.
•DO not take any anti-inflammatory medicines such as Motrin, 
Aspirin, Advil, or Ibuprofen etc. until follow up.

•***You have been prescribed Keppra (levetiracetam),
CALL YOUR SURGEON IMMEDIATELY IF YOU EXPERIENCE ANY OF THE 
FOLLOWING

•New onset of tremors or seizures.
•Any confusion, lethargy or change in mental status.

•Pain or headache that is continually increasing, or not 
relieved by pain medication.
