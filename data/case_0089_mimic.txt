the time of discharge, his diarrhea was much improved, and he 
was tolerating oral hydration and nutrition. He was discharged 
with a total 10 day course of flagyl until ___.
 
# Neutropenia: He was found to be neutropenic with ANC 250 at 
nadir. This was likely secondary to chemotherapy with taxotere, 
as well as response to C. diff infection. He did not have fever. 
Given neutropenia and concern for intra-abdominal process, he 
received IV cefepime for 3 days until he was no longer 
neutropenic. His ANC improved and was 1,125 at the time of 
discharge.
  
# Anemia: Hct drop on admission concerning for GIB, stools 
mildly positive without frank blood or melena. Likely secondary 
to chemotherapy and anemia of chronic disease. His hematocrit 
remained stable and he did not require transfusions. His Hct at 
discharge was 36.1.

definitively with radiation, and restarted therapy with lupron 
in ___. He started taxotere 60mg/m2 on ___, and is 
currently on ___ cycle ___ = C3D9) - receives taxotere every 3 
weeks, last dose was on ___ (cycle 3). He is responding with 
decreased PSA and improvement in pain. Notably, he was admitted 
___ to ___ for right pleuritic CP, PE workup negative, 
however CT showed possible lung metastases. His PSA was 559 on 
this admission, improved from 668 one week prior, and 964 in 
___. 
 
# Hypertension: His blood pressure was elevated to SBP 150s-160s 
after he was adequately resuscitated. He was continued on his 
home valsartan, and further adjustments should be made on an 
outpatient basis.

flagyl, and his diarrhea improved. He should continued to take 
flagyl to complete a 10 day course until ___. Please follow 
up to ensure that his c. diff has been adquately treated.
 
# He was found to be neutropenic during this admission, most 
likely a result of his taxotere as well as infection. His ANC 
improved with treatment of his infection, and he was no longer 
neutropenic by the time of discharge. Please check his CBC w/ 
diff at the next follow up, and adjust his medications as 
appropriate.
 
# A chest film showed a 13-mm nodule projecting over the left 
lung base. A CT chest performed in ___ showed multiple 
bilateral lung nodules concerning for metastatic disease. Please 
follow up on his chest imaging, and consider repeat CT to 
evaluate for progression of his prostate cancer. His PSA on this 
admission was 559, which is improved compared to prior.
 
# His blood pressure was elevated during this admission to SBP 
150-160s despite his home valsartan 160mg daily. Please check

___ CHEST (PA & LAT): Heart size and mediastinum are stable 
in appearance.  Bilateral pleural effusions and bibasal 
atelectasis appear to be slightly more pronounced than on the 
prior study.  There is no evidence of pulmonary edema or 
pneumothorax. 
___ CHEST (PORTABLE AP): As compared to the previous 
radiograph, there is a minimal increase in visibility of the 
interstitial lung structures, likely reflecting increased 
interstitial fluid load.  The pleural effusions and the 
bilateral areas of atelectasis are unchanged in extent and 
severity.  No new parenchymal opacity suggesting pneumonia.  
Normal size of the cardiac silhouette.  No pneumothorax.

ferritin. In conversation with his other providers, it was 
decided not to intervene acutely. 

#Anorexia: Possibly secondary to underlying malignancy, recent 
infections. Mirtazipine was initiated and he will see palliative 
care as an outpatient for symptom management. 

# DM- Diet controlled
 
# Back pain- continue PRN oxycodone and Tylenol

# Constipation- bowel regimen with miralax, colace, senna  

# HTN - valsartan decreased to 80mg and switched to nights to

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
foley catheter placement ___

 
History of Present Illness:
This is an ___ with a history of prostate cancer that has 
advanced despite antiandrogen therapy who is admitted with 
anuria over the past three days.  He has complained of decreased 
urinary stream strength, urinary dribbling, and spraying over 
the past three weeks, noting tht it takes much longer to empty 
his bladder and as a consequence he often has incomplete 
emptying and episodes of incontinence.  He did not pass any 
urine for the past three days and cannot recall any episodes of 
incontinence.  He has chronic pain of the lower back and legs, 
which he also feels advanced over the past three days.  He saw 
his cardiologist yesterday in followup of a recent admission to 
the ___ with CHF, and he was referred to the ED for management of 
this anuria.

In the ED, a foley catheter was placed however there was no 
written or verbal signout of the amount of urine passed.  The 
patient was told that the urine was passing well, however.  
There was conern for cord compression given the back pain and 
retention though he has previous hardware that apparently 
limited MRI and his cr elevation to 3.1 precluded contrast MRI.  
Neuro saw him and was reassured by the clinincal exam.  Due to 
his history of spine mets, a CT spine was obtained revealing no 
new compression fractures and he was admitted to medicine.

This morning, the pain is slight.  He thinks there was relief 
following foley placement.  No flank pain.  No fever or chills.  
No abdominal pain.  Complaining of some nausea without vomiting. 
feels very dry.  Coughing scant phlegm.  No weakness of the 
lwoer extremities, sensory changes in the pelvic saddle 
distribution or lower leg.

Imaging:
CXR ___:  Minimally increased opacification of retrocardiac 
space may represent atelectasis, but cannot exclude developing 
pneumonia in the appropriate clinical setting. No overt 
pulmonary edema.

CT T/L SPINE ___:
No vertebral compression fracture identified. Diffuse 
osteoblastic lesions throughout the thoracic spine, the largest 
noted in T8, T10 and T11. Background degenerative changes are 
identified with anterior osteophyte formation. Atherosclerotic 
calcifications noted throughout the thoracic aorta. Bilateral 
small nonhemorrhagic pleural effusions are identified. Lungs are 
incompletely assessed with ground-glass opacification noted in 
the dependent portions, possibly representing atelectasis versus 
mild background pulmonary edema. IMPRESSION: No compression 
fracture. Diffuse osteoblastic metastases.

GU ULTRASOUND ___:
The right kidney measures 9.3 cm and the left kidney measures 
10.1 cm. There is no hydronephrosis. A small nonobstructing 
stone measuring 5 mm is seen at the upper pole of the right 
kidney. A second nonobstructing stone is seen at the mid/lower 
pole of the right kidney measuring 4 mm. There is no cyst or 
suspicious solid renal mass identified in either kidney. No 
perinephric fluid collection is identified. The urinary bladder 
is collapsed on a Foley catheter. IMPRESSION: Two small 
nonobstructing stones in the right kidney. No hydronephrosis.

 
Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ is a very pleasant ___ with diffusely metastatic 
prostate cancer who presented with acute urinary retention and 
post-renal ___ due to likely obstruction at the prostatic level 
relieved with foley catheterization discharged to commence 
anti-androgen therapy with abiraterone.

ACTIVE ISSUES:
1. ACUTE URINARY RETENTION/PROSTATIC OBSTRUCTION:  He presented 
with anuria for three days prior to presentation accompanied by 
severe pain of the pelvis and back that he struggled to 
differentiate from his typical metastatic bone pain. Foley was 
placed in the ED and though the output was not recorded, the 
patient says at least ___ drained with improvement of his pain. 
There was concern for cord compression in the ED given the 
retention and pain.  He was not felt to be a candidate for MRI 
due to inner ear stapes inplants.  Neuro consulted and felt the 
clinical history was not consistent with compression.  He 
underwent CT of the spine that did not show new fractures.  GU 
ultrasound did not show hydronephrosis or upper tract 
obstruction.  Prostate exam revealed a large and nodule prostate 
without fecal impaction.  Following discussions with his primary 
oncology team, it was decided to discharge with a foley and 
begin a new anti-androgen abiraterone along with prednisone with 
a void trial with urology in a few weeks.  If that fails, he may 
be a candidate for TURP as an outpatient.  He pulled his foley 
out by accident on ___, which was replaced successfully 
afterwards.

2. CASTRATE-RESISTANT METASTATIC PROSTATE CANCER: He has diffuse 
___ metastases and chronic pain from prostate cancer that has 
progressed through leupron, ketaconazole treatment.  PSA 
recently ascended from normal range to 300.  He acquired new 
anti-androgen drug abiraterone from the ___ one day prior to 
admission. He will commence this treatment at home with 
prednisone 5mg daily and will followup with his oncology team, 
Drs. ___.

3. ACUTE KIDNEY INJURY: Post renal in nature due to obstruction 
due to improvement following foley placement.  Cr ascended to 
3.1 from 1.5.  No hydronephrosis on ultrasound following 
decompression.  His ___ and lasix were held and Cr steadily 
downtrended to 1.5.

INACTIVE ISSUES
1. DIASTOLIC HEART FAILURE: Chronic without exacerbation. 
Recently exacerbated at the ___ requiring a 3 day hospitalization 
and IV diuresis one week prior to admission.  He was mildly 
fluid overloaded peripherally without pulmonary edema.  His 
lasix was held due to renal injury.

2. HYPERTENSION: Held his ___ but continued terazosin and 
amlodipine.

PENDING TESTS AT DISCHARGE: none

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
1. void trial in ___ weeks with urology, consideration of TURP 
if obstruction persists
2. monitoring of PSA and response to abiraterone
3. Holding lasix, ___, and statin. Can be restarted as 
outpatient if Cr and CK are stable.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,

You were admitted to the hospital because you could not urinate. 
 We did numerous tests on you blood and took images of your body 
that suggested that your advancing prostate cancer probably 
obstructed the flow of urine out of your bladder.  This 
obstruction also damaged your kidneys, but we suspect they will 
improve, as they have continued to do so every day since you 
were admitted.  We relieved this problem with a foley catheter 
which you will continue to use as an outpatient as we wait for 
your new medicine to start working. It will be important to 
followup with your urology, PCP, and oncology teams to be sure 
you continue to improve.

The following changes were made to your medications:
1. STOP LASIX, VALSARTAN until your PCP tells you to restart 
because they may interfere with your kidney's recovery
2. START Abiraterone to help treat your prostate cancer
3. STOP HYDROCORTISONE, it will be replaced by PREDNISONE 5mg 
daily
4. STOP ROSUVASTATIN FOR NOW until some of your blood tests 
normalize
5. STOP HYDROCORTISONE AND KETOCONAZOLE since they were not 
effective at stopping your cancer

Please continue all other medictions as previously prescribed.

It was a pleasure working with you, Mr. ___
