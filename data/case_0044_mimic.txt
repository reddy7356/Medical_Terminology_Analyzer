Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the vascular surgey service on 
___. He underwent a L CEA. (Please see operative note for 
further details.) Unfortunately, the patient developed a Right 
sided stroke after the procedure. A CT perfusion scan was 
performed that showed complete infarction in the territory of 
the L ACA. The patient was unable to move his right side upon 
leaving the operating room. Throughout his hospital stay, the 
patient was unable to speak or move his right side. He would 
intermittently follow commands using his Left side. He could 
understand what was being told to him, but could not respond. On 
POD2, patient began to have RUE convulsions. Neurology was 
consulted and determined that these were focal partial seizures. 
The patient was started on keppra, and these symptoms resolved 
the next day. The patient was started on TPN for nutrition after 
he failed speech/swallow trial. A PEG tube was placed on ___ 
___. Physical therapy worked with the patient, and 
he slowly improved throughout his stay. He was making more 
audible sounds, and was following commands better. He was still 
unable to speak or move the right side. Tube feeds were started 
prior to discharge. Throughout his stay, the patient remained 
hemodynamically stable. His blood sugars were elevated upon 
starting TPN. Due to his inability to take po, the patient's 
oral hypoglycemics could not be administered. ___ was 
consulted and developed an insulin regimen that were able to 
keep the patient's blood sugars under good control. Once the PEG 
was placed, patient was restarted on po meds and was also 
started on tube feeds. Patient will be discharged to rehab until 
his neurologic status improves.
