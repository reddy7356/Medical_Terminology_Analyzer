Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,

It was a pleasure caring for you at ___. You were admitted 
with abdominal ___ and headaches. We feel that your abdominal 
___ is related to constipation and H. pylori. Your headaches 
were most likely related to stress and strain from the abdominal 
___. Both are now improved. We have started you on several 
medications to help with constipation and headache, and have 
started the H. pylori treatment course from the beginning. This 
will require an additional 2 weeks of antibiotics.

It is important to stay well-hydrated to prevent worsening 
constipation.

Please followup with gastroenterology and your primary care 
doctor as an outpatient.

Best wishes,

Your ___ Team
