ideations through active starvation, admitted under ___ 
for the eating disorder protocol. He is medically cleared for 
transfer to inpatient psychiatry.

#Malnourishment: Patient states that he has not been eating for 
the past 6 weeks with the intent of starving himself. He has 
experienced multiple falls per day and has had at least a 15 
pound weight loss over the past six weeks. He was admitted for 
the eating disorder protocol and was monitored for risk of 
refeeding syndrome. Electrolytes required intermittent repletion 
with Neutra-Phos packets. After a multidisciplinary meeting 
between nutrition, social work, psychiatry, and the primary 
team, the protocol was discontinued with the condition being 
that he eat three meals each day. He gained weight each day of 
his stay. Weight on admission: 65 kg. Weight on discharge: 70 
kg.

Dear Mr. ___,

You were hospitalized at ___ after you endorsed suicidal 
thoughts by active starvation. You were placed on an eating 
protocol to improve your nutritional supplementation. Your

Pertinent Results:
Please refer for OMR for pertinent imaging and lab results. 
 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ is a ___ year old incarcerated male, who 
presented to ___ s/p fall with right frontal SDH. 

#Right Frontal SDH
Patient presents on ___ with CT from OSH demonstrating right 
frontal SDH. Patient was admitted to neurosurgery service for 
further workup and evaluation. A repeat NCHCT was obtained the 
next morning, which was stable, with no new areas of hemorrhage. 
Aspirin and Coumadin were held from the time of admission. 
Neurological exam remained stable throughout his admission. The 
patient was noted to be lethargic on examination on ___. In the 
setting of lethargy, a non-contrast head CT was ordered which 
showed a stable right frontal subdural hematoma. 

#A.___
Patient has a history of A.fibb medically managed with aspirin 
and Coumadin. Patient's INR was reversed at OSH, and patient 
received platelets here at ___. Aspirin and Coumadin were 
held, and it was determined to continue to hold anticoagulation 
until follow up appointment, where patient will need to be 
cleared by neurosurgery prior to restarting. Given underlying 
A.fib, there is a risk of stroke without any anticoagulation, 
but in the setting of patient's acute subdural hematoma, the 
risk of re-hemorrhage on these medications is higher. 

#Urinary Retention 
Patient experienced new onset urinary retention during his 
admission. He was intermittently straight cathed. Urinalysis and 
urine cultures were sent which were negative for infection. He 
continued to retain urine overnight on ___ and a foley catheter 
was placed. On ___, the patient's foley catheter was 
discontinued for a voiding trial. Patient was unable to void, 
and a foley was replaced. Patient was cleared to be discharged 
with foley catheter and close follow up with urology as an 
outpatient. 

#Psychiatric illness
While inpatient, there was a concern for patient having an 
underlying eating disorder, as he had minimal PO intake and 
reports recent weight loss. A Psych consult was placed where it 
was determined that since the patient is medically stable, this 
can be further managed as an outpatient. 

Patient expressed to the team that he is extremely depressed and 
"does not want to live anymore". Psych was again consulted, and 
given that the patient is already under 24 hour supervision 
(___ officers), has his ankles handcuffed to the bed, 
and is not explicitly expressing a suicidal plan, it was 
determined that he is not at an immediate risk of harming 
himself or others. It was recommended that patient follow up 
with outpatient psych for further management.  

#Bilateral Lower Extremity Weakness
On ___, the patient was noted to have new bilateral lower 
extremity weakness. In the setting of urinary retention, a MRI 
of the cervical, thoracic and lumbar spine which was negative 
for hematoma or canal stenosis. He continued with bilateral 
lower extremity weakness through.....

#Electrolyte Abnormalities
The patient's phosphorous and calcium levels were low during 
this hospitalization and it was repleted. 

#Constipation
The patient received Mag Citrate on ___ for constipation. 

#Dispo Planning
Given that patient had a fall of unknown cause which led to his 
SDH, it was determined he would benefit from ___ consults. 
___ recommended ...

mixed iron-deficiency anemia & anemia of chronic disease. He 
underwent EGD, which showed no abnormality. H/H stabilized 
without intervention. 

# WEIGHT LOSS: For his rapid weight loss, Psychiatry was 
consulted due to concern that patient could be intentionally 
trying to lose weight by not eating. MRI brain showed stable 
SDH, but no acute changes and no sarcoid in the brain; and EGD 
showed no structural lesion that would cause weight loss. He was 
given thiamine, folate, and multivitamins, and was encouraged to 
eat three daily meals with supplements. 

# FEVER: Flu B positive at outside hospital, per report, but he 
was outside of the window for Tamiflu, so he received supportive 
care. Urine culture showed Enterococcal UTI, so he was treated 
with 7-day course of Macrobid. Fever resolved prior to discharge 
and he remained hemodynamically stable. 

# ENCEPHALOPATHY: Patient had no focal neurologic deficits, and 
SDH was stable on imaging. He had no exam findings to suggest 
___, and was given thiamine replacement. MRI without 
acute findings, and patient was at his baseline mental status at 
time of discharge. 

# AFIB: Patient in normal sinus here. Per ___ clinic 
note, it would be okay to restart patient's anticoagulation. 
This was held prior to EGD, and should be restarted at 
discharge. 

# URINARY RETENTION: Foley was initially in place for urinary 
retention, and patient was started on Flomax qhs. Urinary 
retention improved, and foley was discontinued on ___. He 
urinated well from ___, but retained on ___ in the 
afternoon, so was straight cath'd x1 prior to discharge 

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
[ ] Please encourage patient to eat 3 meals daily. Closely 
monitor his weight and PO intake
[ ] Continue 7-day course of Macrobid (___) for UTI
[ ] Please restart Warfarin at the dose he was stable on 
previously. Closely monitor INR while on blood thinner

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr ___,

It was a pleasure taking care of you. You were admitted to ___ 
___ because you had a fever in prison. 
While you were here, you received antibiotics for a urinary 
infection, and you were treated supportively for the flu.

Your blood counts were a little low, so we got an endoscopy to 
look for possible bleeding in your GI tract. This was normal. 

We also got an MRI of your brain, which showed a stable bleed in 
your brain, and no other disease. 

When you go back to prison, please take all of your medicines as 
prescribed. Alert your doctor if you have any fevers, chills, 
bleeding, or other symptoms that are concerning to you. We 
encourage you to eat three meals daily. 

We wish you all the best in the future.

Sincerely,
Your ___ Care Team

Chief Complaint:
persistent AMS after seizure
 
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None
 
History of Present Illness:
Dr. ___ with a diagnosis of sarcoidosis who presents with
persistent lethargy and decreased responsiveness after a
first-time seizure.

The history is provided by his wife.

He got dressed for a doctor's appointment this morning, and was
at his baseline. Then he started vomiting. When wife asked if he
was ok, he didn't respond, with closed eyes and mumbling but no
LOC, so she called ___. They arrived in 15 minutes. Both legs
were shaking slightly (adductor movements) during this time.

Of note, the wife says that she was going to request inpatient
psychiatric evaluation today at the doctor's office because she
is concerned about her husband's level of depression.

At ___, he had a 1 minute tonic clonic seizure, received
Ativan 2 mg and 2gm magnesium (level low on labs). He was
post-ictal initially but did not return to baseline. Stox and
utox neg, CBC at baseline pancytopenia, other labs wnl except
lactate 2.7. CT head negative. Neurology was consulted, but for
persistent AMS, patient transferred to ___ for further care.

In ED, per ED resident: patient follows commands intermittently,
but is not back to his baseline.

Per wife:
He is usually drowsy, lethargic and tired but usually answers 
his
wife and is able to talk normally. He has been admitted for 
these
symptoms in the past but workup was inconclusive. He has never
had a seizure.

He had vomiting from gastroparesis ___ year ago. This usually
occurs after eating. He usually maintains normal consciousness
during vomiting.

This past summer he had multiorgan failure from Tylenol 
overdose.
This was accidental.

The patient has tingling in his hands and feet chronically.

He has constipation, treated with stool softener and miralax.

Baseline: walks with walker.

Wife ___: phone number ___

Per chart review and prior workup:

The patient was recently admitted at the beginning of ___
for lymph node biopsy of mediastinal lymphadenopathy, to rule 
out
lymphoma. Pathology results are consistent with sarcoidosis and
do not show evidence of malignancy.

Prior EMG performed for complaints of weakness after Tylenol
overdose showed evidence of a mild generalized myopathy without
denervating features and generalized sensory motor 
polyneuropathy
with axonal features, felt consistent with prior steroid use
rather than sarcoid myopathy. EMG from ___ showed evidence
for a very mild length dependent sensory polyneuropathy. There 
is
no definite electrophysiologic evidence for a generalized
myopathy, though the mild myopathic findings in the right 
deltoid
may indicate a mild, proximal myopathic process. Incidental note
of a mild chronic ulnar neuropathy at the right elbow.

Hematology workup has showed normocytic normochromic anemia.
Although chart review stated that the patient has pernicious
anemia, B12 deficiency, and iron deficiency anemia, this is not
borne out by recent labs and the patient is not on supplements.
Colonoscopy was normal.
  
ROS unable to obtain.

are 
relatively unchanged in  comparison to ___ given 
differences and measuring technique.  Findings could be related 
to patient's history of sarcoidosis.  Recommend close attention 
to these nodes on follow-up imaging. 
 
Brief Hospital Course:
Dr. ___ is a ___ year man with sarcoidosis, severe 
depression, intermittent visual hallucination who is admitted to 
the neurology service for increased lethargy and a reported 
episode of convulsion concerning for possible seizure.  He was 
admitted for work up of first time seizure.  The primary concern 
was neuro-sarcoidosis given his recent diagnosis of 
sarcoidosis(from lymph node biopsy ___.  Lumbar puncture was 
performed on ___, showing 3wbc, 1rbc, normal protein and 
glucose, making active neurosarcoidosis and CNS 
infection/inflammatory conditions highly unlikely.  He had a 
routine EEG performed (while he was having visual 
hallucinations) and there was no epileptiform discharges.  There 
is frequent drowsiness on the EEG record but his waking 
background is largely normal.  His ankle tracking device was 
removed (with the authorization of the Sheriff's office) for MRI 
brain, which shows some non-specific chronic white matter 
changes but no acute structural finding that would explain his 
current mental status.  He was initially placed on acyclovir but 
that was discontinued due to low clinical suspicion for HSV 
encephalitis.  He remained clinically stable, afebrile and 
without leukocytosis off the acyclovir.  Tox screen (serum and 
urine) were negative.  

In terms of infectious workup, his UA is negative for UTI.  CXR 
negative.  He has serous discharge from his biopsy site on his 
back.  Thoracic team evaluated his wound and thought that it 
looks like a seroma but recommend culture and empiric PO Keflex 
x 7 days, which he completed.

The etiology of his convulsive event is unclear.  Based on the 
description of the witnessed event at OSH, it seems probable 
that it was a seizure.  He is started on levetiracetam 1000mg 
bid and should remain on it for seizure prophylaxis.  There is 
no identifiable trigger to this seizure event.  Given his 
psychiatric history, levetiracetam may not be the best long term 
anti-seizure medication for him as it can cause mood problems in 
some patients.  If that is the case, it may be reasonable to 
consider other options lamotrigine though uptitration can take a 
long time and hence not the best acute option.

He also has poor nutritional status (B12 267, Vit D 5) and is 
supplemented with B12, Vitamin D and thiamine.

Psychiatry team is consulted as his clinical picture is most 
consistent with a decompensated psychiatric disorder.  
Psychiatry feels that his presentation is most c/w depression 
and cognitive decline.  Recommended psych inpatient 
hospitalization (patient agreeable), and sleep study.

Transitional Issues:
[ ] outpatient sleep study (can be arranged through PCP after 
all his acute issues stabilize)
[ ] outpatient neuro-psychiatric testing

Brief Hospital Course:
Dr. ___ is a ___ gentleman with PMH significant for 
extrapulmonary sarcoidosis not on steroids at the time of 
admission, steroid induced DM, and depression who was 
transferred from ___ ___ the setting of fulminant hepatic 
failure secondary to Tylenol ingestion (possibly intentional, 
although patient denies this and psychiatry feels that there is 
no indication that this was an intentional overdose).  He was 
intubated and received N-acetylcysteine and ongoing supportive 
care ___ the ICU for his liver failure, ultimately with 
improvement and no indication for liver transplant.  His course 
___ the ICU was notable for hypotension managed with albumin and 
pressors (appropriate response on ACTH stimulation test); 
treatment of pneumonia with vancomycin/zosyn/fluconazole 
(narrowed to cefepime on the basis of culture results); hepatic 
encephalopathy; and thrombocytopenia (thought to be secondary to 
medications, specifically Zosyn and famotodine, which were 
discontinued).  

After extubation and as his LFTs downtrended, he was transferred 
to the medicine service, where his LFTs continued to improve 
(with the exception of an uptrending bilirubin level).  He was 
noted to be profoundly weak, even relative to his baseline.  He 
was also noted to have nausea and vomiting.  His work-up and 
treatment for these problems is outlined below:
 
ACTIVE ISSUES
==============

# FULMINANT HEPATIC FAILURE: 
While most of his LFTs continued to normalize after his transfer 
out of the ICU, he had a rising predominantly direct 
hyperbilirubinemia without associated elevation ___ alkaline 
phosphatase.  A RUQ ultrasound was obtained and showed no 
evidence of biliary obstruction, but did reveal mild to moderate 
ascites, bilateral pleural effusions, and splenomegaly.  A 
diagnostic paracentesis was performed, and analysis of ascitic 
fluid initially seemed to be consistent with CHF (elevated SAAG 
with high total protein).  However, a cardiac echo on ___ 
showed no evidence of systolic or diastolic dysfunction.  Given 
this, cirrhosis seemed more likely as the cause of his ascites.  
He was started on Lasix for ascites, but this was discontinued 
due to orthostasis.  He also had intermittent somnolence and 
confusion, consistent with hepatic encephalopathy, which 
improved with lactulose.  
 
We then performed a transjugular biopsy of his liver during 
which we recorded intravascular pressures consistent with portal 
hypertension (hepatic venous pressure gradiet = 10 mmHg).  
Pathology results showed acute toxic injury without histologic 
evidence of chronic liver injury. His bilirubin remained 
persistently elevated and we performed an MRCP, which showed no 
evidence of biliary obstruction but did reveal abnormal 
enhancement ___ the liver and spleen, suggestive of hepatosplenic 
sarcoidosis (although note that directed biopsy of liver lesions 
was not performed to confirm this diagnosis). 

His bilirubin was still elevated at time of discharge (though 
downtrending), despite treatment with ursodiol; we believe that 
this is secondary to resolving acetaminophen toxicity.

Overall, Dr. ___ is consistent acute liver 
injury due to acetaminophen intoxication. We cannot rule out 
underlying hepatic sarcoidosis. He will need to follow up with a 
hepatologist for long-term evaluation and treatment of his liver 
dysfunction.  He will also need an outpatient EGD to screen for 
varices.

# GASTROPARESIS:
Early ___ his hospsital course, he vomited his undigested 
breakfast at 5pm, suggestive of gastroparesis. This occurred 
several times, despite treatment with Zofran. To evaluate for 
gastroparesis, we performed a gastric emptying study (4 days 
after discontinuation of Reglan, to ensure that this would not 
interfere with the study). He was not on opioids at the time of 
gastric emptying study. The gastric emptying study showed 23% of 
ingested activity remaining ___ the stomach at 4 hours (normal: 
less than or equal to 10%).  He was started on standing PO 
Reglan with meals and was able to tolerate full meals without 
nausea or vomiting.  He was encouraged to eat small, frequent 
meals.

# WEIGHT LOSS:
His recorded weight ___ the ICU on ___, after receiving IVF 
and blood products, was 60.6 kg. On transfer to the medicine 
floor on ___ (at which point he was fluid overloaded, 
estimated at a total of +9L following ICU stay), his weight was 
67.3 kg (BMI of 23.3).  He initially self-diuresed 1.5-2 L a day 
until reaching ~58 kg, and subsequently lost about 5 kg during 
his final 1.5 weeks of hospitalization.  His weight on discharge 
was 53.3 kg (BMI 18.4).  Note that he was eating full meals for 
approximately one week prior to discharge; prior to this his PO 
intake was limited ___ gastroparesis (see above).  He was seen 
by nutrition who recommended an intake of 1872 kcal and 94g 
protein/day. Please ensure that he meets these nutrition 
requirements on discharge. If his BMI drops below 18.0 (52 kg), 
please consider hospitalization for NGT placement and tube feed 
initiation. 

The etiology of his weight loss remains unclear at this time, 
but is assumed to be related to poor PO intake. If he continues 
to lose weight despite continued adequate PO intake please 
consider further workup for other etiologies of weight loss. 
Ensure that he is up-to-date on all cancer screening.

# WEAKNESS:
Likely multifactorial, acutely due to ICU myopathy with 
underlying chronic contribution from other myopathy (e.g. 
steroid myopathy, sarcoid myopathy), poor nutrition, and/or 
neuromuscular disorder.  Depression could be contributing but is 
unlikely to be the sole etiology. Unlikely to be myositis given 
normal CK (21). Maximal inspiratory pressure was normal (MIP of 
-60 on ___. EMG and nerve conduction studies were 
performed, and showed electrophysiologic evidence for a mild, 
generalized myopathy, without denervating ("inflammatory") 
features, as well as evidence for an underlying, chronic, 
generalized sensorimotor polyneuropathy with predominantly 
axonal features. He will need to be seen ___ follow up by a 
neuromuscular specialist to review the results of this EMG and 
determine an appropriate plan for further evaluation and 
treatment. 

# DEPRESSION:
Psychiatry was consulted and they felt that he is not actively 
suicidal and not at risk of self-harm.  They recommended 
restarting mirtazepine 15 mg po qhs on an outpatient basis under 
the care of an outpatient psychiatrist after complete resolution 
of liver failure.  He may schedule an appointment with ___ 
Psychiatry if he has difficulty arranging an outpatient 
psychiatry follow-up.

INACTIVE ISSUES
================
# SARCOIDOSIS: 
Presented primarily with weakness.  Lymph node biopsy at ___ ___ 
___ reportedly showed noncaseating granulomas consistent with 
sarcoidosis.  He does not recall having prior muscle biopsies.  
He will need further evaluation and treatment for his 
sarcoidosis as an outpatient; please consider referral to a 
sarcoidosis specialist.

# PAROXYSMAL ATRIAL FIBRILLATION:
Reduced metoprolol from 50 mg BID to 12.5 mg PO BID due to 
orthostatic hypotension. 

# DIABETES MELLITUS:
Blood sugars were well-controlled on a conservative insulin 
sliding scale.  He required minimal insulin during his 
hospitalization.  As an outpatient, his PCP may consider 
restarting metformin after resolution of liver failure.

# PNEUMONIA:
Patient was treated ___ the ICU for pneumonia, initially with 
vancomycin, Zosyn, and fluconazole.  His sputum grew sparse 
GNRs, so he was narrowed to cefepime.  He completed a ___CUTE KIDNEY INJURY: 
Creatinine elevated to 2.2 while ___ ICU, most likely secondary 
ATN ___ the setting of shock.  His creatinine normalized by 
discharge.

# CONCERN FOR CHF:
Question of possible CHF was raised given ascitic fluid with 
high total protein and elevated SAAG (concerning for congestive 
hepatopathy).  However, TTE on ___ showed no evidence of 
systolic or diastolic dysfunction.  Cardiology was consulted 
given concern for possible sarcoid infiltration of the heart, 
but they did not recommend further work-up at this time (such as 
a cardiac MRI).  This could be considered as an outpatient.

# ELEVATED PSA:
PSA was 22 on ___, though this could have been falsely 
elevated ___ the setting of recent Foley placement.  PSA was 
re-checked on ___ and was 4.6.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES
====================
[ ] Will need weekly labs (CBC, chem-10, LFTs, coags) while ___ 
rehab, which should be faxed to Dr. ___ (fax: 
___.

screening EGD for varices given portal hypertension
[ ] Follow-up with Hematology-Oncology (Dr. ___ 
referral prior to current admission)
[ ] Blood sugars were controlled on an insulin sliding scale, 
though his insulin requirements were minimal. Insulin was 
discontinued on discharge.  Consider re-initiation of metformin 
once liver injury resolves.
[ ] Consider cardiac MRI to evaluate for cardiac sarcoidosis.
[ ] Consider anemia workup as outpatient; anemia is chronic and 
possibly contributing to fatigue.
[ ] If patient's weight drops to <52 kg despite adequate po 
intake, consider hospitalization for NG tube placement and tube 
feeds.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Dr. ___,

___ has been a pleasure participating ___ your care at ___.  You 
were hospitalized for treatment of fulminant hepatic failure 
secondary to Tylenol intoxication.  You were initially treated 
___ the ICU, where you received N-acetylcysteine and required 
ventilation for several days.  While ___ the ICU, you were 
treated with cefepime for pneumonia.  You were transferred to 
the medicine service after your liver failure began to resolve.  


After your transfer to the medicine service, you were noted to 
be confused at times, consistent with hepatic encephalopathy.  
We treated you with lactulose, and your confusion resolved.  We 
also performed a transjugular biopsy of your liver.  While 
obtaining the biopsy, our interventional radiologists measured 
intravascular pressures consistent with portal hypertension.  
Pathology results from your biopsy showed acute inflammation ___ 
your liver with no evidence of underlying chronic liver injury.  
We performed an MRCP, which showed heterogeneity within your 
liver that could be consistent with hepatic sarcoidosis. P 
utting this information together, we believe that your liver 
failure was predominantly acute, due to tylenol ingestion, but 
we cannot rule out underlying hepatic sarcoidosis.  Please 
follow up closely with our hepatologists for further evaluation 
and treatment, and to monitor your liver function tests until 
they normalize.

You were also profoundly weak during this hospitalization.  We 
understand that your strength has been declining over the past 
several months.  To evaluate the cause of your weakness, we 
performed an EMG.  The EMG showed mild, generalized myopathy and 
an underlying, chronic, generalized sensorimotor polyneuropathy. 
 Please follow up ___ our ___ clinic for further 
evaluation, and continue to work with physical therapy to 
improve your strength.

We evaluated you for persistent nausea and vomiting. You had a 
gastric emptying study that showed moderately delayed gastric 
emptying.  This is consistent with a diagnosis of gastroparesis. 
 After this study, we re-started your treatment with Reglan at 
mealtimes, and you were able to tolerate full meals. Our 
nutrition team saw you and recommended that you eat about ___ 
kcal per day with 94g protein per day, ___ order to ensure 
adequate nutrition.Your weight on discharge was 53.3 kg. Please 
contact your physician if you continue to lose weight after 
discharge. 

Finally, you were seen by our psychiatry team.  They feel that 
you would benefit from follow-up with an outpatient psychiatrist 
to support you during this difficult time.  You can schedule an 
appointmentn with one of the psychiatrists at ___ by calling 
___.

We agree that your sarcoidosis could be contributing to some of 
the problems that you are experiencing, and that it might be 
helpful for you to see a sarcoidosis specialist.  We encourage 
you to work with your PCP to arrange this follow-up.

We wish you the best as you recover,
Your ___ care team
