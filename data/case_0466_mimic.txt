Brief Hospital Course:
___ yo woman presented with rash, fever and shortness of breath.

# Fever: Given clinical presentation of rash, general malaise, 
fevers, elevated LFTs in the setting of frequent visits to ___ 
___ patient was presumed to have Lyme disease. Lyme 
titer sent on previous admission was initially pending and 
another was redrawn. Pt was started on Doxycycline 100mg PO BID 
to treat both Lyme and/or Ehrlichiosis and had rapid improvement 
of multiple areas of rash and became afebrile. She continued to 
have generalized malaise and some "heaviness in her head". Pt's 
initial Lyme titer eventually came back negative but due to 
pretest probability being very high and pt's response, lab 
result was presumed to be false negative/too early in course of 
disease.  

Pt was also checked for Legionella urine antigen which was 
negative, and had blood cultures (no growth) and an 
echocardiogram that demonstrated no vegetations. 

Pt's LFTs, LDH and fever curve were followed closely thoughout 
the hospital course. Ms ___ was seen by the infectious 
disease team, who advised in type and length of treatment. She 
was discharged to complete a 21-day course of doxycycline.

Her LFTs were elevated at the time of admission and remained 
slightly elevated at discharge. These should be re-checked as an 
outpatient and were thought possibly due to Ehrlichiosis.

Ehrlichia and Lyme serologies were pending at the time of 
discharge.
 
# Shortness of Breath: Pt's SOB was responsive to home regimen 
with additional prn albuterol nebs and improved after initiation 
of Doxycycline.
  
# EKG changes on admission: slightly early RWP with ST 
depressions from V2 or V3 - V6. Pt received aspirin in the ED. 
She had cardiac enzymes negative x3 and a normal echocardiogram.
