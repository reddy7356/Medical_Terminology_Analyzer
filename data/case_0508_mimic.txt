Carotid Bruit :  right bruit vs murmur Left bruit vs murmur
 
Pertinent Results:
___ Echo: No spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the left 
atrial appendage. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. 
The left ventricular cavity size is top normal/borderline 
dilated. Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal. 
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). 
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. 
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with 
good leaflet excursion. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. 
The mitral valve leaflets are moderately thickened and 
myxomatous. There is flail of both anterior and posterior 
leaflets with evidence of torn chordae on both leaflets 
prolapsing into the left atrium. Severe (4+) mitral 
regurgitation is seen. There is no pericardial effusion. 
POSTBYPASS:
The patient is on infusions of epinephrine (0.02 mcg/kg/min) and 
phenylephrine (<1 mcg/kg/min). The repaired mitral valve is not 
well visualized from all angles but the leaflets are no longer 
flail and coapt better than before. There is now trace mitral 
regurgitation without evidence of mitral stenosis (gradient 3 
mmHg). Mild aortic insufficiency remains. Left ventricular 
function remains normal. Normal aortic contours.

TEE
Pre-CPB: 1 The left atrium is moderately dilated. No spontaneous 
echo contrast is seen in the body of the left atrium. The left 
atrial appendage emptying velocity is depressed (<0.2m/s). No 
thrombus is seen in the left atrial appendage. 
2. Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal. 

3. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are 
normal. 
4. The ascending, transverse and descending thoracic aorta are 
normal in diameter and free of atherosclerotic plaque. There are 
simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. 
5. There are three aortic valve leaflets. The aortic valve 
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. There is no aortic valve 
stenosis. Mild to moderate (___) aortic regurgitation is seen. 
6. A mitral valve annuloplasty ring is present. At least 2 
vegetations seen on the anterior and posterior leaflets. There 
is severe valvular mitral stenosis (area <1.0cm2). Due to 
co-existing aortic regurgitation, the pressure half-time 
estimate of mitral valve area may be an OVERestimation of true 
mitral valve area. Mitral valve area was calculated at 0.8-0.9 
cm2. There is moderate functional mitral stenosis (mean gradient 
5 mmHg) due to mitral annular calcification. Mild (1+) mitral 
regurgitation is seen. 
7. There is no pericardial effusion. 
Drs. ___ were notified in person of the 
results.
Post-CPB: On infusion of phenylephrine. AV pacing for prolonged 
PR interval. Well seated bioprothetic valve in the mitral 
postion. Small inferiolateral perivalvular leak. Small central 
leak. Peak gradient 5 mmHg, mean gradient 4 mmHg at cardiac 
output of 2.5. Preserved biventricular systolic function. AI and 
TR remain ___. Aortic contour normal post-decannulation.   
.
Radiology Report CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of ___ 9:48 
AM 
Final Report: Since the prior exam, the bilateral chest tubes 
have been removed.  There are very small bilateral apical 
pneumothoraces, slightly larger on the right than left.  The 
right pneumothorax measures approximately 12 mm and the left 
approximately 7 mm.  There is no evidence of tension.  Bibasilar 
atelectasis is unchanged.  There is no definite pleural 
effusion.  There is no pulmonary edema.  Severe cardiomegaly is 
stable.  The mediastinal contours are unchanged.  Sternal wires 
are intact.  Mediastinal clips are noted.   
IMPRESSION: 
1.  Small biapical pneumothoraces after chest tube removal. 
2.  Stable bibasilar atelectasis. 
3.  Stable severe cardiomegaly. 
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist. 
 
___. ___ 

___ CT from ___- per verbal report: no official reead at 
this time.
Right upper lobe opacity measuring 16x2cm likely hematoma but 
cannot be sure.
Substernal fluid collection measuring 6x2cm likely normal 
post-op changes
Recommend: followup CT in 6 weeks

 
Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was transferred from outside hospital after several 
TIA's. She had known mitral valve mass vs vegetation and was 
preop for redo mitral valve replacement. She brought to the 
operating room on ___ and underwent mitral valve replacement, 
please see operative report for details in summary she had: Redo 
sternotomy and redo mitral valve surgery with mitral valve 
replacement with a 25 mm ___ Bicor Epic tissue 
heart valve. Her bypass time was 80 minutes with a crossclamp 
time of 61 minutes. Overall the patient tolerated the procedure 
well and post-operatively was transferred to the CVICU intubated 
on levophed and propofol. She initally had moderate amount of 
bleeding and required products, she began to manifest tampanade 
physiology, an echo was performed which confirmed tamponade. She 
returned to the operating room for exploration and removal of 
clot and correction of coagulopathy. See operative notes for 
details. Once returning from the OR she was hemodynamically 
stable and levophed infusion was weaned. She continue to have 
moderate chest tube drainage and was given additional red blood 
cells and platelets on POD#1. Her bleeding resolved and she was 
extubated on POD#1 without difficulty.
Once extubated he was alert and oriented and breathing 
comfortably.  The patient was neurologically intact and 
hemodynamically stable on no inotropic or vasopressor support. 
Low dose Beta blocker was initiated at first due to bradycardia 
and the patient was gently diuresed toward the preoperative 
weight.  The patient was transferred to the telemetry floor for 
further recovery on POD2.  Chest tubes and pacing wires were 
discontinued per cardiac surgery protocol without complication.  
The remainder of her hospital course was uneventful, she was 
worked with nursing and physical therapy services for assistance 
with strength and mobility.  By the time of discharge on POD7 
the patient was ambulating with assistance the wound was healing 
and pain was controlled with oral analgesics.  The patient was 
discharged to ___ in ___ in good condition 
with appropriate follow up instructions. She is to follow up 
with Dr ___ in 1 month.
