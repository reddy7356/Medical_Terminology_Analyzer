no acute intracranial process.
On the floor patient says she continues to have headaches, which 
are now chronic for her. She has baseline diplopia/blurry

IMAGING
=============
RUQ Ultrasound ___ - 1. Cholelithiasis, with no evidence of 
acute cholecystitis.
2. Echogenic liver consistent with steatosis. Other forms of 
liver disease including steatohepatitis, hepatic fibrosis, or 
cirrhosis cannot be excluded on the basis of this examination.

NCHCT ___ - 1. Stable mixed solid and cystic left 
cerebellopontine angle mass, better evaluated on the prior MR, 
with mild mass effect on the left cerebellar hemisphere, pons 
and fourth ventricle. Stable configuration and size of 
ventricles.
2. No acute intracranial process
 
Brief Hospital Course:
SUMMARY: ___ h/o DMII, HTN, recently diagnosed cerebellar mass 
who presented with nausea/vomiting consistent with 
gastroenteritis. She received a CT head which did not show any 
evidence of increasing ICP from her cerebellar mass. She was 
given IV fluids, potassium repletion and Zofran with rapid 
improvement in her symptoms.

====================
ACUTE ISSUES
====================

# Nausea/vomiting: Patient presented with episodes of frequent 
vomiting as well as yellow, watery diarrhea of 4 days duration 
after tapering her prednisone. Felt to be most consistent with a 
viral gastroenteritis based on history and benign exam. There 
was initial concern for increased ICP contributing to her 
symptoms, but a NCHCT was performed which showed stable CPA mass 
and ventricle size. Neurosurgery was consulted in the ED and 
evaluated the patient.

# Cerebellar mass: Patient has a recently diagnosed L CPA mass 
with chronic symptoms of persistent headache attacks and blurred 
vision. As above, NCHCT re-demonstrated a left CPA mass stable 
from previous. She was originally supposed to have an MRI on 
___, but this was missed due to her ED admission. Her MRI 
was re-scheduled instead for ___ with plan to follow up 
with outpatient neurosurgeon Dr ___ on ___. She was 
continued on fioricet ___ tab q6h:prn for pain control and 
prednisone 1mg BID.

# ? Hepatic steatosis: RUQ ultrasound was obtained to r/o 
cholecystitis. There was no evidence of cholecystitis, but an 
echogenic liver was seen consistent with steatosis. LFTs were 
normal except for ALT 49

==================
CHRONIC ISSUES
==================
# Depression: Continued home citalopram.
# Anxiety: Continued home buspirone, QHS Ativan 0.5mg.
# HTN: patient's HCTZ and lisinopril were held on admission as 
patient was normotensive in setting of N/V/diarrhea for 4 days. 
Her blood pressure recovered after fluids, and she will restart 
BP medications on discharge.

===================
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES
===================
- MRI head to be performed on ___ as outpatient
- Patient had a RUQ U/S showing echogenic liver consistent with 
steatosis. LFTs were notable for ALT 49, other LFTs 
unremarkable. Please consider further follow-up or workup for 
liver issues.
