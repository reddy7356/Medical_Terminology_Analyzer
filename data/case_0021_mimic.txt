Brief Hospital Course:
___ y/o male with a h/o rheumatic heart disase, severe AS, HTN, 
and hyperlipidemia who presented with worsening SOB, determined 
to have a NSTEMI and left sided heart failure.

NSTEMI/left-sided heart failure - Pt presented to OSH with 
worsening SOB, without CP, and responded fairly wellthought to 
have had plaque rupture, resulting in ischemia and diastolic 
dysfunction, and in the setting of fixed AS developed pulmonary 
edema. Pt was medically managed with Aspirin 325mg, plavix 75mg, 
lipitor 80mg and heparin drip. Beta-blocker was initially held.

Pt underwent cardiac catheterization which showed: 1. Three 
vessel coronary artery disease. 2. Moderate-to-severe aortic 
stenosis. 3. Marked elevation of biventricular filling 
pressures.  Based on these findings, recommendation was made to 
undergo CABG with AVR once recovered from recent carotid stents. 
Pt agreed and underwent screening by CT surg as well as multiple 
pre-op studies and dental work (removal of two teeth). Cardiac 
enzymes continued to trend down and pt was discharged home to 
continue course of plavix, to be stopped 4 days prior to 
surgery. 

HYPERTENSION - Initially held beta-blocker and ACE-inhibitor and 
restarted once renal function improved and CHF better 
controlled. 

HYPERLIPIDEMIA - Pt switched to Lipitor 80 mg in the acute 
setting (on Zocor as outpatient).
 
S/P LEFT CAROTID STENT - Pt had history of stroke/TIA, but had 
persistently normal neuro exams throughout the admission.

that feed blood to your heart. You will need surgery to bypass 
these arteries and fix your aortic valve. A tooth was pulled in 
preperation for the surgery. You had evidence of bacteria in
