Brief Hospital Course:
Reason for hospitalization: ___ year old man with history of DM2, 
dementia, CKD, HTN, HL presents w/ lethargy x 3 days at ___.
.
Active Issues:
#AMS: ___ RN reports a gradual decline in mental and physical 
function over the last year. He is drowsy but arousable, and 
oriented x2 on exam. He answers questions, inappropriately at 
times. Differential included worsening of baseline dementia vs 
polypharmacy vs acute kidney injury vs infection vs stroke vs 
hypothyroidism vs B12 deficiency. His Cr was found to be 
baseline, no infectious source found, and head CT was negative. 
He had no fever or white count. TSH was within normal limits and 
B12 is pending at discharge. We discontinued his sedating 
medications and recommend that the patient continue to hold 
these meds at his ___. We felt that the patient was most likely 
at his baseline decline in mental status and felt it safe for 
him to leave the hospital. However, the underlying cause of his 
mental decline should be addressed as an outpatient (see 
transitional issues below).
.
#CKD: The pt had an elevated creatinine at ___ and was treated 
with 1L NS. His Cr upon arrival was at his baseline and stayed 
there throughout the course of his stay. He did not receive any 
additional fluids. We monitored his ins and outs and trended his 
creatinine. From speaking with ___ RN, it appears that dialysis 
had been discussed with pt and family, but no course has been 
decided over the last year. 
.
#Supratherapeutic INR: Found to be 4.6 at outside ___. Coumadin 
was held and restarted at 2.5mg once INR was rechecked at 2.1. 
On day 2 the INR was found to be 1.6, so coumadin was increased 
to 3.5mg with instructions to take 2.5mg qday alternating with 
3.5mg qod. The pt was on coumadin for history of DVT. It is 
unclear whether or not he should continue. However, with his 
history of frequent falls at ___, it would be wise to consider 
stopping if unnecessary.
.
#Hyperkalemia: Pt came in with K 5.3, which decreased down to 
4.1.
.
Chronic Issues:
.
#Diabetes Mellitus: Replaced pt's home regimen of levemir 10 
units qhs and novolog sliding scale to lantus 10 units qhs and 
humalog SS. Kept on diabetic diet. No issues. Discharged on home 
meds.
.
#CHF: No signs of fluid overload on exam. ECHO ___ shows mild 
LVH and preserved systolic function. Continued home isosorbide 
and hydralazine home regimen.
.
#HTN: Remained well controlled for majority of stay. Continued 
home amlodipine, isosorbide, hydralazine, and labetolol. Held 
propanolol and torsemide to prevent hypotension. Recommend 
continuing all home meds at discharge.
.
#BPH: Stable. Continued home doxazosin and tamsulosin.

#HLD: Not on statin at home.

#h/o CVA: Head CT negative. Kept pt on home ASA 81mg daily.

#Anemia: Hematocrit has remained baseline over the hospital 
stay. It has been decreasing over the last several years per 
OMR. Likely related to CKD. No further workup performed.

#Dementia/neuropsychiatric issues: Specific diagnoses are 
unclear. We continued his home valproate, gabapentin, and 
wellbutrin. We held gabapentin for sedation.

Transitional Issues:
# Discussion of goals of care: Pt's physical and mental status 
appears to be gradually declining over the last year. He 
requires skilled nursing for multiple comorbidities. It is 
unclear whether his neurological findings (history of abnormal 
head imaging, ?spiculated occipital mass, old CVA) warrant 
further management or workup. Goals of care should continue to 
be discussed at extended care facility.  Discussion with patient 
and health care proxy should be considered to clarify code 
status (DNR/DNI per documentation from ___, Full code per son, 
health care proxy).

# Coumadin management: Unclear whether or not the patient should 
continue to stay on coumadin. Per outpatient physician notes, it 
appears that it may not be necessary, as pt has exceeded the 6 
month period following DVT. However, he has history of multiple 
DVTs in the past. Given his report history of frequent falls 
recently, suggest continued discussion regarding plan for 
coumadin moving forward.

Brief Hospital Course:
___ yo M with history of DM, CKI not on HD, HTN, HLD who was 
found on routine labs to have elevated K, elevated lipase and at 
___ ED had low blood sugars.  

Hypoglycemia: Likely related to getting insulin in am and 
missing breakfast.  The patient is was on a complicated regimen 
at home which included Insulin Glargine 10 units qAM as well as 
Insulin Novalin 70/30 28 units in am and 12 units in pm. 
Additionally, the patient was on Glyburide.  The patient was 
mildly symptomatic in the ED when hypoglycemic.  He was 
initially transferred to the ICU on a D10 gtt at 250.  D10 was 
stopped on presentation to ICU as blood sugar > 200.  BS trended 
down to about 150 after half an hour.  Blood sugars were closely 
monitored and the patient was started on ISS with plan to 
reassess insulin need prior to ___.  The patient was discharged 
on a simplified Insulin regimen of 10 units Lantus in AM.  
Glyburide was discontinued.  Arrangements have been made for him 
to receive Insulin administration teaching and supervision by a 
nurse at ___ where he resides.

Elevated Cr: Creatinine has been stable at what appears to be 
the patient's new baseline (1.6 - 2). Increasing Cr likely 
related to worsening renal damage secondary to DM.  We did not 
start the patient on ___ at this time given elevated 
potassium. 

Elevated lipase:  Unclear etiology.  Patient clinically without 
evidence of pancreatitis and is tolerating PO diet very well in 
ED.  No tenderness to palpation.  Lipase has been higher in past 
(300), at that time an abdominal U/S was unrevealing for a 
pathology. ___ be related to fluctuations in renal function

Hyperkalemia: Likely related to worsening renal function.  No 
ECG changes.  Given kayexelate in the ED with resolution.  The 
patient was started on low potassium diet. 

Hypertension: On admission, pt. with hypertension. We started 
Hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg daily. We chhanged Nifedipine from 
10mg three times a day to Nifedipine CR 60mg once a day. This 
resulted in resolution of hypertension.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ was evaluated in the emergency room, where he was 
found to be persistently hyperglycemic, with hyperkalemia on 
laboratory studies, and increased t wave inversions on his EKG 
as compared with a prior study.  While in the emergency 
department he was given 8 units of regular insulin, and was 
given kayexalate for his elevated potassium.  His initial 
troponin check was negative.

# Hyperglycemia - on arrival to the medical floor Mr. ___ 
blood glucose was measured at 207.  He was given 6 units of 
humalog at this point, and his blood glucose was checked every 2 
hours overnight, dipping as low as 70 before rising again to 
197.  Mr. ___ insisted on interview that he had taken his 
insulin as prescribed for the previous several days, but when we 
were able to speak with the staff at his assisted living 
facility, we learned that he had likely taken his Lantus dose 
late in the afternoon, shortly before coming to the ED.  This 
likely is the reason for his blood glucose dipping as low as 69 
overnight.

Also, we discussed his case with the medical team from his prior 
admission, and they explained that he had been observed for 
several days previously on his regimen of Lantus 10 mg Qam.  
This regimen appears to work well for him, and it seems very 
likely that his hyperglycemia was largely due to noncompliance.

# Rule out ACS - Mr. ___ was kept on telemetry overnight, 
and a repeat troponin was drawn in conjunction with a repeat 
EKG.  The troponin remained negative, and the EKG showed no new 
changes, with lessening of previously seen T wave inversions.  
At no time during his hospital stay did he complain of chest 
pain, shortness of breath, or any other symptoms of discomfort.

# Behavioral issues - This appears to a be a chronic 
deterioration over the past several months.  He was very 
pleasant and cooperative in the hospital, but he did describe an 
altercation with a member of the facility's staff, and we were 
told of other behavioral concerns as described above.  We have 
arranged outpatient followup with the cognitive neurology 
department.

# Claudication - On initial history and physical Mr. ___ 
described symptoms consistent with chronic claudication.  He has 
had no recent worsening of his symptoms, and he has good 
arterial pulses on exam.  This should be followed up in an 
outpatient setting.

# Kidney disease - Creatinine was 1.9 on admission - it is 
unclear what his true baseline is currently, but it has ranged 
between 1.4 and 2.1 on recent admissions.  Creatine on morning 
labs had decreased to 1.6, with good urine output.

# Hypertension - has had multiple medication changes recently, 
will continue only on nifedipine for now.  We have discontinued 
HCTZ due to his varying renal function.

# Hematuria - noted in the emergency department to have small 
amount of hematuria, but this resolved on repeat urinalysis.

Code status - confirmed full code

Brief Hospital Course:
PRIMARY REASON FOR ADMISSION:
___ w h/o dCHF, DMII, dementia, stage IV renal insuff, HTN, 
recurrent DVT's on coumadin, prostate CA  reffered from nursing 
home with hypoglycemia and AMS and found to have AoCRF as well 
as pulmonary congestion. 

ACUTE DIAGNOSES:
# Hypoglycemia: The ultimately cause of the patietnt's 
hypoglycemia was undetermined at the time of discharge.  It was 
thought that he had reduced insulin clearance due to his renal 
failure.  His insulin was held during his initial presentation.  
At the time of discharge he had been restarted on an insulin 
regimen without further episodes of hypoglycemia.  

# Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine was 
noted to be elevated from baseline on presentation.  This was 
though to be due to a CHF exacerbation with poor effective 
arterial volume.  A renal ultrasound was obtained that ruled out 
hydronephrosis. his renal failure improved after diuresis.  
While he was in house he was evaluated by the renal team.  An 
upper extremity venous mapping was performed to evaluate the 
patient for a possible fistula in the future.  He will follow up 
with ___ nephrologist 2 weeks after discharge

# Hypoxia: The patient was initially hypoxic & there was some 
concern for a RLL PNA. He was initially started on broad 
spectrum antibiotics, which were tailored down as his 
respiratory status improved after diuresis.  He was discharged 
on levofloxacin, to continue the rest of his course. He was 
afebrile without leukocytosis throughout admission.
  
# Delirium: The patient's initialy delirium (superimposed on 
dementia) was most likely secondary to hypoglycemia.  His mental 
status improved with resolution of hypoglycemia & volume 
overload. An admission head CT was negative for acute 
intracranial process. 

CHRONIC DIAGNOSES:

# DVT: The patient's INR was supratherapeutic on admission.  His 
warfarin was initially held, but was restarted when his INR 
trended down.  He will be discharged on 4 mg QD with a plan to 
follow his INR and redose warfarin as needed.
 
# HTN: The patient's labetalol was initially held.  Restarted 
nifedipine SR, tamsulosin, doxazosin and continued to hold 
Labetolol on transfer to the floor given controlled BP's.  Pt 
was discharged on hydralazine and advised to discontinue 
labetalol & hold metolazone & torsemide until following up with 
his nephrologist.

# HLD: LDL noted to be below 100.

# Neuropsychiatric Issues: The patient was continued on 
fluoxetine, VPA, Gapapentin

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: 
# Follow-Up: The patien will follow up with his nephrologist in 
2 weeks. 

# Code Status: DNR/DNI. Unfortunately, the patient's son does 
not wish to be contrted regarding his father.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ is a ___ year-old man with a history of DM2, CKD, 
HTN, who was found on routine labs to be in acute renal failure 
with hyperkalemia. 
.  
# Hyperkalemia:  Likely secondary to renal insufficiency.  No 
obvious medication or dietary culprit. No EKG changes.  He has 
had a similar scenario in the past that resolved with kayexalate 
alone.  He received a total of 70mg of kayexalate overnight with 
slow improvement of his postassium levels.  He was given gentle 
IV fluids and lasix prior to discharge to assist with potassium 
depletion.  Would consider that as the patient is diabetic, he 
likely has a component of hyporenin hypoaldosteronism induced 
Type 4 Renal Tubular acidosis.  He was started on daily 10mg 
Lasix to assist with potassium levels.  Would tolerate a slight 
elevation of creatinine to keep chronically elevated potassium 
levels down.
.
# Acute on chronic renal insuffiency versus progression of 
chronic renal insufficiency, since no creatinine checked since 
___.  Baseline renal insufficiency is likely secondary to 
diabetic nephropathy.   No change in diet, no signs of infection 
that could be trigger for insult. His creatinine improved 
overnight from 2.2 on admission to 1.9 prior to discharge. 
.  
# DM2:  He is on glargine 30 units in the morning and lispro 
sliding scale.  Blood sugars were controlled with an insulin 
sliding scale while an inpatient.
.  
# HTN: He was continued on nifedipine.  His blood pressures were 
elevated on admission and were exacerbated by IV fluids on HD 2. 
He was given lasix to assist with diuresis and hyperkalemia.
.
# HLD: He was continued on his statin.
.  
# Depression: He was continued on citalopram.
.  
# Old CVA: He was cotninued on Aspirin 81 mg.
.
