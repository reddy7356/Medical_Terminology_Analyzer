IMAGING
  
___ CTA CHEST:  
1. No pulmonary embolism or dissection detected. No acute lung 
parenchymal abnormalities are present. There is minimal 
atelectasis versus scarring within the left lung base.  
2. Healing left 10th rib fracture.  
3. Fatty liver.  

CXR ___: No relevant changes compared to the previous 
radiograph. No acute cardiopulmonary process.

Repeat CXR ___: In comparison with the study of ___, there is 
again some enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with tortuosity 
of the aorta and prominence of interstitial markings. No 
convincing evidence of acute pneumonia.
 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ year old ___ woman with history of chronic cough 
and reactive airway disease, post nasal drip, sinusitis, HTN, 
with exacerbation of reactive airway disease secondary to 
influenza A viral URI.

1. Exacerbation of reactive airway disease secondary to viral 
URI: 
The patient initially presented on ___ from clinic with 
fever to 101.9, worsened SOB and nonproductive cough. CTA was 
negative for PE or acute cardiopulmonary process. She was 
treated for exacerbation of reactive airway disease with 
nebs/azithromycin then was found to have nasal swab positive for 
influenza A virus. Viral infection with influenza A was the 
likely precipitant to her exacerbation of chronic cough and 
reactive airway disease with decreased peak flow measurements 
(100-200s). She had received the flu vaccine this year and did 
not have baseline peak flow measurements to compare with. There 
was no evidence of bacterial infection, although patient 
received 3 days of azithromycin for presumed reactive airway 
disease exacerbation. The patient's breathing improved with 
steroids, nebulizers, guaifenesin. She was breathing comfortably 
with good O2 sat on RA and had been afebrile with no evidence of 
other infection by UA, BCx, CXR. Urine legionella negative. 
Repeat CXR also negative for PNA. On discharge, her peak flow 
had improved from 100 to 200. She was discharged to finish the 
last 2 days of her prednisone course, albuterol inhalers prn, 
and instructions to wear a mask for the 5 days post discharge. 
In discharge, she was scheduled for an appointment with Dr. 
___ pulmonologist, for repeat lung function tests and 
evaluation, on ___.

Of note, the patient has a history of wheezing with URIs and was 
given the presumptive diagnosis of asthma in the past but with 
no relief of SOB with albuterol and corticosteroids. She was 
evaluated by pulmonology on ___ and found to have no 
obstructive pattern by PFTs. On a recent evaluation by Dr. ___ 
in allergy, her chronic cough is likely due to post-nasal drip 
and asthma. 

2. Anemia: The patient's Hct was slightly decreased this 
hospital stay (lowest of 30.9) but returned to her baseline 
without intervention. She was guiac negative and had no other 
signs of bleeding. Had Fe studies showing Fe 27, Ferritin 25 c/w 
Fe deficiency anemia. She was recommended to follow up with an 
outpatient colonoscopy to f/u on colonic adenoma polyp found in 
___.

3. Lower extremity edema: She had no evidence of CHF with no 
prior history and BNP 442. LVEF on MIBI from ___ was preserved. 
Her edema also could have been secondary to her pulmonary edema, 
OSA, or a side effect of her norvasc. Her norvasc was held and 
her blood pressures remained stable. Her edema improved on her 
normal outpatient dose of 20mg PO daily lasix but she was 
discharged with directions to take 2 days of double her 
outpatient dose of lasix and then to continue with her home dose 
and follow up with her PCP. She was also discharged off her 
norvasc with follow up with her PCP.

4. HTN: Her blood pressure remained stable off her norvasc and 
she was continued on her HCTZ and atenolol for BP control.

History of Present Illness:
Ms. ___ is an ___ woman with a history of 
hypercholesterolemia, hypertension, nonallergic rhinitis, 
chronic sinusitis, and chronic cough who presents with cough, 
wheezing, and shortness of breath.  Per the patient, she 
developed an increasing cough over the last week associated with 
wheezy.  She was seen in HCA on ___ and was sent to the ED for 
evaluation due to the concern of hypoxia to 94% and possible 
ischemia based on an EKG.  She was admitted overnight (discharge 
summary not complete) and treated for asthma exacerbation 
(although no clear history of this) with nebs and steroids, and 
advair was added back to her regimen.  She went home on ___ and 
started to wheeze again.  Her granddaughter called Dr. ___ 
on ___ because they thought she was supposed to be on a steroid 
taper, but was not discharged on steroids.  He prescribed a 
short steroid burst which she started taking on ___ with mild 
improvement.  However, last night her wheezing got much worse 
and she couldn't stop coughing due to her GERD and nasal drip.  
She normally feels SOB when coughing, but otherwise did not feel 
SOB.  She was concerned about her wheezing and presented to OSH 
for evaluation.  Of note, she denies PND but does not like to 
lie flat because her coughing worsens.  She states that the only 
time she feels SOB is when she is coughing, and the coughing 
fits can happen either at rest or with exertion, and there is no 
pattern.  The coughing worsens if she has a URI or allergy 
symptoms.  Additionally, when asked what is more concerning to 
her, her audible wheeze or feeling SOB, she states the wheezy is 
her most prominent and concerning symptom and that the SOB is in 
the setting of the cough.  No fevers, chills, nausea, vomiting.  
No chest pain, palpatations, weight gain, ___ edema (edema 
improved). 

Vitals recorded by EMS were 146/52, 82, 18, 100%. At ___ 
___ she received duoneb, Solumedrol 125mg and magnesium.  
Transferred to ___ where initial vitals were 96.7, 73, 162/90, 
20, 98% on 4L.  CXR initially thought to have LLL infiltrate and 
received ceftriaxone and azithromycin, but radiology later read 
it as normal.  Was audibly wheezing and received an additional 
125mg IV solumedrol and multiple rounds of albuterol and 
atrovent nebs.  Flu sent and was negative.  EKG with new ST 
depressions in V4-V6, CE's negative.  Recieved 500cc IVFs and 
100mg thiamine.  ABG prior to BIPAP was 7.37/40/109.  Received 
BIPAP for one hour with some improvement in symptoms. Of note 
lactate 5.5 to 5.3 to 8.2 over 6 hrs, unclear etiology as no 
abdominal pain, hypotension, not felt to be septic physiology. 

Currently the patient is without complaints.  She is not SOB or 
wheezy and feels much better when compared to presentation.  No 
chest pain.

sinusitis, post-nasal drip, GERD, chronic cough and wheezing, 
HTN, hypercholesteremia, and CAD who presents with cough and 
wheezing.  

# Cough/Wheeze/SOB – Significant workup as outpatient with 
possibly some component of asthma based on flow/volume curves on 
recent spirometry.  Seems that most of the complaint is from 
hearing herself wheeze which further exacerbates the cough which 
then leads to SOB.  Post nasal drip present causing cough, as 
well as GERD.  She was transiently treated with BiPAP in the ED 
with improvement in her symptoms.  The morning after admission, 
she was not requiring oxygen and her wheezing had improved.  It 
seemed that most of her wheezing was upper airway generated near 
her neck.  She will need followup with Pulmonary and Sleep to 
further assess the question of whether asthma is present based 
on the PFT tracings. Sleep study was done, but results are still 
pending.  The patient tolerated CPAP in house, so getting her 
CPAP machine at home would be beneficial.  She will need to 
followup with the sleep clinic for further titration of her CPAP 
settings.  The patient is closely followed by allergy, but she 
would likely also benefit from further evaluation by ENT to 
address the issue of chronic sinusitis and post nasal drip to 
see if there are any other options available.  PCP followup will 
be arranged to discuss further therapy.  She needs close 
followup as an outpatient to prevent frequent hospitalization 
for these symptoms.  She will need BID PPI and GI followup for 
possible EGD to evaluate her GERD.  She will continue her home 
medications.  The prednisone will be tapered off rapidly (40 mg 
on ___, 20 mg ___, 10 mg ___, then off).  She had 3 sets of 
cardiac enzymes which were negative.  CXR did not show any acute 
process.  An ECHO was done which showed normal EF and slightly 
decreased pulmonary artery sytolic hypertension. 

# Elevated lactate – lactate improving- unclear etiology.  No 
metabolic acidosis present, though did have gap 15.  It was 
unclear how to interpret these results. It resolved with some 
IVFs.  She was hemodynamically stable. 

# GERD - BID PPI

# HTN - cont home HCTZ, lisinopril, atenolol

# Anemia - Currently stable.  Iron deficiency on past labs.  
Continue to  monitor

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted for wheezing and shortness of breath.  It is 
thought that this is likely due to your post nasal drip and 
chronic sinsusitis causing a cough and leading to reactive 
airways.  You were transiently on BiPAP and then treated with 
inhalers and a rapid steroid taper.  You improved during this 
hospitalization.  You were also started on CPAP at night for 
your likely obstructive sleep apnea.  Please take all 
medications as prescribed.  Please keep all scheduled 
appointments.

If you develop any of the following concerning symptoms, please 
call your PCP or go to the ED: chest pains, shortness of breath, 
inability to breath, fever, chills, nausea or vomiting.

Brief Hospital Course:
# Shortness of Breath, Productive Cough: Etiology concerning for 
acute bronchitis versus asthma attack verus reactive airway.  
Symptoms of productive cough and chills concerning for 
bronchitis.  She was treated with 5 days of azithromycin.  Given 
mild restrictive pattern on  previous PFTs and distant smoking 
history not likely COPD exacerbation.  She has a history of 
asthma and allergic rhinitis, therefore may be componenent of 
reactive airway disease.  She was treated with standing 
nebulizer treatments and oral prednisone for 5 days.  Her cough 
was treated with guaifenacin and codeine.  She received a one 
time dose of Tessalon Perles for pain with coughing.  BNP 
elevated on admission concerning for mild CHF exacerbation 
however benign lung exam, no JVD, unremarkable CXR and mild 
stable peripheral edema so she was not diuresed.  Previous echo 
in ___ revealed CHF > 55%.  She should follow up with her 
outpatient cardiologist regarding this admission. Physical 
therapy evaluated the patient and she did not require home 
oxygen. She was continued on amlodipine, atenolol, hctz and 
lisinopril
.  
# Urinary Frequency: Ms. ___ reports a history of urinary 
frequency. Urinalysis was unremarkable.  No symptoms of pain 
with urination, fevers or flank tenderness at this time.

FINDINGS: Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained. 
Mild left 
base opacity may reflect atelectasis, although an early 
consolidation cannot 
be entirely excluded. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is 
seen. There is 
unchanged prominence of the right hilum. The aorta remains 
calcified and 
tortuous. The cardiac silhouette is top normal to mildly 
enlarged. Bilateral 
humeral prostheses are partially imaged. There is diffuse 
osteopenia.

atelectasis, 
although an early/mild consolidation cannot be entirely 
excluded.
