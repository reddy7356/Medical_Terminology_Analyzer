IMAGING & STUDIES
=================
___ OPINION MR TORSO
IMPRESSION:  
1.  Status post cholecystectomy.  No intrahepatic or 
extrahepatic biliary duct dilatation. 
2.  3 cm left adrenal adenoma.

 
Brief Hospital Course:
Patient is a ___ female with a past medical history of 
COPD and recent elevation in her LFTs, particularly her total 
bilirubin, who presents for evaluation of painless jaundice and 
pruritus.

The patient was recently evaluated at ___. Records 
from that admission were reviewed and were significant for 
downtrending transaminitis and normal MRCP. There was concern 
that her transaminitis was from a drug-induced liver injury 
possibly in the setting of taking Augmentin, Tylenol, NSAIDs, 
and/or alcohol use. Given her continued improvement this seems 
like a reasonable diagnosis and further workup was deferred. She 
was started on ursodiol and cholestyramine for pruritus. 
Prednisone was stopped as we feel it is less likely that this 
represents an autoimmune hepatitis.

Had incidental findings on OSH imaging to be followed up by PCP.

Transitional issues:
[] Patient should have LFTs checked before ___ to 
ensure that they continue to improve.
[] Recommend listing Augmentin as a possible allergy since most 
plausible culprit for her liver injury.
[] Patient should have full workup of anemia (would resend iron 
studies once liver inflammation has resolved) including 
colonoscopy if not up to date.
[] Needs HBV and HAV vaccines
[] Has dysplastic vocal cord polyp that should be followed up as 
an outpatient as well as incidental lung nodules and adrenal 
mass
[] Consider PFTs and controller medication for COPD

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,

You were admitted to the hospital because you had elevated liver 
enzymes.  Specifically your bilirubin level was quite high.  We 
monitor your liver tests and since they were improving without 
any intervention. As a result, it was not necessary to do a 
liver biopsy. 

It seems most likely that you suffered some liver damage from a 
combination of medications including antibiotics, Tylenol, 
NSAIDs (such as ibuprofen), and alcohol use. We recommend that 
you list Augmentin (Amoxicillin Trihydrate/Potassium 
Clavulanate) as one of your possible medication allergies.

You should be cautious about starting any new medications until 
your liver tests have returned to normal.  You should also 
abstain from alcohol.

We stopped your prednisone because we think it is less likely 
that you have autoimmune liver disease.  We started a medication 
called ursodiol for your itching.

On your outside imaging, you also had incidental findings that 
will need to be followed up by your primary care physician such 
as lung nodules, adrenal lesion and vocal cord polyp.

You can follow-up with your primary care doctor and outpatient 
gastroenterologists as previously scheduled.  If you wish to 
schedule an appointment at the ___ hepatology office, you can 
call ___.

It was a pleasure taking care of you.

Sincerely,
Your ___ care team
