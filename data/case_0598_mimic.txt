History of Present Illness:
___ with Stage IIa Hodgkins lymphoma diagnosed in ___ s/p 2 
cycles of ABVD chemotherapy (last treatment on ___, and on 
Neupogen x 3 days upon completion) who presents with fever to 
104 x 1 day and several days of redness over her port. 

Of note patient was recently admitted to thoracic surgery 
service in ___ for mediastinal mass and had undergone 
mediastinoscopy and aspiration of chest wall mass at right 
breast on ___. A large mass in the upper mediastinal nodal 
area was noted. When the mass was dissected approximately 20 cc 
of purulence was expressed. Cultures and stains were negative 
and pathology revealed Hodgkins lymphoma. On ___, she was 
found to have some redness at the mediastinoscopy incision site 
which was concerning for cellulitis. She was treated with a 
course of keflex without resolution of the erythema and 
induration at the wound site was not changed and thick pus began 
to leak from a new opening in the wound and a second drainage 
site later developed. Patient was taken back to the OR for I&D 
and 20 cc of pus drained form the old cervical mediastinoscopy 
incision. A portacath was placed in the OR on ___ via the 
right subclavian. She was given IV vancomycin and was 
transitioned to PO keflex complete 7-day course after port 
insertion but still had discharge from her neck incison. 
Chemotherapy was started on ___ with AVBD Q2weeks. 

During her last visit on ___ the patient reported issues with 
needle acces by nursing. On ___ she felt muscle ache around 
port area and noticed redness around the port without any 
discharge which became more intense overtime. She developed 
shaking chills, loss of energy and fever 104 and presented to 
clinic day prior to admission where she was noted to have a 
tender erythematous port site over her R upper chest extending 
down to her right arm, concerning for infection. A peripheral IV 
was attempted because of reluctance to access her port, but 
unsuccessful. The patient was subsequently referred to the ___ 
ED. 

In ED/Clinic, initial VS 103, HR 139, BP 105/49, RR 16, and SpO2 
99% on 2L. Labs were notable for lactate 2.4, WBC 2.4 with 64% 
PMNs, 8% bandenua. CXR showed no focal infiltrate. The patient 
was started on vancomycin prior to transfer to floor. Blood 
cultures x 2 were drawn. 

In the OR, port site was incised and drained for about 40-50cc's 
of pus. Plan had been to transfer to medical oncology floor 
post-operatively, however patient remained tachycardic and 
hypotensive in PACU, transfered to TSICU where she was bolused 
about 2L of IV and required pressors (initially 1.8mcg/kg/min 
and weaned off at 8am) overnight which were discontinued this 
AM. Vitals prior to transfer were T 100 BP 124/53, HR 102, RR 
26, POx 96% RA

Upon arrival patient VSS and patient voices no acute complaints. 
She denies cough, pleuritic chest pain, SOB, abdominal pain, 
n/V, diarrhea, legs pain, rash.

CXR ___:
FINDINGS:  Single portable view of the chest.  Relatively low 
lung volumes are again seen.  Right chest wall port is seen with 
catheter tip at the upper SVC. 
The lungs are clear without consolidation, large effusion or 
vascular congestion.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is 
stable. 
  
IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary process. 
 
CXR ___:  
FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, the patient has 
taken a better inspiration.  The cardiac silhouette remains 
within normal limits in size and there is no evidence of acute 
focal pneumonia or vascular congestion. 

echo ___
The left atrium is normal in size. No atrial septal defect is 
seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thickness, 
cavity size, and global systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%). 
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion 
abnormality cannot be fully excluded. There is no ventricular 
septal defect. with normal free wall contractility. The 
diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels are 
normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal 
with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic 
regurgitation. No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic 
valve. The mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal. No 
mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve. Mild (1+) mitral 
regurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic 
hypertension. No vegetation/mass is seen on the pulmonic valve. 
There is no pericardial effusion.

CHEST XRAY ___ post picc line placement:
IMPRESSION:  
Left PICC terminates in the low SVC. 

CHEST XRAY PA & LAT ___
IMPRESSION:  
In comparison with the study ___, there is no change or 
evidence of 
acute cardiopulmonary disease.  CVP catheter remains in place. 

CT CHEST W/O CONTRSAT ___ 
IMPRESSION: 
1. Dominant right upper chest wall cystic collection is larger 
as detailed above. Smaller cystic collections in the anterior 
mediastinum are significantly decreased. 
2. Mediastinal lymphadenopathy is smaller. 
3. Multiple left lower lobe opacities are concerning for 
aspiration. 
4. Left PICC line is displaced, coiled in the right 
brachiocephalic vein and should be repositioned. 

DOPPLER U/S RIGHT UPPER EXT ___
IMPRESSION:  
No evidence of deep vein thrombosis in the right upper 
extremity. Subcutaneous soft tissue thickening at the right 
forearm. 

PORTABLE CHEST XRAY ___
IMPRESSION:  
  
In comparison with the study ___, the tip of the 
subclavian catheter is either at the cavoatrial junction or in 
the upper portion of the right atrium. Because of the danger of 
the tube being pulled back substantially with a power injection 
at CT, it would probably be best to leave the catheter where it 
is unless there are any atypical atrial beats.

Successful US-guided placement of ___ ___ pigtail 
catheter into the subcutaneous right anterior chest wall 
collection. Samples was sent for microbiology and cytology 
evaluation

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,

It was a privilege caring for you here at ___. You came into 
the hospital because of an infection around your port-a-cath and 
in your blood with bacteria. Your port was removed and you have 
been treated with IV antibiotics which you will continue for 
4-weeks. You needed another line since your port was removed and 
so you had a PICC line placed for your antibiotics. You also had 
drainage of a collection of fluid near the port site, which did 
not grow bacteria. At the time of discharge, you were feeling 
improved. You will continue follow-up with your oncologist as an 
outpatient, as you received further chemotherapy this admission.

You need to continue to take care of the wound at the site of 
your previous port-a-cath. Nursing services have been arranged 
to help with that at home.

You also received a bone marrow stimulant to improve your cell 
counts following chemotherapy and will continue for 2 more doses 
while at home.

Please keep all your doctors' appointments.

All the Best!

Your ___ team.

History of Present Illness:
Ms. ___ is a very pleasant ___ year old female who
underwent mediastinoscopy and aspiration of chest wall mass at
right breast ___. Pathology was consistent with nodular
sclerosing hodgkins disease. A cavity was encouterered
inside of the mediastinal mass with 20cc of purulent fluid.
Cultures from the fluid were negative.

At her first follow up appointment ___, she was found to 
have
some redness at the mediastinoscopy incision site which was
concerning for cellulitis. She was given cephalexin 500 bid x 7
days, with follow up in clinic in 1 week, at which the erythema
and induration had not changed appreciably. 

5 days ago, she noted that thick pus began to leak from a new
opening in the wound. Shortly thereafter, a second opening from
the wound developed which began draining thinner yellow fluid.
The first opening has closed, but she continues to have leakage
of yellow fluid from the second opening which has required two
dressing changes per day for the past 4 days. She denies fevers
or pain at the site, and reports that the induration and 
erythema
have improved. She presents now for surgical I&D.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ was admitted to the hospital and taken to the 
Operating Room where she underwent an incision and drainage of a 
cervical mediastinoscopy wound with evacuation of deep cervical 
abscess. She tolerated the procedure well and returned to the 
PACU in stable condition.  She maintained stable hemodynamics 
and her pain was minimal.

Following transfer to the Surgical floor her wound was observed 
frequently and had some surrounding erythema noted without 
cellulitis.  She remained afebrile but her blood sugars were not 
controlled which seems to be a pre op problem as well. Her WBC 
remained elevated despite Vancomycin therapy but her intraop 
cultures were negative thus far.

She returned to the OR on ___ for placement of her portacath 
via the right subclavian.  She tolerated that procedure well and 
this will eventually be used for her chemotherapy.  The 
portacath will be managed by the ___ Oncology 
Department.

Her blood sugars were not controlled and she was encouraged to 
check them QID and use regular sliding scal coverage along with 
her Lantus to maintain better control.  She will call her PCP if 
there's no improvement.  She was discharged home after her 
portacath placement on a seven day course of Keflex and she'll 
follow up in the Thoracic Clinic in 2 weeks.

STUDIES/IMAGING
==============
___ CXR: 
Subtle increase veil like opacities within the bilateral upper 
lungs. Findings raise concern for an atypical pneumonia

___ CTA CHEST:
1. Diffuse ground-glass opacities seen throughout both lungs 
have progressed since ___ and are suggestive of 
atypical infection or could also represent pulmonary edema.
2. No evidence of pulmonary embolism to the subsegmental level.

___ ABD ULTRASOUND:
1.  Normal liver echotexture. No concerning hepatic mass. No 
intrahepatic bile duct dilation.
2.  Normal waveforms and flow directions of the portal veins, 
hepatic veins, and hepatic arteries.

___ Cardiovascular ECHO 
The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall 
thickness, cavity size, and global systolic function are normal 
(LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall 
motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. The estimated 
cardiac index is normal (>=2.5L/min/m2). Doppler parameters are 
indeterminate for left ventricular diastolic function. Right 
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The 
diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels are 
normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but 
aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. 
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no 
mitral valve prolapse. There is trivial mitral regurgitation. 
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined. 
There is no pericardial effusion. 

IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Normal global 
biventricular systolic function. Technically suboptimal to 
exclude focal wall motion abnormality. Diastolic parameters 
indeterminate to asses diastolic function. No pathologic 
valvular abnormalities.

 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ y/o F with Hodgkins lymphoma (most recent chemo ___ and 
recent admission for PNA presents with recurrent hypoxia and 
cough and CT chest c/f atypical infectious process vs. 
congestive heart failure.

# Healthcare associated PNA: Patient initially presented with 
sepsis (tachycardia, elevated bands, fever) though hemodynamics 
much improved s/p IVF and antibiotics in the ED. She required 5L 
NC on arrival to floor. CTA negative for PE, but showed diffuse 
pulm opacities concerning for pulm edema vs PNA. Given immune 
suppressed state and CT appearance, there was concern for PCP 
___. Pulm was consulted and recommended bronchoscopy, but 
patient declined. She was treated with vanc/cefepime/azithro and 
defervesced. Urine legionella neg.  B-glucan returned positive 
on ___, aspergillus gal-antigen negative, CMV viral load neg, 
neg sputum for PCP. She was transitioned to levofloxacin for 
planned 14 day course.

# Pulmonary edema: Pt with dyspnea and hypoxia on admission as 
above. Imaging was concerning for diffuse pulmonary edema. 
Elevated JVP on exam and proBNP >13k. Respiratory status rapidly 
improved with IV lasix bolus and she was weaned off of oxygen. 
TTE this admission showed normal EF but could not rule out 
diastolic dysfunction. Decompensated CHF likely in the setting 
of sepsis, fluid resuscitation.

# Transaminitis - Patient has elevated AST/ALT, new since 
discharge on ___. Negative HAV Ab and HCV Ab documented in 
___. RUQ ultrasound did not show any liver lesions, ductal 
dilitation, or hepatic vein thrombosis. Hep B SAg and SAb neg.
Likely hepatic congestion from CHF given improvement with 
diuresis. 

# Diarrhea - Patient reports having diarrhea for two days. 
Describes it as nonbloody watery stool. Recent exposure to 
health care system and recent abx use, concern for Cdiff. Urine 
legionella negative and C.diff neg on ___. 

# H/o wound infection: Wound nurse was consulted for right chest 
wall wound. Pt will have continued wound care with ___. 

# DM2: Held glyburide while inpatient in favor of sliding scale. 
Continued home lantus 15 qhs.

#HTN - Continued to hold atenolol and lisinopril since last 
admission

#GLAUCOMA - continued travoprost home eye drops 

#ASTHMA - continued home albuterol

#STAGE IIa HODGKIN'S LYMPHOMA - per pt last chemo was ___ 
(though this is not clearly noted in heme/onc spreadsheet). Her 
ANC fell below 500 on ___.  She received Neupogen 300mcg 
X 3 on ___ and ___ with recovery of 
her counts on ___. Per Dr. ___ skip a cycle 
of chemo. Patient has f/u scheduled for ___.

# Vaginal itching - pt was using monostat gel as outpatient, 
likely developed this after getting antibiotics during recent 
admission. Treated with  topical miconazole (last day ___

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___, 

It was a pleasure taking care of you during your hospitalization 
at ___. You presented with 
fever and shortness of breath, requiring supplemental oxygen. 
You received a chest X-ray, which showed a possible pneumonia. 
You also received a CT scan of your chest, which ruled out a 
blood clot in your lungs.

We started you on antibiotics while you were in the hospital and 
gave you Lasix to take fluid out of your lungs. We also did an 
echocardiogram, which showed that your heart was squeezing well. 
The pulmonologists also saw you while you were in the hospital. 

Your breathing improved and you no longer needed any 
supplemental oxygen. We have discontinued the intravenous 
antibiotics and switched you to an oral antibiotic 
(levofloxacin), which you can take by mouth for an additional 9 
days. You will follow up with Dr. ___ on ___.

Best,

Your ___ Care Team
