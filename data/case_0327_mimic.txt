2. OCP: Pt. did not have this while inpatient but will resume

have ___ insurance.  She has begun the process of 
applying for ___, but she is currently 
without insurance.  ___ stated that she is prepared for the 
possibility that she might not be able to return to school.

#)RISK ASSESSMENT
Ms. ___ is at a low immediate risk of harm to self or 
others 
given that she is not suicidal or homicidal, is feeling well and 
has not reported any symptoms of depression while here.  She 
participated well in the milieu.  She is being discharged with 
outpatient follow up to her home in the community, which is the 
least restrictive environment appropriate for her at this time. 
Despite her recent history of a suicide attempt in the setting 
of depression, her current risk of harm to others is low given 
that she has remained in good behavioral control throughout this 
hospitalization. Her suicide attempts seem to represent 
impulsive acts that happen during times when she is feeling low 
and is unable to tolerate her frustration.  The patient is at 
chronic risk of harm to self due to her history of several 
previous attempts that also seem to have been impulsive.  She 
reports feeling fine outside of these moments, but her 
impulsivity is a primary risk factor.  She is also at chronic 
risk due to her trauma history, estrangement from her family, 
and lack of family or close social supports.  Additionally, she 
has a number of modifiable risk factors including lack of 
treatment, no insurance, no ability to get medications.  We 
mitigated these risks by providing inpatient hospitalization on 
a locked psychiatric unit, daily individual, group, and milieu 
therapy, and re-starting her previous abilify and prozac. 
Additionally, she has follow-up appointments scheduled and has 
started the process of getting insurance.  She has a several 
protective factors which include intelligence, future-oriented 
thinking, and motivation.  Her current risk is low for  
intentional self-harm given that she denies suicidal ideation, 
intent and plan, is willing to accept treatment, is currently 
sober, and is future oriented with a goal to stay out of the 
hospital and to try to get treatment to prevent future suicide 
attempts.
