Brief Hospital Course:
 The patient was admitted to the orthopedic surgery service and 
was taken to the operating room for above described procedure. 
Please see separately dictated operative report for details. The 
surgery was uncomplicated and the patient tolerated the 
procedure well. Patient received perioperative IV antibiotics.

Postoperative course was remarkable for the following:

On POD#1, the patient was orthostatic with ___. Her blood 
pressure dropped to 84/46 and she reported feeling dizzy. A 
500cc NS bolus was administered. 
POD#2, the patient had a hematocrit of 21.9 and was given 2 
units PRBCs with appropriate response.
POD#3 Patient had calf discomfort and an ultrasound was found to 
be negative for DVT. Patient complains of loose stools. A sample 
was sent for C.Diff. Results are pending. 

Otherwise, pain was controlled with a combination of IV and oral 
pain medications.  The patient received Aspirin 81 mg twice 
daily for DVT prophylaxis starting on the morning of POD#1.  The 
surgical dressing will remain on until POD#7 after surgery.  The 
patient was seen daily by physical therapy. Labs were checked 
throughout the hospital course and repleted accordingly. At the 
time of discharge the patient was tolerating a regular diet and 
feeling well.  The patient was afebrile with stable vital signs. 
 The patient's hematocrit was acceptable and pain was adequately 
controlled on an oral regimen. The operative extremity was 
neurovascularly intact and the dressing was intact.

Discharge Instructions:
1. Please return to the emergency department or notify your 
physician if you experience any of the following: severe pain 
not relieved by medication, increased swelling, decreased 
sensation, difficulty with movement, fevers greater than 101.5, 
shaking chills, increasing redness or drainage from the incision 
site, chest pain, shortness of breath or any other concerns.
 
2. Please follow up with your primary physician regarding this 
admission and any new medications and refills. 
 
3. Resume your home medications unless otherwise instructed.
 
4. You have been given medications for pain control. Please do 
not drive, operate heavy machinery, or drink alcohol while 
taking these medications. As your pain decreases, take fewer 
tablets and increase the time between doses. This medication can 
cause constipation, so you should drink plenty of water daily 
and take a stool softener (such as Colace) as needed to prevent 
this side effect.  Call your surgeons office 3 days before you 
are out of medication so that it can be refilled.  These 
medications cannot be called into your pharmacy and must be 
picked up in the clinic or mailed to your house.  Please allow 
an extra 2 days if you would like your medication mailed to your 
home.
 
5. You may not drive a car until cleared to do so by your 
surgeon.
 
6. Please call your surgeon's office to schedule or confirm your 
follow-up appointment.
 
7. SWELLING: Ice the operative joint 20 minutes at a time, 
especially after activity or physical therapy. Do not place ice 
directly on the skin. Please DO NOT take any non-steroidal 
anti-inflammatory medications (NSAIDs such as Celebrex, 
ibuprofen, Advil, Aleve, Motrin, naproxen etc) until cleared by 
your physician.
 
8. ANTICOAGULATION: Please continue your Aspirin 81 twice daily 
with food for four (4) weeks to help prevent deep vein 
thrombosis (blood clots).  Continue Pantoprazole daily while on 
Aspirin to prevent GI upset (x 4 weeks).  If you were taking 
Aspirin prior to your surgery, take it at 81 mg twice daily 
until the end of the 4 weeks, then you can go back to your 
normal dosing.

History of Present Illness:
Ms. ___ is a ___ woman with history of chronic 
daily migraines, hypthyroidism, GERD, fibromyalgia, OA s/p THR 
with no prior cardiac history (negative stress test ___ years 
ago_ who was transferred from ___ for substernal 
left-sided chest pain going to left shoulder and into her neck.

Her pain started the morning of admission with associated 
shortness of breath. She previously had an EKG without left 
bundle branch block. She was noted at ___ to have a new left 
bundle branch block. She was given nitroglycerin to which she 
experienced symptomatic relief. Consequently, cardiology 
requested transfer for ccoronary angiography at ___. 
She also received aspirin at ___.

In the ___ ED, she continued to endorses some persistent mild 
left chest discomfort. Initial vitals: T 97.5, HR 88, BP 135/83, 
RR 18, O2 Sat 100% on RA. EKG showed sinus rhythm, probable left 
atrial enlargement, new left  bundle branch block. Labs/studies 
notable for Troponin-T negative x3. CXR demonstrated interval 
left pleural effusion with bilateral low lung volumes. Patient 
was given Nitroglycerin and heparin infusions, clonazepam 0.5 mg 
x2, atorvastatin 80 mg, metoprolol tartrate 6.25 mg x3, 
gabapentin 600 +200 mg, tramadol 50 mg, levothyroxine 50 mcg,

LPM via NC.

After arrival to the cardiology ward, patient endorsed the 
history as outlined above. She noted that she had sudden onset 
of chest pain beneath her left breast which she described as a 
constant stabbing. She noted that the nitroglycerin has relieved 
her pain. Overnight when her nitroglycerin was stopped, the pain 
returned to the point of her being in tears. She noted she had 
had chest pain in the past radiating to her shoulder which was 
associated with her chronic daily migraines. She feels that this 
pain is different and new. She notes that at OSH she also 
received an Ativan which also helped the pain go away. She notes 
she has felt anxious all day today. When asked about any stress 
or triggering events she recounts trauma over the past year and 
a half stemming from her THR, filing a case against her surgeon 
(a family friend) and suffering abuse at the rehabilitation 
facility. She also notes that on ___ when she was ___ years 
old, she struck and killed a ___ year-old in an accident. She 
notes she has been evaluated by a psychiatrist and psychologist 
and does suffer from PTSD from these events. She was previously 
on clonidine 3 mg daily and has been weaning down, recently 
downtitrating from 0.75 mg to 0.5 mg nightly.

RESTING DATA
EKG:  SINUS, LBBB 
HEART RATE:  85BLOOD PRESSURE:  124/72
This ___ year old woman was referred to the lab from the 
inpatient floor following negative serial cardiac biomarkers for 
evaluation of atypical chest discomfort, shortness of breath and 
a new LBBB. The patient was administered 0.4 mg of regadenoson 
IV bolus over 20 seconds. At 2 minutes post-exercise the patient 
reported a brief (lasting ___ minutes) sharp lower left chest 
pain, which was similar to the discomfort she was referred for. 
In the setting of baseline LBBB, the ST segments are 
uninterpretable for ischemia. The rhythm was sinus with frequent 
isolated VPBs, several ventricular couplets and one isolated 
APB. Appropriate blood pressure and heart rate responses to the 
infusion and in recovery. Post-MIBI, the regadenoson was 
reversed with 60 mg IV caffeine. 
IMPRESSION: Atypical type symptoms with uninterpretable ST 
segment changes for ischemia in the setting of baseline LBBB. 
Appropriate hemodynamic response to vasodilator stress.
IMAGING: The image quality is adequate but limited due to soft 
tissue and breast attenuation.  Left ventricular cavity size is 
increased. Rest and stress perfusion images reveal uniform 
tracer uptake throughout the left ventricular myocardium. Gated 
images reveal severe global hypokinesis. The calculated left 
ventricular ejection fraction is 27% with an EDV of 106 ml. 
IMPRESSION: 1. Normal myocardial perfusion. 2. Increased left 
ventricular cavity size. Severe systolic dysfunction with global 
hypokinesis.

ventricular wall thickness with a normal cavity size. There is 
moderate global left ventricular hypokinesis. Overall left 
ventricular systolic function is moderately depressed. 
Quantitative 3Dvolumetric left ventricular ejection fraction is 
37% (normal 54-73%). Left ventricular cardiac index is normal 
(>2.5 L/min/m2). There is no resting left ventricular outflow 
tract gradient. No ventricular septal defect is seen. Normal 
right ventricular cavity size with normal free wall motion. 
There is abnormal septal motion c/w conduction abnormality/paced 
rhythm. The aortic sinus diameter is normal for gender with a 
normal ascending aorta diameter for gender. The aortic arch 
diameter is normal with a normal descending aorta diameter. 
There is no evidence for an aortic arch coarctation. The aortic 
valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. There is no aortic 
valve stenosis. There is mild [1+] aortic regurgitation. The 
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened with no mitral valve 
prolapse. There is mild[1+] mitral regurgitation. The pulmonic 
valve leaflets are normal. The tricuspid valve leaflets appear 
structurally normal. There is mild [1+] tricuspid regurgitation. 
The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. 
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Normal left ventricular wall thickness and cavity 
size with moderate global systolic function in the setting of 
visual dyssynchrony. Normal RV size and function. Mild mitral, 
tricuspid, and aortic regurgitation. Normal estimated PASP.

Cardiac catheterization ___

The coronary circulation is right dominant.
LM: The Left Main, arising from the left cusp, is a large 
caliber vessel and is short. This vessel bifurcates into the 
Left Anterior Descending and Left Circumflex systems.
LAD: The Left Anterior Descending artery, which arises from the 
LM, is a large caliber vessel. There is a 20% stenosis in the 
proximal segment. The Diagonal, arising from the proximal 
segment, is a medium caliber vessel.
Cx: The Circumflex artery, which arises from the LM, is a large 
caliber vessel. The ___ Obtuse Marginal, arising from the 
proximal segment, is a medium caliber vessel. The ___ Obtuse 
Marginal, arising from the mid segment, is a medium caliber 
vessel.
RCA: The Right Coronary Artery, arising from the right cusp, is 
a large caliber vessel. The Right Posterior Descending Artery, 
arising from the distal segment, is a medium caliber vessel. The 
Right Posterolateral Artery, arising from the distal segment, is 
a medium caliber vessel.
IMPRESSION:
• Normal left filling pressures.
• No significant angiographically apparent coronary artery 
disease.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ is a ___ year-old woman with no known cardiac 
history presenting with acute onset substernal left-sided chest 
pain radiating to left shoulder and into her neck with 
associated shortness of breath and new LBBB on EKG concerning 
for biomarker unstable angina. Her pain improved with 
nitroglycerin and she was treated with nitroglycerin and heparin 
infusions, along with ASA. Troponin-T negative x3. Her chronic 
migraines are associated with some chest pain, though patient 
noted the pain this episode is different in nature than her 
migraine associated chest pain. Vasodilator nuclear stress test 
showed uniform perfusion, but increased left ventricular cavity 
size with global hypokinesis and LVEF 27%. Echocardiogram showed 
LVER 37% with moderate global systolic dysfunction. Cardiac 
catheterization on ___ showed normal LVEDP of 12 mm Hg 
(NT-Pro-BNP 275) and no angiographically apparent flow-limiting 
coronary artery disease. Thus, the etiology of her reduced LVEF 
is likely non-ischemic, especially acute on chronic stress 
induced cardiomyopathy (Takotsubo's) given extensive history of 
psychological stressors and PTSD. Of note, normal iron studies, 
normal TSH and HIV negative. Other unlikely causes of 
non-ischemic cardiomyopathy including carnitine deficiency, 
thiamine deficiency were evaluated with negative blood test. 
SPEP ultimately returned normal. She was discharged on new 
cardiac guideline-directed medications including lisinopril and 
metoprolol succinate. She was hemodynamically stable for 
discharge and was monitored closely for any allergic reaction to 
her medications prior to discharge (given extensive allergy 
list).

CHRONIC ISSUES
# Hypothyroidism: Per endocrine notes, patient euthyroid with 
negative antibodies but for a long time has felt better on 
levothyroxine. She was continued on home levothyroxine 50 mcg 
daily

# Fibromyalgia, OsteoarthritisL Continued home tramadol 50 mg 
TID PRN and home gabapentin

# Depression, PTSD: Continued home lamotrigine and clonazepam; 
held home prazosin

# GERD: Continued home omeprazole 40 mg daily

# Bronchiectasis with recurrent bronchitis, asthma: Continued 
home fluticasone, Incruse inhalers

# Chronic migraine headaches

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
New NICM, HFrEF:
