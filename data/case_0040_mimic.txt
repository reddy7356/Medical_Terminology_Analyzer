left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular 
systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular 
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. There are simple 
atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta and aortic arch. The 
aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good 
leaflet excursion and ___ aortic stenosis or aortic 
regurgitation. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with 
trivial mitral regurgitation. There is ___ pericardial effusion.

Final Report:   
In comparison with the study of ___, there is little 
change in the 
appearance of the right subclavian pacer device with leads 
extending to the right atrium and apex of the right ventricle.  
The patient has taken a better inspiration.  Increased 
opacification at the left base with silhouetting hemidiaphragm 
is consistent with pleural fluid and compressive atelectasis. 
___ evidence of post procedure pneumothorax.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. ___ was transferred from outside hospital after 
cardiac cath revealed severe three-vessel coronary artery 
disease. Upon admission she underwent surgical work-up while 
receiving medical management. Of note she had one episode of 
syncope that was associated with bradycardia with a rate that 
went to the 20's, this was thought to be due to beta blockade 
and her Beta blocker was discontinued. On ___ she was brought 
to the operating Coronary artery bypass grafting x4 with the 
left internal mammary artery to the left anterior descending 
artery and reverse saphenous vein graft to the posterior 
descending artery, obtuse marginal artery and the diagonal 
artery. The Cross-clamp time was 59 minutes. Cardiopulmonary 
Bypass time was 71 minutes. Following surgery she was 
transferred to the CVICU for invasive monitoring in stable 
condition. Later this day she was weaned from sedation, awoke 
neurologically intact and extubated. The patient was 
neurologically intact and hemodynamically stable, weaned from 
inotropic and vasopressor support. Beta blocker was initiated 
and she was gently diuresed toward the preoperative weight. She 
was transferred to the telemetry floor for further recovery. 
Chest tubes and pacing wires were discontinued without 
complication. Her blood sugars were well controlled on her home 
regimen. She was evaluated by the physical therapy service for 
assistance with strength and mobility.

On ___, while walking with an nursing assistant she reported 
feeling unsteady and sweat. She slumped to the floor and was 
noted to have bradycardia (HR ___ and apnea requiring bag-mask 
ventiliation for ___ minutes. There was ___ shaking or tremors 
involving her extremities, ___ incontinence, ___ tongue biting, 
and ___ post-ictal period.  Once she was hemodynamically 
stabilized, she was at her baseline mental status. Neurology was 
consulted to assess for possible seizure versus syncope. Given 
her symptoms it was felt to be a vasovagal episode. Cardiology 
was also consulted and given her repeated pre-hospital and 
hospital episodes of bradycardia with syncope, a pacer was 
recommended and was placed on ___ without incident.  By the 
time of discharge on POD 7 she was ambulating with assistance, 
the wound was healing and pain was controlled with oral 
analgesics. She was discharged to rehabilitation at ___ 
___ in good condition with appropriate follow up 
instructions.
