History of Present Illness:
___ is a ___ year old woman with diabetes, peripheral 
vascular disease, Alzheimer disease, history of provoked DVT/PE 
w filter and AC, and history of upper GI bleed who presents to 
the ED with fever, cough, and vomiting. She was last at ___ in 
___. The patient was recently at ___ for a right tib/fib 
fracture with ORIF. She was discharged to ___ and had 
been clinically about the same until the past couple days when 
she developed vomiting. Nutrition had been an issue even before 
her last hospitalization, but since yesterday she has vomited 
several times which is new for her. ___ also recorded a 
fever of ___ F. She remains oriented to person, place, and month 
(baseline) but had not reported any other symptoms to ___ 
___. Staff there reported coughing, but the patient's daughter 
had not noticed any when she visited. 

In the ED VS were WNL, but she was found to have a leukocytosis 
to 15 and ___ with Cr of 1.8. She received 1 L NS. U/A with 
bacteria and WBCs but lots of epis (she was treated with 3 days 
of ceftriaxone for E. coli last admission). CXR without a clear 
infectious process.

On arrival to the floor, however, we discovered after removing 
her RLE brace and dressing that purulent fluid is draining from 
the ORIF incision. She also has what appears to be a pressure 
wound on the lateral RLE from the brace. Pus was expressed from 
the incision and sent for culture.

ROS: Unable to obtain accurate ROS secondary to dementia 
(patient seemed to be answer with "yes" for every question). She 
winced with pain when manipulating her leg, however.

IMAGING:
=======
CXR ___
There is tortuosity of the thoracic aorta, stable.  There has 
been improvement
of the subsegmental atelectasis within the mid lung zones 
bilaterally.  No
large pleural effusions, overt pulmonary edema, or 
pneumothoraces are seen.

U/S SOFT TISSUE ___
No evidence for organized collection.  Edema and swelling only.

TIB/FIB AP LATERAL ___ 
No evidence of bony lysis or periosteal reaction.

KNEE AP LAT OBLIQUE ___
No evidence for lysis or joint effusion.  Soft tissue swelling 
above the patella.

TTE ___
IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. No 2D echocardiographic 
evidence for endocarditis.
The aortic valve is slightly suspicious however. It is thickened 
and also has mild AI. The image quality is not sufficient to 
considerably reduce the probability of endocarditis in this 
patient with high pretest probability.
Compared with the prior TTE (images reviewed) of ___ , 
the findings are similar. The aortic valve structure is similar 
reducing making visualized changes more likely to be age related 
rather then due to a small vegetation.

CXR ___
The tip of the right PICC line projects over the cavoatrial 
junction.

CXR ___
Improved right pleural effusion.  Persistent small left pleural 
effusion and stable, significant left lower lobe collapse.

CXR ___
Lungs are low volume with moderate cardiomegaly.  The widened 
cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable.  Bilateral effusions 
right greater than left are unchanged.  No pneumothorax is seen. 
 Small bilateral effusions are stable.

[] Please have patient follow up with Dr. ___ in clinic 
in ___ weeks for wound check. Call ___ if not heard 
back about an appointment. 

[] Follow up blood sugars qachs at ___, consider restarting 
insulin NPH or sliding scale at low dose if BG elevated (was 
being downtitrated in hospital given poor PO intake, on 3U NPH

___ or to the on-call ID fellow when the clinic is 
closed. 

[] Discharged on warfarin 1mg daily, stable on this regimen. 
Recommend checking INR ___ and adjusting dose accordingly

[] Monitor weights and volume status and consider restarting 
home torsemide if gaining weight/become fluid overloaded on exam 
(stopped at discharge as she remained euvolemic and did not 
require torsemide, likely due to poor PO intake)

ACUTE ISSUES:
=============
#Tib/fib incisional MRSA/VSE infection, septic arthritis
Patient presented to the ED with fever, cough, and vomiting, 
found to have infection from tib/fib incision draining pus, 
taken to OR ___ for I&D and wound vac placement with orthopedics 
and briefly on ortho service. Wound cultures grew MSRA and VSE. 
She went back to the O.R. ___ for right tibial I&D and hardware 
explant. Plastic surgery was consulted given poor wound 
coverage. She returned to the O.R. for right knee septic 
arthritis washout, tibia I&D, negative pressure wound therapy 
with instillation ___, and lastly a washout ___ with 
orthopedics which looked clean. Her final surgery was a gastroc 
flap and skin graft using L thigh tissue ___ with plastic 
surgery. She had 5 days of bedrest while the wound vac was in 
place. This was removed ___. Pain control was achieved with 
Acetaminophen, home Fentanyl patch, and gabapentin. She will be 
unable to ambulate on the RLE given hardware removal. She 
remained in a knee immobilizer with plans to be wheelchair 
bound. Initial discussion with orthopedics and family had been 
for hardware replacement after completion of antibiotics but 
patient preferred to not have another surgery (see below).

#High grade MRSA bacteremia
Blood cultures ___ were 
positive for MRSA and subsequently had no growth. ID was 
consulted. TTE did not show definite endocarditis but there was 
thickening on the aortic valve. TEE was not pursued because it 
would not change her management. Vancomycin was started, D1 
considered ___, the day of the last washout, projected end date 
___. RUE PICC was placed ___. Vancomycin dosing remained 
stable at 1g Q24H. She will need weekly Vancomycin trough, CRP, 
CBC/diff, BUN/Cr and ID followup.

#Likely psuedomonas wound infection 
Developed ___ film and prurulence over RLE wound and LLE donor 
site. Due to high clinical concern for pseudomonas, was started 
on cefepime (___). ID and plastics were consulted and she is 
s/p debridement with plan for continuing cefepime until ___.

# GOC
# Severe Malnutrition 
# Aspiration risk
Multiple goals of care discussions and family meetings were held 
to clarify patient's wishes in the setting of her prolonged 
hospitalization and severe malnutrition, anorexia, poor PO 
intake, electrolyte abnormalities. Dobhoff was placed ___ for 
temporary supplemental nutrition. Patient pulled the Dobhoff out 
___ and ultimately family and patient made the decision not to 
replace any feeding tubes, though replacement of temporary 
feeding tube and PEG tube placement were considered. Geriatrics 
was consulted to help clarify GOC. Patient stated that she would 
not want to have a PEG tube or to undergo another surgery with 
orthopedics and would be okay with being in a wheelchair. Plan 
for discharge to ___ to complete antibiotics. Mirtazapine was 
uptitrated to assist with appetite. Code status discussion on 
___:

"Met with son and HCP, ___ to discuss overall goals and to sign
MOLST form prior to discharge to ___ in the coming days.
Reviewed with ___ what we had discussed earlier and also with
patient's niece, ___: that she was taking in very little food
and fluid. This poor intake was due to her dementia and was
irreversible. Said that amount of food she was taking in would
not sustain her for long, and would lead to decreased wound
healing, kidney injury, low blood pressure, eventually likely 
her
death. Confirmed that ___ did not feel the patient wanted a PEG
tube, he again confirmed very clearly she did not want a feeding
tube and all family members in agreement. He understood that
without this the patient would continue to decline, likely over
weeks. He understood, and said, yes, when it is her time it is
her time. 

Then brought up code status, and reviewed MOLST. I had brought
this up earlier and he and ___ were going to talk about it. 
He
said they had discussed and they would "like to resuscitate 
her."
I reviewed what CPR and intubation meant. I said that in her
condition, which is progressive, I did not think she would
benefit from these measures if something so catastrophic 
happened
that required these measures. I reviewed that she has limited
time left, and if something catastrophic happened like this, and
we were successful in reviving her, it might mean she would 
spend
the lsat days of her life in the ICU on machines. He understood
this, but said he thought she would still like to try this, and
then make the decision to withdraw at that time. 

Based on this discussion kept code status "full code." MOLST 
form
signed with CPR, intubation, but NO artificial nutrition."

#Leukocytosis
Patient had intermittent leukocytosis which peaked at 19.8 
shortly after admission, then reoccurred in the setting of 
multiple surgeries. She had repeat infectious workup which was 
unrevealing. Resolved at time of discharge.

#Multiple pressure ulcers 
Patient had multiple unstageable coccyx ulcers present on 
admission, developed bilateral left and right posterior heel 
ulcers which were followed by wound nursing. Right ankle wound 
was debrided to fascia by plastic surgery. Due to inadequate 
nutrition (see above) and bed bound status. She has multiple 
risk factors for poor wound healing and these should be 
monitored closely. 

#Hypoxia
Patient had intermittent hypoxia early in the hospital course 
which improved with IV Lasix, suspect combination of fluid 
overload atelectasis.

#Loose Stool
Started in close proximity to starting tube feeds and standing 
miralax. C diff was negative.

___
Creatinine was 1.8 on admission, thought prerenal from poor PO 
intake and sepsis. Diuretics were held and she improved to 
baseline around 0.4-0.5 She had one minor ___ after receiving 
multiple doses of IV Lasix. Renal function was stable 
subsequently.

___ UTI: 
UA positive on admission, started ceftriaxone, switched to 
cefepime (D1 = ___, 7d course, last day
___.

#Hypernatremia 
Sodium peaked at 153 soon after admission, likely decreased PO 
intake. Improved with D5W and tube feeds.

#Anasarca 
She became total body fluid overloaded due to poor nutrition as 
above. Albumin <2 last check despite
getting TFs. Also was on mIVF previously. Diuresis was limited 
by fluctuations in electrolytes.

#Acute on Chronic Normocytic Anemia, stable
Hb baseline around 9, no prior iron studies, suspect AoCI. 
Worsened from multiple surgeries, acute illness, and frequent 
phlebotomy. She received 3 blood transfusions this 
hospitalization, most recent ___.

#Acute Pulmonary Embolism:
#Left Femoral Common Vein DVT:
Presented with supratherapeutic INR in setting of recently 
increased warfarin dosing from 2 mg to 3 mg on ___ at rehab. She 
received 5 mg IV Vitamin K on ___ and anticoagulation was then 
held. She initially required a heparin drip for bridging back to 
warfarin given ___, then remained therapeutic for days without 
any anticoagulation, likely ___ poor nutrition as above. She 
then had a lovenox bridge back to warfarin. She had IVF filter 
placed on previous hospitalization which per ___ (does not want 
further invasive procedures) will not be removed. Due to rising 
INR, prior to discharge her warfarin was decreased to 1mg daily 
(was held 2 days prior to discharge), likely due to poor 
nutrition. 
 
#Family Communication
Prior difficulties with niece ___ yelling at staff early in 
hospitalization, subsequently not a problem with improved 
communication. Son ___ is primary HCP with ___ as the 
alternatie but they share decision making. SW was consulted for 
family coping.

#HTN
Initially held home Hydralazine, Lisinopril, Nifedipine to 
decrease pill burden and as patient was not taking PO well. 
Resumed home Hydralazine when patient was able, and then added 
amlodipine.

#Chronic Diastolic CHF: 
Held home Torsemide 5 mg daily to reduce pill burden and 
initially for ___. Received PRN IV Lasix 20 mg. It was difficult 
to get accurate weights due to immobility and difficult to 
obtain accurate output due to incontinence. Torsemide held on 
discharge with poor intake. 

#Rectal prolapse 
Patient has history of rectal prolapse, reduced last 
hospitalization by colorectal surgery. Had spontaneous prolapse 
and resolution once this hospitalization. Colorectal was 
consulted but it had resolved by the time of their assessment. 
No concern for ischemia and patient seemed asymptomatic.

CHRONIC ISSUES:
===============
#DM
Last admission staff spoke with PCP who reported she is a 
brittle diabetic and her diabetic regimen has been liberalized 
to avoid hypoglycemia at the expense of tight control. She was 
continued on home NPH 10 initially, decreased to 5u QAM after 
feeding tube was removed, maintained ISS, and held trulicity and 
metformin. Avoided lantus per PCP due to hypoglycemia. Insulin 
was downtitrated to 3U given decreased PO intake and 
hypoglycemia and stopped at discharge (patient to go back on 
home metformin).

#Dementia: 
Continued Donepezil, delirium precautions, ramelteon HS. Started 
and uptitrated Mirtazapine.

#Chronic back pain: Continued home fentanyl patch, gabapentin, 
Tylenol

#PVD: Continued statin, ASA

#GERD: Continued Pantoprazole, briefly IV when patient was not 
taking PO

Greater than 30minutes spent on discharge planning and

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,

You came back to the hospital because of an infection growing 
from the place where you had surgery to fix your broken leg. The 
infection affected your whole body and made you very sick. 

While you were in the hospital you had cultures of your 
infection and your blood that grew a bacteria called MRSA 
(Staph) and you are receiving antibiotics called Vancomycin for 
this.

You also had a number of surgeries to clean out the infection 
and take away the infected metal and replace muscle over the 
infected area to help it heal. You will not be able to walk on 
your leg because of this. Your wound also developed some 
drainage consistent with an infection called pseudomonas. You 
are receiving an antibiotic called Cefepime for this.

Your nutrition suffered a lot and you had a feeding tube placed 
to help you heal. After some discussion, it was decided that you 
would not want to live with a permanent feeding tube, so we 
stopped doing this and let you eat whenever you want.

When you leave the hospital, please:
- See below for your medicines and followup

It was an absolute pleasure caring for you and we wish you the 
best,
Your ___ Team

History of Present Illness:
___ is a ___ year old woman with diabetes, peripheral
vascular disease, Alzheimer's, history of provoked DVT, history
of upper GI bleed, who was transferred to the ___ ED from
___ after sustaining a fall with tib/fib fracture.

The history was obtained from the patient's family and records,

reportedly been in her usual state of health yesterday evening.
her son ___ visited her in the evening, and she did not seem to
have any new symptoms or difficulty ambulating with her walker.
She reportedly did all her normal activities during the day. 
Around 11 ___ she had a fall and pulled her alarm. She lives at 
an
assisted living in ___. Her family suspects that the 
socks
she was wearing were slippery, leading to a mechanical fall,
although this is uncertain. She has had two other falls in the
recent past. She was brought to ___, where she
underwent a trauma evaluation that revealed a proximal tib/fib
fracture (see full details of work-up below). While in the
___ she was reportedly satting 92% on room air, which 
is
her baseline, with a normal appearing CXR. She did received a 
500

evaluation. 

In the ___ ED vitals were: afebrile, HR ___, BP
110s-210s/50s-110s, RR ___, satting 95-100% on RA-2L. Labs 
were

normal lytes, and pyuria. She was noted to have wheezing and
reportedly satting 87% on 1 L, requiring 2L to maintain sats in
___. She was evaluated by trauma surgery and orthopedics in the

shoulder
pain. While in the ED she reportedly have a brief, 
self-resolving
episode of tachycardia to 130s, possibly afib, for which she
received 5 mg IV metoprolol. Her CXR appeared wet, and he also
received duonebs, Lasix 20 mg, Tylenol, morphine, and sublingual
NTG. Orthopedic placed a splint to her R leg but decided to hold
off on surgery given the hypoxia and concern for CHF. 

I interviewed the patient and her family upon arrival to the
floor. The patient endorsed dyspnea, although the family stated
that she appeared to be at her baseline and that she had not
seemed dyspneic at any time leading up to her presentation or
since her presentation that they perceived. The patient stated
that she had pain "all over", but particularly in the left
shoulder, back, and right leg. She states overall it was
improving. She denied chest or abdominal pain. She denied
dysuria. 

I reviewed the case with ___, the patient's PCP, 
who
states that the patient has no history of CHF.

IMAGING
CXR ___ IMPRESSION:  Moderate cardiomegaly with increase in 
moderate pulmonary edema and small bilateral pleural effusions.

TTE ___
IMPRESSION: Biatrial enlargement. Moderate LVH with small, 
underfilled LV cavity. Normal LV function. Moderately dilated RV 
with severe RV dysfunction. Severe TR and severe pulmonary HTN.
Mild AR. Mildly dilated aorta.

CTA ___ IMPRESSION: 
1.   Subsegmental pulmonary embolism the right upper lobe apical 
branch.
2.   Enlarged main, right and left pulmonary arteries consistent 
with history of pulmonary artery hypertension.  No evidence of 
right heart strain. 3.   Pulmonary edema and moderate bilateral 
pleural effusions.

- KNEE XR ___: 
1. Stable comminuted, displaced, and moderately impacted 
bicondylar tibial plateau fracture, Schatzker class 6, in 
unchanged alignment. 2. Comminuted, mildly impacted proximal 
fibular head and neck fracture is better evaluated on recent CT 
lower extremity, however appears grossly unchanged. 3. Stable 
large lipohemarthrosis 

- LENIS ___: Left common femoral vein deep venous thrombosis.

- V/Q SCAN ___: 1. Patchy bilateral ventilation defects are 
consistent with airway disease. Notably, there is a significant 
defect in the left lower lobe which could represent a mucous 
plug.  2. Perfusion defect in the right upper lobe may represent 
prior documented subsegmental PE.  There are no additional V/Q 
mismatch to suggest additional PE. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ is a ___ hx IDDM2, PVD, Alzheimer's, provoked 
DVT, transferred from ___ after mechanical fall with tib/fib 
fracture with hypoxia, found to have PE, DVT, chronic dCHF, and 
RV failure.

# Proximal RLE tibial platuea fracture: 
Transferred from CHA with fracture in setting of fall. 
Originally seen by ortho and placed in cast. Given medical 
issues below, required extensive pre-operative evaluation for 
___, PE, DVT, RV failure and was ultimately deemed a high risk 
candidate by cardiology and medicine. Underwent tibial plateau 
fracture ORIF on ___ with regional blocks and MAC in place of 
general anesthesia and tolerated the procedure well without need 
for intubation. There were no complications and she improved in 
the post-operative period.  She is touch down weight bearing 
(TDWB) in the right lower extremity in an unlocked ___. ___ 
evaluated her and recommended discharge to rehab. 

# Acute Hypoxic Respiratory Failure
# Acute Pulmonary Embolism:
# Left Femoral Common Vein DVT:
# Acute on Chronic Diastolic CHF: 
Patient was hypoxic on transfer from OSH. CTA performed and 
demonstrated a small distal PE in RUL and she was subsequently 
started on a heparin gtt. ___ demonstrated a large left common 
femoral vein DVT. Echocardiogram demonstrated high PASP/pHTN out 
of proportion to PE size, with RV free wall dilation and 
hypokinesis. She was diuresed for acute on chronic diastolic 
CHF. Given high-risk cardiac morbidities, evaluated by 
cardiology pre-op.  Cardiology recommended V/Q scan to evaluate 
between chronic left sided dCHF or CTEPH as cause of pulmonary 
HTN - test favored the former. An IVC filter was placed to 
reduce embolism of high risk DVT while off anticoagulation for 
surgery. Post-operatively, she was transitioned from heparin to 
Rivaroxaban.  She developed a small amount of rectal bleeding 
while on Rivaroxaban so was subsequently switched to Coumadin 
for improved control and option of reversal.  As this DVT/PE was 
likely provoked in the setting of fracture, she will require at 
least 3 months of anticoagulation.

# Acute on Chronic Diastolic CHF: 
As above, TTE with LVH, normal LV function, moderately dilated 
RV with severe RV
global free wall hypokinesis. Severe TR and severe pulm HTN 
(PASP 61), Mild AR. RV pressures and hypokinesis out of 
proportion to PE size, and as V/Q scan without other significant 
perfusions defects, suspect elevated PASP is due to chronic left 
sided failure. She was initially treated with iv Lasix and then 
transitioned to home torsemide.

# Rectal bleeding 
# Rectal Prolapse
Small blood clots seen per rectum on ___. Hemoglobin 
remained stable.  She has a known history of rectal prolapse. 
Colorectal surgery was called to evaluate and reduce rectal 
prolapse.  They recommended an adequate bowel regimen to ensure 
soft BMs.  The bleeding per rectum was small and thus, 
anticoagulation was not stopped.  Colorectal Surgery did not 
feel any surgical intervention was warranted at this time.

# HTN: Persistently elevated this admission. Continued home 
losartan and home hydralazine. She was started on nifedipine 
which was titrated to 60 mg daily and her hydralazine was 
titrated down to 10 mg TID. Plan to taper hydralazine as able.

# IDDM2: ___ prior MD discussion with her PCP she is ___ brittle 
diabetic and her diabetic regimen had been liberalized to avoid 
hypoglycemia at the expense of tight control. She was thus kept 
on a liberal sliding scale while hospitalized with most FSBS in 
the 200s. While hospitalized home NPH, trulicity, and metformin 
were held.

# Demand Ischemia
# Type 2 MI: On admission patient had mild troponin leak in 
setting of tachycardia, PE, and acute on chronic diastolic CHF. 
Troponins peaked to 0.10 --> 0.07. EKG without clear ischemic 
changes. Continued on aspirin, statin, and blood pressure agents 
as anove. 

# Asymptomatic Bacteruria: Unclear if patient had urinary 
symptoms on admission. UCX with E. Coli s/p 3 days CTX 
___. IUC removed without issue. 

# PVD: continued statin, ASA

# Alzheimer's dementia: Maintained on delirium precautions. Home 
donepezil continued.

# Chronic pain: continued home fentanyl patch, Tylenol, and 
gabapentin. Additional pain meds given as needed

History of Present Illness:
The patient is an ___ year old female with multiple medical 
problems including diabetes, dementia, peripheral vascular 
disease who presented to ___ on ___ with 
coffee ground emesis and melana. 
.
Regarding the GI bleed, she was found to have a hematocrit of 20 
(on ___ was 41). She had an EGD on ___ that showed duodenal 
erosion with stigmata of recent bleeding but no active bleeding. 
Biopsy revealed active chronic gastritis but negative for H. 
pylori. However, she had an episode of hematemesis with 
hematocrit drop to 19 to repeat EGD done on ___. This showed 
adherent blood and inflammation throughout the stomach. A single 
25mm pedunculated polyp with no bleeding was found in the ___ 
part of the duodenum/proximal jejunum out of reach to be 
resected. On ___ she had "fresh blood per rectum" and so a 
tagged RBC scan was obtained but was unremarkable. On ___ 
patient had a melanotic stool so transfer to ___ for push 
enteroscopy was pursued. Since that time her hematocrit has 
remained stable ~27. She has been switched to PO PPI BID and a 
mechanical soft diet. She has received a total of 9 units of 
blood. 
.
Her hospital course was complicated by right axillary DVT 
provoked by PICC placement. The PICC was removed and since then 
RUE pain ansd swelling have significantly decreased. She 
reported bilateral lower extremity swelling and pain so 
bilatearl lower extremity U/S was obtained that demosntrated 
right popliteal and gastrocnemius vein DVT.  Vascular surgery 
was consulted recommended obtaining hematology c/s given 
multiple clots raising possibility for underlying 
hypercoagulable disorder.  Hematology was consulted - "little 
suggestion of occult malignancy or heriditary cause for 
thrombophilia and these episodes have been provoked." No IVC 
filter was placed. No systemic anticoagulation was started. 
.
She currently denies chest pain, dyspnea, dizziness. She 
endorses right lower extremity pain over the past several days. 
She endorses more long-standing left lower extremity pain. 
.

Pathology:
PATHOLOGIC DIAGNOSIS:

Antral fold biopsy:

a. Chronic inactive gastritis.

b. Immunostains for H. pylori are negative.
.
EGD
Impression: Diverticulum in the third part of the duodenum
Polyp in the fourth part of the duodenum, not biopsied in the 
setting of recent reported bleeding
Two lymphangectasias were noted in the third portion of the 
duodenum
Thickened antral fold with superficial erosions in the 
pre-pyloric region (biopsy)
Otherwise normal EGD to mid jejunum 
Recommendations: No evidence of active bleeding. 
Await pathology results. 
Recommend colonoscopy to determine source of melena if 
consistent with patients goals of care.
 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
