on ___ who presented with shortness of breath and 
lightheadedness and found to be in atrial flutter/afib with RVR. 
 

# Atrial Flutter/Fibrillation with RVR: Likely in the setting of 
coming off of amiodarone. Before cardioversion he was in 
Aflutter with 2:1 and 3:1 block. He was cardioverted to NSR, and 
his amiodarone was restarted at 400mg daily. This dose should be 
continued for 1 month before going back to 200mg daily. If his 
Aflutter recurs, consultation with EP regarding ablation should 
be considered. Continued home metoprolol XL 50 and coumadin with 
INR goal 2.5-3.   

# Shortness of breath: His shortness of breath resolved after 
cardioversion and 2L of diuresis after 20 iv lasix x 1. Was most 
likely CHF exacerbation in the setting of atrial flutter/afib 
with RVR.  

# ___: Resolved. Baseline Cr of 1; 1.5 on admission, now back to 
1.0 after diuresis. Was likely cardiorenal syndrome in the 
setting of CHF. Held home losartan on admission and restarted at 
discharge.
