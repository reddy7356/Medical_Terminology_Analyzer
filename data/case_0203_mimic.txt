IMAGING
-------
CT ABD/PELVIS:  
IMPRESSION: 
  
1. There is no acute abnormality visualized within the imaged 
portion of the abdomen and pelvis. 
2. Post surgical changes related to bladder and prostate removal 
and 
ureterostomy are noted.  Left-sided moderate 
hydroureteronephrosis, the acuity of which is uncertain in this 
postoperative state.  No asymmetric perinephric stranding or 
adjacent fluid collection.  No obstructing renal calculus. 
3. Lucent lesion within the L4 vertebral body which is possibly 
but not 
definitively a hemangioma.  Correlation with prior imaging 
presumed performed elsewhere suggested otherwise MRI on a 
nonurgent basis would be suggested. 
4. Abnormal left pelvic sidewall soft tissue, potentially an 
metastatic lymph node.  Additional borderline enlarged right 
common iliac lymph node to be correlated with prior imaging.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ is a ___ gentleman with a history of 
metastatic recurrent bladder cancer s/p cystectomy and ileal 
conduit on cycle 1 of pembrolizumab who presents with fever and 
body aches.

# Fever: Unclear cause. Originally thought possibly UTI given 
history of recurrent UTIs but urine cultures negative. No 
localizing symptoms of infection. He was started on meropenem 
and had no further fevers. ID was consulted. He had a CT torso 
which did not show any definite source of infection except noted 
for necrotic lymph node. Discussed with ID and ___ who 
felt most likely lymph node was not infected/abscess. Felt 
fevers may be due to pembrolizumab. Meropenem was discontinued 
and he was monitored for 24-hour without further fevers. ID 
recommended if further fever at home without red flag symptoms, 
patient should be evaluated in outpatient clinic with infectious 
work-up to avoid repeated ED visits/hospitalizations. He will 
continued weekly fosfomycin for continued UTI suppression.

# Shoulder Pain/MSK Pain: Possibly biceps tendonitis. Possibly 
due to pembrolizumab. Cardiac work-up negative. Shoulder x-rays 
unremarkable. CT without evidence of bone metastasis. OT 
consulted, recommending outpatient OT. Could also consider 
steroids if worsening symptoms.

# Cancer-Related Pain: Currently well controlled on regimen. 
Continued home oxycontin and oxycodone with bowel regimen.

# Hypertension/Hyperlipidemia: Continued amlodipine. Lisinopril 
on hold per PCP. Continued aspirin and atorvastatin.

# CKD stage III: At baseline. 

# Metastatic Bladder Cancer: On pembrolizumab and radiation 
therapy. Follow-up with outpatient Oncologist.

# DM: Continued home lantus. Held glipizide during 
hospitalization and restarted at time of discharge.

# Anemia: Likely multifactorial. No evidence of bleeding. Counts 
stable.

====================
Transitional Issues:
====================
- Patient with fever without clear source. Consider aspiration 
of necrotic lymph node to evaluate for infection if continued 
issues with fever. Also would recommend outpatient work-up of 
future fevers if no red flag symptoms to avoid repeated ED 
visits/hospitalizations.
- Please follow-up pending blood cultures from ___ and 
___.
- Patient provided with 1 month supply of oxycontin at 
discharge.
- Please provide outpatient OT to progress left shoulder range 
of motion.
- Please ensure follow-up with Oncology.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,

It was a pleasure taking care of you at the ___ 
___. You were admitted with fever and 
muscle/joint pain.

You were evaluated extensively for the cause of the fever. You 
had multiple cultures and imaging studies. You were seen by the 
Infectious Disease team as well. You were on antibiotics while 
in the hospital however there was no definitive source of 
infection so the antibiotics were discontinued. The imaging did 
not show any source of infection but did note a necrotic lymph 
node however after discussion with the Radiologists and 
Infectious Disease doctors it was ___ that this was likely not 
infected. You continued to feel well and were discharged off of 
antibiotics. You will continue to take your weekly fosfomycin 
for prevent further urinary infections. It is possible your 
fevers were caused by your immunotherapy.

We hope to avoid further Emergency Room visits and 
hospitalizations due to your fever. Please call your Oncologist 
if you have further fevers. The hope is that you can be 
evaluated for infection in clinic instead of going to the ER 
initially. However if you have "red flag" symptoms you should go 
to the ER urgently after alerting your Oncologist. These include 
high-grade fever (temp > 102), persistent/multiple fevers, 
shortness of breath/cough, severe abdominal pain, diarrhea, and 
changes in urine output (cloudy, foul smelling, bloody).

You muscle/joint pain was likely due to your immunotherapy. You 
had x-rays of your shoulders that were negative. Please continue 
to take your pain medications. If your muscle and joint pain 
worsens please call your Oncologist as they may increase your 
pain medication or start you on steroids.

Please continue the rest of your home medications. Please 
follow-up with your doctors as below.

All the best,
Your ___ Team

ileal conduit for bladder carcinoma, now w/ pelvic and thoracic 
recurrence (C2D5 Gemcitabine/CIsplatin, recent XRT to L 
pelvicsidewall), recurrent urosepsis (on fosfomycin suppression) 
p/w fever, now resolved.

# Fever: 
Initially suspected Etiology was most likely urinary in context 
of prior UTIs, absence of other localizing symptoms, although no 
leukocytosis and appeared well. Has significant hx of MDR 
organisms, last E.coli treated with meropenem/ertapenem. Of 
note, he recently initiated weekly suppressive fosfomycin, last 
dose on the day of admission. On admission he was started on 
meropenem empirically prior microbiology. He remained afebrile 
while hospitalized. Urine cultures were negative. Blood cultures 
negative to date. No fever or WBC noted in the hospital. ID was 
consulted for assistance with antibiotic management given 
negative cultures recommended stopping meropenem on ___ and 
monitored for another 36 hours without antibiotics. A follow up 
renal Us showed unchanged left sided hydronephrosis. Per ID he 
could be discharged without any further abx and needs to 
continue suppressive dose of fosphomycin weekly. and He should 
follow up with his outpatient infectious disease specialist, Dr. 
___.

# CKD stage III:
B/l Cr ~1.5. Approximately at baseline on admission after 
fluids. Discharge Cr stable.

# Metastatic Bladder Cancer: He was continued on his home 
oxycontin, oxycodone, and bowel regimen. He will f/u with his 
outpatient oncologist Dr. ___.

# HTN: Home losartan and amlodipine were held on admission in 
setting of concern for infection. But restarted. K is 5.2 on day 
of discharge, recommend checking BMP in a few days to monitor K.

PO intake, and cisplatin injury in the setting of taking ACE-I. 
Has prior history of left-sided hydroureteronephrosis noted on 
abdominal CT from ___ which also showed atrophic right 
kidney. Urine lytes showed FeNa 1.3%. He continued to make good 
urine output and had no indications of hemodialysis. Renal 
ultrasound showed stable left hydronephrosis and no ureter 
strictures or stones for etiology of recurrent UTIs. He was 
given continuous IVF due to poor PO intake. His renal function 
was improving at time of discharge.
