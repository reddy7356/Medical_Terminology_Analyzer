Glucose-84 UreaN-12 Creat-0.8 Na-138 K-3.9 Cl-100 HCO3-___. No PE identified. Extreme lung bases were not imaged. 
2. Moderate bilateral non-hemorrhagic pleural effusions 
associated with basal atelectases. 
3. Spiculated nodule in the left upper lobe not significantly 
changed in size from ___ with bronchial wall thickening and 
peribronchial opacities in the apical posterior segments in LUL 
similar in appearance to prior study. 
4. Spiculated opacity in the right apex also without significant 
change. 
5. Paraseptal and centrilobular emphysema. 
6. Right hilar and subcarinal lymphadenopathy, increased in size 
from 
___.  

Head MRI: There are two ring-enhancing parenchymal lesions. 
There is a 1.8 
cm round lesion in the posterior right temporal lobe, which 
demonstrates 
evidence of chronic blood products on the gradient echo 
sequence. The rim of this lesion also demonstrates slow 
diffusion, which may indicate 
hypercellularity. The nonenhancing ___ the lesion does not 
demonstrate slow diffusion, suggesting that this does not 
represent an abscess. There is moderate vasogenic edema 
involving the right temporal, occipital, and parietal lobes. The 
second ring-enhancing lesion is located in the posterior left 
temporal lobe. It is round, measuring 1.1 cm. There are no 
associated blood products or diffusion abnormalities. There is 
mild associated vasogenic edema. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ yo with metastatic small cell lung cancer who presents with 
change in MS, fever and seizeures who was found to have 
vasogenic edema.
  
# Seizure: Intubated in ED for airway protection. MRI showed two 
previously known metastatic lesions. He was evaluated by 
neurology and started on levetiracetam, dexamethasone, and 
phenytoin. He was also evaluated by radiation oncology. Dilantin 
was tapered off as Keppra was increased, and he is being 
discharged on Keppra and Decadon alone. If his steroids are to 
be continued long-term, he should be started on Ca/Vit 
D/Bisphosphonate/Bactrim. PPI continued at discharge but can be 
discontinued when steroids are stopped. The patient was 
instructed that he should not drive until he has been 
seizure-free for 6 months.

# Fever: Initial concern for aspiration pneumonia vs. ventilator 
associated pneumonia. Multiple chest X-rays showed no evidence 
of infection and antibiotics were stopped. He had no fevers 
while on the general medicine floor.

# Shortness of breath: Patient had an acute episode of shortness 
of breath on ___ after being laid flat for removal of a 
central line. He improved with supportive care alone. Chest CTA 
showed no evidence of emboli or infiltrates, but did show small 
bilateral pleural effusions, likely related to volume 
resuscitation in the ICU. Patient improved and had oxygen 
saturations of 97-99% on room air.

You were admitted with seizures and were initially treated in

medications and had no further witnessed seizures. While on the
