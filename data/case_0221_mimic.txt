CHEST (PA & LAT) Study Date of ___ 11:40 ___:
Findings:  The lungs are well expanded and clear.  Heart size is 
normal.  Mild aortic tortuosity.  Mild reversal of lower 
thoracic kyphosis, with multiple prominent right lateral 
bridging osteophytes.  Mild right acromioclavicular and 
glenohumeral arthropathy. 

MR ___ Contrast: preliminary read: no stroke
 
Brief Hospital Course:
The patient is a ___ year old man who today experienced transient 
memory loss.
Patient initially went to ___ where a ___ 
ruled out hemorragic stroke. He was then transfered to ___ for 
further work up. During his initial interview, he recalls 
certain details but continues to repeatedly make certain
statements ("I missed my metformin dose tonight" and "Can 
someone call my wife to update her?") without memory of having 
made those statements. He was otherwise well recently with no 
other symptoms or illnesses. He had no other neurological signs 
or symptoms. His exam the next day revealed no memory deficit. 
Due to the rapid recovery of his memory we believe he suffered 
from a Transient Global Amnesia and not a stroke. MRI also 
failed to demonstrate any stroke or other acute changes. 

Stroke risk factor labs were drawn at admission and showed an 
A1C of 5.6, and a FLP of TChol 168 ___ 40 HDL 65 LDL 95. 
 
Medications on Admission:
ASA 81
