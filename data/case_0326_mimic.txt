Chief Complaint:
Rapid atrial fibrillation  
 
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
AVJ ablation and single chamber SJM permanent pacemaker 
placement ___
 
History of Present Illness:
___ M history of coronary artery disease, hypertension, chronic 
atrial fibrillation on warfarin, history of cerebrovascular 
accident, chronic kidney disease stage III, initially presented 
to OSH ED ___ after a fall, underwent quadriceps rupture 
repair with his post-operative course complicated by rapid 
atrial fibrillation and pulmonary emboli.

Mr. ___ does not recall the events surrounding his initial 
hospitalization, though his son who is a reliable historian 
provided the account.  The story begins ___ when Mr. 
___ had mechanical fall going up stairs, which he attributes 
to new shoes and tripping.  He reportedly had x-rays of femur 
and ___ knee which were negative for fracture, and there was 
no intervention.  Approximately a week later, he was getting 
into a car when he fell.  He does not recall the 
circumstances/symtpoms surrounding the fall.  His son attributes 
the fall to his bad leg and reports that he was on the ground, 
unresponsive with his eyes open for approximately five minutes.  
He became responsive within five minutes.  EMS was called, and 
VS on their exam was normal and patient was able to go to 
hospital in son's car.  Son reports he was shaking as if he had 
chills on the car ride.  No urinary or bowel incontinence, no 
tongue biting at that time.  Patient does not recall the 
details.

Per OSH documentation, in OSH ED on ___, he was found to have 
rapid a-fib with HR up to 130 (or 180, documentation difficult 
to read).  Troponins negative x 3.  With persistent pain of 
___ knee, he was evaluated by Orthopedic Surgery and underwent 
surgical repair of quadriceps rupture.  Post-operative 
hospitalization was prolonged by atrial fibrillation and 
tachycardia, HR 80 to 120.  Seen by Cardiology, metoprolol was 
titrated and digoxin added.  Resting HR improved to ___, though 
patient became tachycardic with minimal ambulation. (Also of 
note, had pauses on telemetry, rare occasions of pause greater 
than two seconds.)  

INR was subtherapeutic (<2) for four days post-op, so checked 
CTA ___ which showed multiple bilateral segmental pulmonary 
emboli, R>L.  INR at that time 2.3.  Per pulmonology consultant 
at OSH, goal INR 2.5 to 3.0, so he was started on Lovenox bridge 
(apparently with intention to continue Lovenox for ___ days 
regardless of INR, though DC summary slightly difficult to 
interpret).  Also had post-op anemia at OSH, s/p transfusion 
with stable Hct over last few days.

On transfer, VS 98.3  113/77  72  18  99% RA.  He denies 
light-headedness, palpitations, chest pain or dyspnea.  INR from 
OSH indicates INR most recently 2.3.

IMAGING/STUDIES
TTE ___
The left atrium is mildly dilated. The ___ atrium is 
moderately dilated. There is mild symmetric left ventricular 
hypertrophy with normal cavity size. There is mild regional left 
ventricular systolic dysfunction with probable mild basal to mid 
inferior hypokinesis. ___ ventricular chamber size is normal. 
with borderline normal free wall function. The aortic root is 
mildly dilated at the sinus level. There is no aortic valve 
stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve 
leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is 
seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. The 
estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There is 
a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion. There is an anterior 
space which most likely represents a prominent fat pad. 

IMPRESSION: Probable mild hypokinesis of the basal to mid 
inferior segments. Borderline hypokinesis of the ___ 
ventricular. Mild mitral regurgitation.  

CXR ___
Lordotic positioning.  Heart size is borderline.  The aorta is 
mildly 
unfolded.  There is no CHF, frank consolidation, or effusion.  
Some patchy 
opacity in the ___ cardiophrenic region is noted.  This most 
likely 
represents some atelectasis or scarring.  An early pneumonic 
infiltrate is 
considered much less likely, cannot be entirely excluded.  There 
is minimal 
atelectasis at the left base. 

CXR PA/lateral ___
FINDINGS:  New left axillary pacemaker has been placed, with 
single lead
following the expected course and ending at the apex of the 
___ ventricle. 
Lung is well inflated without consolidation. An unexplained 
prevascular
mediastinal contour is projected anteriorly to the ___ lead in 
the lateral
view. A CT is recommended for further characterization. 
There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. 
Cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal except for minimal 
calcification at the
aortic arch.
 
IMPRESSION:  Correct positioning of left axillary pacemaker 
without
pneumothorax. Small opacity in the anterior mediastinum can be 
further
characterized by CT. 
 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ M history of coronary artery disease, hypertension, chronic 
atrial fibrillation on warfarin, history of cerebrovascular 
accident, chronic kidney disease stage III, transferred to ___ 
from outside hospital for further management of atrial 
fibrillation in setting of bilateral pulmonary emboli s/p ___ 
quadriceps rupture surgical repair (surgery ___.
 
ACTIVE DIAGNOSES

# Atrial fibrillation: Pt has h/o chronic atrial fibrillation.  
Had mostly normal heart rates at rest, though bursts of 
tachycardia occurred with minimal exertion.  Was treated with 
metoprolol, titrated to 75mg q 8 hrs due to some pauses on 
telemetry (evident at OSH as well as on telemetry here).  Also 
treated with digoxin 0.125mg daily.  Ability to exert himself 
was limited by tachycardia, which would impair rehab prospects 
s/p quadriceps repair, so he underwent ablation of AV junction 
and placement of single chamber SJM permanent pacemaker ___. 
 After ablation, digoxin was stopped and metoprolol was returned 
to his prior home dose.

Pt was anticoagulated with warfarin as well as Lovenox given 
development of pulmonary emboli while being on warfarin.  DCed 
Lovenox ___.  Continue warfarin with goal INR 2.5 to 3.5.

# Bilateral pulmonary emboli: Patient has been breathing 
comfortably on room air throughout most of admission.  TTE 
showed showed borderline HK of RV, RA mod dilated.  He was 
anticoagulated with warfarin and Lovenox initially given 
possible development of PE while on warfarin alone; Lovenox was 
discontinued ___.  Goal INR after ablation/pacemaker placement 
is 2.5 to 3.5. 

Pt had an episode of acute SOB one morning; ECG was negative for 
ischemic changes.  It resolved with ipratropium nebulizer and 
sitting upright.

# Upper respiratory infection: afebrile, no leukocytosis.  Has 
been having cough productive of yellow sputum and very hoarse 
voice.  Favor viral URI though nasopharyngeal swabs have been 
uninterpretable, and sputum cultures contaminated.  GNRs on 
initial stain concerning for Moraxella, Hemophilus as cause of 
laryngitis, though absence of leukocytosis or fever decreases 
suspicion for bacterial process. No antibiotics were initiated 
this hospitalization.  He was treated symptomatically with 
standing guaifenesin.  Pantoprazole was started in case hoarse 
voice was related to GERD.

# Post-op ___ quadriceps surgical repair ___: Pt without 
pain on admission.  Had orders for Tylenol PRN pain and did not 
require anything stronger.  Spoke with his primary orthopedic 
surgeon's office ___ and was told that staples should 
definitely come out (were supposed to be DCed nine days 
post-op).  Removed staples ___.  Also, brace was apparently 
going to be changed ___ per Nursing's sign-out, though this 
matter may be dealt with at rehab, per orthopedic surgeon's 
office.  

# Anxiety: Home clonazepam was initially changed to PRN, though 
pt did not tend to ask for medication despite anxiety, so it was 
returned to a standing dose.

# Constipation: Advanced bowel regimen ___.  

# Syncope: Pt had possible syncopal episode resulting in his 
presentation to OSH.  Etiology could have been atrial 
fibrillation, which could cause syncope associated with 
post-conversion pauses.  Carotid US at OSH was reportedly 
without hemodynamically significant disease.  Ddx also included 
orthostatic hypotension, hypovolemia.  He had no syncopal events 
at ___, though he mostly did not get out of bed.  No further 
work-up was undertaken at ___, aside from treating atrial 
fibrillation as above.

CHRONIC DIAGNOSES

# Chronic kidney disease: Baseline Cr 1.3.  Serum Cr was 1.4 on 
admission and 1.3 on discharge, stable throughout 
hospitalization with daily checking.  Attention to renal dosage 
of medications and avoidance of nephrotoxins was maintained.
 
# HTN: Pt was placed on metoprolol; other home antihypertensives 
(clonidine and lisinopril) were held while titrating metoprolol. 
 A dosage of 75mg q 8hrs was selected, as higher dosages failed 
to control exertional tachycardia but did result in pauses on 
telemetry.  Blood pressure was well controlled in hospital.  
After ablation, metoprolol was decreased to prior home dose of 
25mg BID.  Other antihypertensives were stopped.

# CAD: Continued metoprolol, ASA 81mg, and simvastatin.

# HLD: Continued home simvastatin. 
 
# Gout: No acute exacerbation of chronic disease.  Continued 
home allopurinol.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES
# Anticoagulation: On warfarin for pulmonary emboli and atrial 
fibrillation. Goal INR 2.5 to 3.5 (elevated since PE may have 
developed while on warfarin).
# Atrial fibrillation s/p ablation and permanent pacemaker 
placement: Follow-up with device clinic within one week. Stop PO 
clindamycin after 72-hr course (take it through ___ for 
infection prophylaxis after pacemaker placement.
# Post-op ___ quadriceps repair ___: orthopedic surgeon is 
Dr. ___ # ___. Activity status: WBAT 
through RLE with knee immobilizer on in extension with 
crutches/walker. No range of movement of ___ knee until 
cleared by Dr. ___ surgeon. Follow-up with 
Dr. ___.  Adjustment of brace type as per his 
recommendations.
# History of hypertension: BP was well controlled in the 
hospital. Clonidine and lisinopril had been held from the start 
of admission, and metoprolol was decreased to his original home 
dose after the ablation. If hypertension is a problem after 
discharge, consider restarting lisinopril as an outpatient.
# CXR PA/lateral ___ revealed small opacity in the anterior 
mediastinum: advise further characterization by CT

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,

It was a sincere pleasure taking care of you at ___ 
___.  As you know, you went to the hospital 
initially after a fall and an episode of unresponsiveness.  At 
the outside hospital, you underwent a repair of the quadriceps 
muscle.  You had a rapid heart rate and an irregular rhythm.  
Also, you developed blood clots in your lungs.  You were 
transferred to ___ for further management.  

Here, you were treated with blood thinners in order to treat the 
blood clots in your lungs.  Your rapid heart rate was controlled 
with oral medicines, though you continued to have a very fast 
heart rate with even minimal exertion.  Ultimately it was 
decided to place a pacemaker to help control the heart rate so 
that you can get back to activity, especially rehab for your 
knee surgery.  You tolerated the procedure well and were 
discharged to rehab. 

Please see the attached medication list for changes to your 
regimen.  

We wish you the very best in the recovery process.

prior PEs, HTN, HLD, gout, glaucoma and recent admission
(___) for fall c/b ___ transferred from ___ after presenting with unresponsiveness.

Per review of records and discussion with Mr. ___ facility,
he was last seen alert and conversant this morning at 05:00;
subsequently, on nursing check around 07:00, he was noted to be
somnolent and not responsive to noxious stimuli, though without
further vital sign derangements. He was taken to ___, where, en route, he received naloxone without
effect. At ___, bilateral arm movement was observed, raising
concerns for intercurrent seizures (with scattered reports from
EMS and other providers regarding ?convulsions with initial
unresponsiveness, not corroborated in nursing documentation from
Mr. ___ and prompting administration of 2 mg IV
lorazepam, also without effect. Mr. ___ was accordingly
transferred to ___ for further evaluation.

Notably, Mr. ___ was recently admitted to ___ after a fall 
at
his ___, where he was found to have a right temporal tSAH. Mr.
___ anticoagulation was reversed and, per his son's
understanding, he was deemed to be at high risk of ICH but at
comparatively lower risk of recurrent ischemic infarcts (despite
CHADsVASc of 6 during the prior admission), prompting
discontinuation of warfarin. Per review of records, note is made
at Mr. ___ visit that there were no
restrictions on resuming anticoagulation, but that, "It may be
devastating next time he falls again."

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr ___,  

 You were hospitalized due to symptoms of unresponsiveness 
resulting from an ACUTE ISCHEMIC STROKE, a condition where a 
blood vessel providing oxygen and nutrients to the brain is 
blocked by a clot. The brain is the part of your body that 
controls and directs all the other parts of your body, so damage 
to the brain from being deprived of its blood supply can result 
in a variety of symptoms.  

 Stroke can have many different causes, so we assessed you for 
medical conditions that might raise your risk of having stroke. 
In order to prevent future strokes, we plan to modify those risk 
factors. Your risk factors are:  
 atrial fibrillation
 vascular dementia
 previous strokes
 hypertension
 hyperlipidemia

After a long discussion with your family and HCP, they decided 
to pursue comfort measures only.

 Sincerely,  

 Your ___ Neurology Team  

 
Followup Instructions:

History of Present Illness:
___ yo M with history of CAD, HTN, Afib on warfarin, prior CVA, 
vascular dementia and CKD presents after mechanical fall at ___ 
found to have SAH. 

Per phone discussion with staff at ___, patient was 
sleeping in a low bed approximately 4 inches off the ground.  He 
rolled out of bed onto the floor and because he was on warfarin 
was transferred to an outside hospital.  The staff reports that 
at his baseline he is very confused and typically does not know 
the year or the month.  He does have periods of being oriented,
though this is typically after he has spent time with his 
family. They also report that he is been having congestion for 
the last several days and was recently started on prednisone 60 
mg tapering every 2 days.

At the outside hospital a CT C-spine was negative and a CT head 
demonstrated subarachnoid hemorrhage in the right temporal 
region.  His INR was 4.2 and he received 1 g of Keppra 10 mg of 
vitamin K and 3 Thousand 282 units of Kcentra he was then 
transferred to ___ for neurosurgery consult.

Patient reports that he typically runs 5 miles every day and has 
had some falls recently that is why his son brought him in for 
evaluation.  He is very concerned about regaining his strength 
and would like to go back to the gym as soon as possible. 
Currently endorses no fevers, chills, nausea, vomiting, chest
pain, shortness of breath, weakness or numbness.  He does report 
that he has been coughing for several weeks now but feels as 
though this is improving.

IMAGING
=======
___ CT Head w/o Contrast:
FINDINGS:  
Seen again is the hyperdensity in the right temporal lobe 
consistent with a subarachnoid bleed.  Compared to the prior 
study, there is no evidence of
interval enlargement or new bleed.  There is no edema, shift of 
normally 
midline structures, or evidence of acute major vascular 
territorial infarction.  Hypodensity seen in the right parietal 
lobe consistent with old infarct.  Ventricles and sulci are 
prominent consistent with age-related involutional change.  
Periventricular white matter hypodensity consistent small vessel 
ischemic changes. 
  
There is a overlying left frontal subgaleal hematoma without 
acute fracture. The imaged paranasal sinuses are clear. Mastoid 
air cells and middle ear cavities are well aerated. The bony 
calvarium is intact. 
  
IMPRESSION:  
No interval enlargement of right temporal subarachnoid 
hemorrhage.  No 
evidence of new hemorrhage or mass effect.

CXR ___:
Pulmonary edema has resolved.  Left-sided pacemaker is 
unchanged. Moderate 
cardiomegaly is again seen.  There is no pleural effusion.  No 
neumothorax is seen.
 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ year old male with a history of CAD, HTN, Afib on warfarin, 
prior CVA, vascular dementia and CKD presents after mechanical 
fall at ___ found to have SAH. Warfarin was reversed, and he was 
seen by neurosurgery who determined that there was no need for 
surgical intervention. Plan to hold AC for at least two weeks 
and goal SBP <160. He also had URI symptoms and a leukocytosis 
on admission thought to be due to recent prednisone treatment, 
which resolved after holding steroids and his URI symptoms 
resolved without intervention.

ACUTE/ACTIVE PROBLEMS
=====================
# SAH s/p fall:
Presenting after mechanical fall with headstrike. Found to have 
supratheraputic INR and SAH. Received Vitamin K, Kcentra and 
Keppra and transferred for neurosurgery eval. SAH remains stable 
on CT head, no intervention planned by neurosurgery. From 
history fall appears purely mechanical without evidence of 
syncope. Monitored on telemetery without incident. Plan for 
follow up with neurosurgery in 2 weeks, holding antiplatelet 
agents / anticoagulation until then.

# HTN:
Not on home anti-HTN. BP has been somewhat variable this 
admission, SBPs mostly 140-150, will add amlodipine 5MG daily 
until neurosurgery follow up to keep BP <160 after SAH. If BPs 
stay consistently below 145 and cleared by neurosurgery, OK to 
discontinue this due to concern for orthostatic hypotension / 
falls in the future.

# A fib:
CHADSVASC 6. S/p AV node ablation with pacemaker implant in ___ 
for chronic AF with rapid ventricular response. Currently 
holding warfarin in setting of SAH as above until cleared by 
neurosurgery, although the decision to restart anticoagulation 
at all will have to be made given the patients recent falls and 
now confirmed SAH on warfarin. Formal recommendation is to hold 
anticoagulation given higher risk from bleed over stroke, but 
decision can be made at outpatient neurosurgery appointment 
after understanding the risks of either decision. Continued 
metoprolol tartrate 25 mg twice daily. 

# Bronchitis 
# Leukocytosis - resolved
Presenting with mild leukocytosis with no fever though with 
cough of several weeks.  Per report from ___ patient was 
recently diagnosed with bronchitis and started on prednisone 
burst.  Suspect leukocytosis is in setting of steroid 
administration versus reactive from SAH, which resolved without 
intervention.

CHRONIC/STABLE PROBLEMS
======================= 
# CKD:
Unclear baseline creatinine though in ___ was noted to be stage 
III with baseline Cr 1.3. Cr near baseline this admission

# GERD:
Continued pantoprazole

# Insomnia:
Continued mirtazapine

# Hyperlipidemia:
Continued atorvastatin

# Dementia:
Continued donezepil

# CAD:
Unclear cardiac history, though with documented CAD in OMR from 
___. Continued statin. Not on ASA, would not start it 
especially in near future given SAH as above.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES
===================
DISCHARGE HBG: 13.9
DISCHARGE CR: 1.5
[ ] Continue to monitor BP, goal SBP <160. Patient was started 
on amlodipine this admission, can uptitrate if necessary. If BPs 
are persistently <130 and/or cleared by neurosurgery, please 
discontinue it.
[ ] Hold anticoagulation until neurosurgery follow up 
appointment. Continue discussions with the patient/son about the 
risks and benefits of warfarin going forward. Patient should 
call ___ for Neurosurgery follow-up if issues with 
scheduling the appointment
