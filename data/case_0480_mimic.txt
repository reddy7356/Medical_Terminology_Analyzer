CT CHEST ___
IMPRESSION:
1. Right upper lobe consolidation associated with underlying 
focal emphysema/
confluent cysts and lymphadenopathy likely represents acute 
infection.
Additionally, multiple peribronchial nodular opacities may 
represent an
infectious etiology. However, it is difficult to exclude 
underlying
neoplasm/neoplastic infiltration and repeat CT folowing 
resolution of acute
issues is recommended.
2. Right inguinal and external iliac adenopathy.
3. Moderate-to-severe splenomegaly.
4. Pleural thickening/calcifications may be related to prior 
asbestos
exposure.
5. Hypoattenuating hepatic lesions are too small to 
characterize.

CT CHEST ___
IMPRESSION:
1. Mixed response of multifocal infections, including interval 
progression of
right upper lobe and left lower lobe consolidations, improvement 
and
cavitation of previously dominant right upper lobe consolidation 
and diffuse
right upper lobe peribronchial infiltration. This pattern 
suggests the ongoing
infection may be due to organisms other than those responding to 
ongoing
antibiotic treatment.
2. Slight interval decrease in extensive central 
lymphadenopathy.
3. Atherosclerotic coronary artery calcifications.
4. Splenomegaly.
.
CT Chest on ___
IMPRESSION: Mixed response of multifocal infection with minimal 
decrease in size in left lower lobe consolidation and right 
upper posterior consolidation and stable cavitary consolidation 
in the right apex. 
1.Stable centrilobular emphysema. 
2.Stable mediastinal lymphadenopathy. Minimal decrease in left 
hilar 
lymphadenopathy. 
3.Stable splenomegaly. 
4.Coronary artery calcifications.
.
CT Chest on ___
IMPRESSION: Continuous improvement. There is decrease in size in 
right upper lobe rounded posterior opacity and left lower lobe 
consolidation, stable cavitary consolidation in the apex with 
improved peribronchial consolidation associated with right 
apical bronchiectasis. Improved interlobular septal thickening, 
ground glass and reticulation in the 
lower lobe with improving lymphangitic stasis and maybe fluid 
overload. 
Stable mediastinal lymphadenopathy. Decrease in bilateral hilar 
lymphadenopathy. Coronary calcification. 
.
CT Chest on ___
IMPRESSION: 
1. No significant interval change in bilateral consolidative 
opacities and 
masses. 
2. Right apical cavitation is unchanged. Left lower lobe mass is 
unchanged 
in size, but has new areas of lucency which could suggest early 
cavitation 
versus bronchiectatic airways. 
.
BONE MARROW ASPIRATE AND CORE BIOPSY ___:
DIAGNOSIS:

Acute myelogenous leukemia with multilineage dysplasia, see 
note.

Note:  In a patient with a previous history of MDS ___ clinical 
history, slides not reviewed at ___, and trilineage 
dysplasia, the findings are consistent with acute myelogenous 
leukemia arising from a multilineage dysplasia.  The blast 
morphology is consistent with monoblastic leukemia (FAB M5).  
Correlation with cytogenetic studies is recommended. Slides 
reviewed at the clinical-hematology conference (___).

MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION

Peripheral Blood Smear:

The smear is adequate.  Erythrocytes are moderately decreased in 
number and show moderate anisocytosis with microcytic forms 
present.  There is minimal poikilocytosis with rare dacrocytes.  
Scatted nucleated red blood cells are noted.  The white blood 
cell count appears increased and is composed predominantly of a 
blast population which is intermediate to large size with scant 
cytoplasm, somewhat irregular nuclear contours, irregular 
chromatin and one to two prominent nucleoli.  Some of the cells  
have cytoplasmic vacuoles but lack granules or Auer rods.  A few 
mature monocytes as well as young promonocytes are also present. 
 Hypogranular and irregularly segmented neutrophils are seen.   
Platelet count appears decreased.  Large dysplastic platelets 
are seen.  Differential shows   3% neutrophils,  2% monocytes,  
and 95% blasts, which include promonocytic forms. 

Aspirate Smear:

The aspirate material is adequate for evaluation.  The majority 
of the aspirate material consists of monoblasts along with 
scattered monocytic precursors.  Of the remaining hematopoietic 
elements, the M:E ratio is <1:1.   Erythroid precursors are 
relatively decreased in number and reveal megaloblastic 
maturation with asymmetric nuclear budding and occasional forms 
with micronucleus.  Myeloid precursors appear relatively 
decreased in number and show left-shifted maturation with rare 
maturing elements.  Histiocytes with imbibed cellular elements 
are present.   Megakaryocytes are present.  A few dysplastic 
megakaryocytes including a rare "pawn ball form" is seen.  
Differential shows:  72% Blasts,  <1% Promyelocytes, <1% 
Myelocytes, 2% Metamyelocytes, 2% Bands/Neutrophils, 2% Plasma 
cells,  5% Lymphocytes, 16% Erythroid.

Biopsy Slides:

The biopsy material is adequate for evaluation   The marrow 
cellularity is >95% and consists predominantly of an 
interstitial  and diffuse infiltrate of  immature blasts 
(similar to that described above).  Hematopoietic elements 
including megakaryocytes (some with dysplastic features); 
Erythroid and scant mature myeloid forms are present, 
interspersed in the infiltrate.

BONE MARROW ASPIRATE AND CORE BIOPSY ___:

DIAGNOSIS:

MARKEDLY HYPOCELLULAR BONE MARROW (5%) WITH CHANGES CONSISTENT 
WITH CHEMOTHERAPY INDUCED ABLATION.

ONE PERITRABECULAR LYMPHOID AGGREGATE IS SEEN, MOST LIKELY OF A 
REACTIVE NATURE.

Note: The majority of bone marrow cellularity is represented by 
stromal cells, plasma cells and histiocytes. Immunoperoxidase 
studies on the core show that the lymphoid cells both 
interstitial and in aggregates are predominantly T cells and 
stain for CD3, CD5, and Bcl-2, but lack reactivity with CD10 and 
Bcl-6.

MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION

Peripheral Blood Smear:

The smear is adequate.  Erythrocytes show marked 
anisopoikilocytosis. Numerous abnormal forms are seen including 
schistocytes and burr cells. The white blood cell count appears 
markedly decreased and primarily represented by lymphocytes. 
Platelet count appears markedly decreased. Large forms are not 
seen. Differential shows 0% neutrophils, 0% bands, 4% monocytes, 
95% lymphocytes, 0% eosinophils, 1% blasts.

Aspirate Smear:

The aspirate material is suboptimal due to paucity of spicules. 
The M:E ratio is decreased. Erythroid precursors are markedly 
decreased. Myeloid precursors appear decreased. Megakaryocytes 
are decreased in numbers. Differential (300 cells) shows:  <1% 
Blasts,  0% Promyelocytes, 0% Myelocytes, 0% Metamyelocytes, 0% 
Bands/Neutrophils, 33% Plasma cells, 49% Lymphocytes, 16% 
Erythroid.

Clot Section and Biopsy Slides:

The biopsy material is adequate but small. The biopsy shows 
hypocellular bone marrow (5%) with virtually no maturing 
hematopoietic elements. The majority of the cells are 
represented by bone marrow stromal cells, plasma cells and 
histiocytes. Scant lymphocytes are noted in the background. 
Abundant intercellular eosinophilic debris are present 
consistent with ablative chemotherapy effect. Rare ___ 
bodies are noted. A small paratrabecular lymphoid aggregate 
comprised of small lymphocytes is present. There is an 
interstitial infiltrate of plasma cells occurring singly and in 
small clusters occupying 5% of marrow cellularity. Marrow clot 
section is submitted, contain few spicules for evaluation.

Bone marrow biopsy performed on day prior to discharge with 
results pending at D/C

  

 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ y.o male with past medical history of coronary artery disease 
and MDS presenting with a new diagnosis of leukemia. 
.  
1)AML: Mr. ___ presented with new leukemia determined to 
be AML that likely transformed from pre-existing MDS. ___ was 
initially treated with hydrea to reduce his white cell count. 
Further chemotherapy was postponed while patient received broad 
spectrum antibiotics for his lung infection. Infection improved 
and patient begun on Idarubicin and AraC on ___. Patient 
tolerated chemotherapy with few side effects. On day 14 of his 7 
and 3 chemotherapy regimen (___) his marrow was biopsied and 
found to be hypocellular. During the time that patient was 
neutropenic his lung infection began to worsen again as noted 
below. Pt's marrow was not repopulating well, which was 
attributed to the myelosuppresive effects of the bactrim ___ was 
on. His bactrim was discontinued on ___, but ANC still remained 
<100, Hct ~24, Plt ___. Another BM bx on ___ (day #35)showed 
7% blasts with cytogenetics that were initially read as recovery 
blasts and marrow effects of G-CSF.  Eventually nearly 40 days 
after beginning his chemotherapy Mr. ___ cytopenias 
began to resolve.  Unfortunately, the day after discontinuation 
of G-CSF ___ once again became neutropenic and repeat bone marrow 
biopsy was done in order to obtain results not under the 
influence of G-CSF.  After this test G-CSF was restarted and the 
patient was discharged after ___ once again had an ___>1000 with 
results of his bone marrow biopsy still pending and close follow 
up scheduled.  Mr ___ also had a lesion of his hand that 
was biopsied to rule out leukemia cutis but this was negative.  
.
2) Lung Infection: Patient presented with productive cough for 
nearly three weeks. CT  on ___ showed a "complex airspace 
process in the periphery of the right upper lobe with apparent 
cavitary components. A RUL bronchoscopy w/ BAL on ___, was 
remarkable for friable mucosa, but negative for growth or 
cytology. Sputum AFB neg x 3. Crypto, CMV, Nocardia, legionella, 
fungal, all neg. A CT guided biopsy on ___ did grow organisms 
consistent with nocardia sp.(final results and sensitivities 
still pending). Patient was initially treated with vancomycin 
cefepime that was broadened to vanc/zosyn and voriconazole when 
pt continued to spike fevers. Patient improved clinically while 
on vanco/zosyn/posaconazole, remaining afebrile and showing 
significant improvement in respiratory status prior to and 
during his induction chemotherapy. On ___ lung tissue 
preliminary results suggested a nocardia species. Zosyn was 
changed to Meropenem for improved Nocardia coverage. Around day 
16 patient began to spike daily fevers. A Chest CT on ___ 
showed significant worsening of lung lesions compared to 
previous Chest CT indicating either resistant or new organisms. 
ID recommended adding high dose Bactrim given known efficacy of 
this drug against Nocardia. Then on ___ CT chest was repeated 
showing significant worsening of lung lesions. Once Bactrim was 
started pt became afebrile. ___ CT chest showed minimal 
decrease in consolidations. Repeat BAL grew no organisms. Pt 
remained afebrile for almost 2 wks. Unfortunately, because the 
patient's counts were very slow in recovering and Bactrim is 
myelosuppressive ___ was switched to Ceftriaxone/Moxifloxacin on 
___ after final sensitivities came back on the patient's 
nocardia.  On ___ the patient spiked a fever again, but new CT 
chest showed continuous improvement of lung infection. ID noted 
that pt's aspergillus galactomanan returned positive suggested 
___ had two infections concurrently.  At this point Caspofungin 
was added to the Voriconazole the patient was already on for 
neutropenic fever.  Unfortunately, as neutropenia continued to 
lengthen the patient did not defervesce and continued to have 
fever spikes on most days.  Eventually, because of continued 
fevers ___ was switched back from 
ceftriaxone/moxifloxacin/voriconazole/Caspofungin to 
Meropenem/Moxifloxacin/Voriconazole/Caspofungin for better 
nocardia coverage then vancomycin and amikacin were eventually 
added for continued fevers.  Despite this extremely broad 
spectrum coverage the patient continued to spike until his 
granulocytes began to recover at which point ___ stopped having 
fevers. As ___ defervesced we removed a able to remove 
antibiotics and at discharge ___ was down to two drug oral 
regimen of Voriconazole and TMP/Sulfa.  With granulocyte 
recovery there was also some lessening of rhonchi and course 
breath sounds heard in the bilateral lower lungs so that there 
were just crackles and mildly decreased breath sounds in the 
left base at the time of discharge.  Patient continued to have 
productive cough at discharge but no shortness of breath or 
hypoxia.  Patient had defervesced for > 36 hours at time of 
discharge. 
.
3) C. Difficile: The patient had diarrhea that was tested and 
found to have C Difficile by stool culture on ___.  ___ was 
initially started on a course of Metronidazole that was switched 
to PO vancomycin because of poor improvement.  After switch to 
PO vancomycin the patient improved significantly and had much 
less stool output.  At time of discharge ___ was only having ___ 
loose stools/day.  ___ was continued on PO vancomycin at 
discharge given long period of broad antibiotic coverage and 
continued antibiotic pressure.  
.
4) CAD: Stable during this admission. No chest pain or shortness 
of breath at any time. Patient's outpatient medications 
including ASA, Lipitor and atenolol were held.  ___ was started 
on Metoprolol. Blood pressure was well controlled. ___ was 
restarted on his atenolol at discharge but Lipitor continued to 
be held fearing hepatic interactions with Voriconazole.  Aspirin 
was held at discharge given the patient was still 
thrombocytopenic
.
5) GERD: The patient was maintained on his outpatient Omeprazole 
and his GERD was stable during this admission.    
.
The patient was fed a neutropenic diet.  ___ ambulated for DVT 
prophylaxis.  ___ was full code.

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted to the hospital with acute leukemia. You were 
also found to have a serious lung infection. We gave you some 
chemotherapy to control your leukemia and also began treating 
your lung infection with antibiotics. When you had improved from 
your lung infection we gave you a seven day course of 
chemotherapy. You had few side effects and responded well to the 
chemotherapy. While your blood counts were low, your lung 
infection worsened, and we had to give your more antibiotics and 
do a second bronchoscopy to sample your lung fluid.  We put you 
on broad spectrum antibiotics, but you continued to have fevers 
while your blood counts were low. We gave you a medication to 
help your blood counts recover more quickly, but it took some 
time.  As your counts started to increase you stopped having 
fevers and we were able to decrease the number of antibiotics 
you were taking.  You also developed a particular type of 
diarrhea in the hospital that can be a consequence of being on a 
lot of antibiotics.  This has improved as we had you on less 
antibiotics and your immune system recovered.   
.
Your medications have been changed.  We have started you on 
VORICONAZOLE and BACTRIM to cure your lung infection.  You have 
also been started on VANCOMYCIN, an oral medication to help 
eliminate the bacteria that caused your diarrhea.  In addition 
you have been started on NEUPOGEN, a shot to help keep your 
blood counts up and protect you from infection (do not fill this 
prescription or take this medication until instructed by your 
doctors).  Finally, you have also been started on TESSALON to 
help manage your cough. Otherwise continue to take all your 
medications as prescribed.  
.
Please keep all scheduled follow-up appointments as these are 
important to help maintain your health.  
.
Please call your oncologist if the following were to develop: 
chest pain, shortness of breath, palpatations, cough, dizziness, 
confusion, headache, abdomenal pain, diarrhea, nausea or 
vomiting, or swelling.  If any of these symptoms should become 
severe, please go your local ER.

CXR Upon admission:
Lower lobe airspace opacification is increased in comparison to 
___, and worrisome for pneumonia. The right upper lobe 
cavitary lesion is slightly improved, with less parenchymal 
abnormality of the lateral aspect of the lesion.  The hila are 
progressively enlarged. Interstial prominence and vascular 
indistinctness are suggestive of interstitial edema, however, 
findings could be due to widespread interstitial pneumonia, such 
as pneumocystis. The right central venous catheter terminates 
within the lower SVC, unchanged. Cardiac silhouette is stable.

CT Upon Admission:
FINDINGS: 
No filling defect in pulmonary artery branches suggestive of 
pulmonary 
embolism. Again seen are large cavitary lesions in both lungs. 
Lesion 1, located in right upper lobe (3:33), has significantly 
increased in size from ___ to ___, and the overall size is 
stable since then. The cavitary portion of the lesion has 
decreased in size but the wall is thicker, and on today's exam, 
there is more extension to the direction of the hilum. Lesion 2 
located in right upper lobe (3:52) was new in ___, had 
increased in size and cavitated in ___ the cavity 
diameter has decreased but the wall is thicker both on ___ and today. Lesion 3 located in posterior basal left lower 
lobe (3:85) has similar behaviour as lesion 2: it appeared as a 
new lesion in ___, has significantly progressed in size in 
___, stable in size subsequently,since then, though 
developing small cavities growing since  ___. Lesion 4 
(3:51), a new finding since ___, is an area of ground- 
glass opacity in the anterior segment of right upper lobe that 
could represents an area of hemorrhage or infection. An area of 
ground glass opacity in the left upper lobe on ___ has 
resolved on today's study, and could have represented an area of 
aspiration. Greatly enlarged, numerous mediastinal and hilar 
lymph nodes (up to 19mm in the subcarinal station and 23mm in 
the left hilus) first grew from ___ to ___, stabilized until 
___, but have subsequently grown. Heart size is normal 
despite coronary artery calcifications. The aorta is 
unremarkable. A central line traverses the right jugular vein 
terminating in the cavoatrial junction. Pleural calcifications 
trace the right lateral costal and diaphragmatice surfaces. 
There is no pleural effusion. Small pericardial effusion is 
stable since ___. Centrilobular and paraseptal emphysema 
is again noted. Moderate splenomegaly is persistent. 
Degenerative changes are present in the thoracic spine. 
IMPRESSION: 
1. Negative examination for pulmonary embolism. 
2. Multifocal necrotizing infection. Due to varied onset and 
behaviour, there is probably more than one pathogen. 
3. Progressive severe central adenopathy. 
4. New area of ground-glass opacity in right lower lobe that 
could represent another infection or hemorrhage. 
5. Stable small pericardial effusion. 
6. Stable pleural calcifications. 
7. Splenomegaly, partially imaged 

Latest CT-chest on (___):
No filling defect in pulmonary artery branches suggestive of 
pulmonary 
embolism. Compared to prior study done the day before, ___, the lung abnormalities are unchanged: Right upper lobe 
cavitary lesion, diffuse right upper lobe consolidation, as well 
as ill-defined ground glass opacity and nodular 
consolidation/mass of the left lower lobe and partially cavitary 
left lower lobe mass; focal consolidation in right middle lobe 
also unchanged. No evidence of pleural effusions. Persistent 
small unchanged pericardial effusion. Stable hilar, mediastinal, 
and axillary lymphadenopathy. No suspicious lytic or blastic 
osseous lesion is identified. Splenomegaly is partially imaged. 
IMPRESSION: 
1. No evidence of pulmonary embolism. 
2. Unchanged appearance of lung opacities, masses, and cavities. 
No pleural 
effusion at present study. 
3. Unchanged extensive hilar, mediastinal, and axillary 
lymphadenopathy. 

Latest CT-pelvis/abdomen:
1. Diffuse patchy ground-glass attenuation in the visualized 
lung bases, with nodular opacities and cavitary process are 
similar to that previously seen on CT abdomen/pelvis of ___ 
except to note slight increase in coalescence of nodular 
opacities along the left lateral sulcus. 
  
2. Bulky portal, retroperitoneal, mesenteric, iliac and inguinal 
adenopathy as seen on ___, except to note some increased 
stranding surrounding a midabdominal mesenteric lymph node 
conglomerate, with interval development of regions of 
hypoattenuation, consistent with regions of necrosis. 
Superimposed infection is a consideration. 
  
3. No evidence of bowel obstruction however note is made of 
marked fecal 
loading. 

EKG: QTc 444 on ___ man with refractory AML-M5, status post induction 
with 7+3 and re-induction with HiDAC with admissions complicated 
by Nocardia pneumonia, questionable Aspergillus pneumonia who 
presented with dyspnea.
.
# DYSPNEA - Patient with history of nocardia pneumonia isolated 
from lung biopsy in a prior admission. Patient was discharged on 
Bactrim/moxifloxacin, but the moxifloxacin was stopped as 
outpatient. Patient now came with severe dyspnea desating to low 
___ and required high-oxygen therapy with nasal canula and face 
mask, but still going down to low ___ with activity. CT showed 
worsening pulmonary infiltrates, no signs of COPD or PE. Patient 
had negative induced sputum and bronchoscopy (cytology, stains 
and cultures). Biopsy was not performed since patient was 
considered with refractory disease and prior biopsy that grew 
nocardia. Patient was originally treated with 
Bactrim/moxifloxacin without improvement. Then, based on prior 
cultures was switched to clarithromycin/amikacin and improved by 
CT and O2 requirements went down up to 4 L NC (95%) and going up 
to 87-88% with activity. Since prior discharge patient has been 
covered for aspergillus with voriconazole. Patient required 
After discussing with infectious disease patient will need 
continuous therapy with amikacin / clarithromycin / voriconazole 
for indeterminate period of time. Infectious disease at the 
___ will be following for infection. Patient will need weekly 
voriconazole/amikacin trough. Please fax results to Dr. ___ 
___: ___, Fax: ___. Patient will 
also need every other week EKG since voriconazole/clarithromycin 
can prolong QT (last QTc 444).

.
ACUTE MYELOGENOUS LEUKEMIA - Patient with AML-M5 which has 
failed 7+3 and HiDAC therapies in the past. Patient was during 
admission with persistent blasts and high WBC count (~12,000). 
He was treated with hydroxyurea, but became neutropenic and 
dropped WBC up to 2,000, so treatment was stopped. Patient had 
worsening lymphadenopathy on physical exam and CT scan of chest 
and abdomen. FNA was performed and was found to have AML 
infiltration in lymph nodes. Biopsy was not done because it was 
considered very high risk with his breathing status. Patient was 
started on levalidomide to prevent further progression 
understanding that the data in this area is extremely scarce and 
anecdotal (Day 1 = ___. Since patient has active blast and 
active disease despite chemotherapy was not considered a 
transplant candidate. Last WBC 2,500 with ANC 500 and 28% 
blasts. Since re-starting revlimid patient has been complaining 
of dry mouth and congested sinuses. Normal physical exam and 
being treated symptomatically with pseudoephedrine and menthol. 
During hospitalization patient required occasional RBC 
transfusions.

.

complicated by C. Diff colitis and he was taking PO vancomycin 
on admission.  This medication was continued and when patient 
improving therapy was stopped. Patient was >1 week symptom free 
despite broad-spectrum antibiotics.

.
ABDOMINAL PAIN - He had some abdominal pain on ___.  An 
abdominal plain film showed no evidence of ileus or obstruction. 
CT scans of abdomen only show huge lymphadenopathy, which may be 
compatible with AML infiltration per FNA (see above). No signs 
of obstruction, but there was always a lot of stool in colon. 
Patient was treated symptomatically with standing morphine SR 15 
mg BID and with morphine ___ (liquid to avoid confusion with 
pills) 20 mg q2 Horus PRN. Patient needing 1 dose PRN daily upon 
discharge. Patient was discharged moving his bowels daily, with 
standing senna/Colace despite opioid therapy.

___: 15.4  PTT: 29.9  INR: 1.4 

CT Chest ___:
FINDINGS: Coronary artery calcification. The ascending aorta is 
mildly 
dilated at 4 cm at the level of the right pulmonary artery 
without recent 
change. Right IJ catheter with tip in the right atrium. Central 
pulmonary 
vasculature is unremarkable. 9-mm short axis anterior 
mediastinal node.  
Right paratracheal node measuring 8 mm in short axis is stable. 
Additional 
subcentimeter mesenteric nodes, also without significant change. 

  
The spleen is again noted to be enlarged. Small amount of 
calcified pleural plaque is seen along the right hemidiaphragm. 
  
Emphysematous changes in the lungs with subpleural blebs most 
prominent at the right lung apex. The patient also has cavity 
with a mildly thickened wall in the right upper lobe. Cavity is 
compatible with patient's history of fungal infection or 
nocardia. The cavity measures 5.5 x 3.3 cm, decreased from 6.2 x 
4.1 cm. There is adjacent pleural thickening which is also seen 
previously.  On the previous study, there was a nodule in the 
posterior right upper lobe, which currently appears as a 
thin-walled cavity measuring 1.9 cm on series 3, image 24. Again 
seen is a cavity in the left lower lobe with peripheral gas and 
moderate soft tissue. The cavitation is new since the previous 
study.  This nodule measures 3.8 x 3.1 cm, decreased from 
previous 3.8 x 4.4 cm. Mild additional changes in the spine. 
Additional calcified pleural plaque along the right lateral 
hemithorax. 
.
IMPRESSION:
Overall, mild improvement with increased cavitation in left 
lower lobe and right upper lobe nodules. Stable cavity in the 
right upper lobe near the apex. Findings are compatible with 
patient's history of fungal pneumonia.   
.
CT SINUS ___
FINDINGS: The right maxillary and sphenoid sinuses show mild 
mucosal 
thickening. There is scattered opacification of the ethmoid air 
cells and 
secretions in the right nasal passage. The remainder of the 
visualized 
paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells remain normally aerated. 
The OMUs are patent bilaterally.The osseous structures are 
normal. There is a prominent vascular structure superior to the 
pterygoid muscle on the right, which may represent a prominent 
maxillary artery. 
.  
IMPRESSION: 
1. Mild mucosal sinus disease involving the maxillary and 
sphenoid sinuses on the right. 
2. Prominent vascular structure superior to the right pterygoid 
muscle, which may represent dilated maxillary artery. 
.  
Final Attending Comment: 
There is question of bony dehiscence/demineralization in the 
roof of the 
ethmoid sinus on the left with contiguous opacification of the 
ethmoid air 
cell.The possibility of fungal sinusitis cannot be 
excluded.Findings conveyed to Dr ___ possibility is 
meningoencephalocele and recommend correlation with MRI of the 
skull base/orbits for further evaluation. Discussed with ENT 
resident on call. 
.
___ Bone marrow Biopsy (prior admission)
SPECIMEN: BONE MARROW ASPIRATE AND CORE BIOPSY:
DIAGNOSIS: 
Hypercellular bone marrow with increased blasts suspicious for 
persistent/recurrent acute myelogenous leukemia, see note.

Note: Monoblasts are enumerated at 21% in the bone marrow 
aspirate.  There is multilineage dysplasia with atypical nuclear 
budding in the erythroid precursors and hypolobated 
megakaryocytes consistent with underlying MDS.  ___ case was 
discussed at the hematology malignancy board conference on 
___.  The previous bone marrow specimen (___) was 
reviewed in conjunction with this specimen.

ADDENDUM: AFB stains were performed at the request of the 
submitting physician and they are negative for acid fast 
bacilliforms.

KARYOTYPE: 46,XY[CP20] 
  
INTERPRETATION:  
No clonal cytogenetic aberrations were identified 
in 20 metaphases analyzed from this unstimulated

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient is a ___ y.o male with a history of coronary artery 
disease and AML s/p 7+3 who presented for High Dose AraC 
reinduction after 7+3 did not induce remission on Day 14 Bone 
marrow.  
.
# AML RELAPSE: The patient received Ara C 3 g/m2 every 12 hours 
on days one, three, and five as re-induction chemotherapy.  He 
tolerated this chemotherapy well without any nausea, mouth 
sores, or signs of cerebellar toxicity.  Given his prolonged 
neutropenia following his last round of chemotherapy  and known 
lung infections he was kept in the hospital after receiving his 
HiDAC and as his counts began to fall. On D+9, the patient 
reached his nadir, with an ANC of 0 and platelet count of 9. His 
counts remained low up until day 19 raising concern for
