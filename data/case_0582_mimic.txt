___ Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the plastic surgery service on 
___ and had lysis of adhesions, ventral hernia repair with 
component separation and mesh placement.  The patient tolerated 
the procedure well. 
.
Neuro: Post-operatively, the patient had an epidural that was 
managed by Anesthesia service that provided excellent pain 
control. Patient was also given Ativan 0.5mg po PRN for periods 
of anxiety that started in the post-anesthesia care unit.  
Patient was eventually transitioned off of the epidural on POD#1 
and to a dilaudid pca.  This also provided good pain control but 
patient would forget to push the butten until pain had caught up 
with him.  On post-operative day #3 (POD#3) the dilaudid PCA was 
discontinued and the patient was transitioned to strictly PO 
dilaudid.  The PO dilaudid provided good pain control but 
patient was frustrated with the amount and frequency of his pain 
medications so we asked that the Pain Service stop by and see 
patient and provide recommendations for a long acting and a 
short acting pain medication regimen.  Pain service recommended 
MS ___ 15mg po BID with Dilaudid ___ po Q4h PRN.  Patient 
was started on this regimen for 24 hour trial prior to discharge 
home and tolerated quite well.   
.
CV: The patient was stable from a cardiovascular standpoint; 
vital signs were routinely monitored.
.
Pulmonary: The patient was stable from a pulmonary standpoint; 
vital signs were routinely monitored.
.
GI/GU: Post-operatively, the patient was given IV fluids until 
tolerating oral intake. His diet was advanced when appropriate, 
which was tolerated well. He was also started on a bowel regimen 
to encourage bowel movement. He did have a bowel movement on 
POD#4.  Foley was removed on POD#1 and patient voided freely. 
Intake and output were closely monitored. 
.
ID: Post-operatively, the patient was started on IV cefazolin, 
then switched to PO cefadroxil for discharge home with JP drains 
in place. The patient's temperature was closely watched for 
signs of infection. 
.
Prophylaxis: The patient received subcutaneous heparin during 
this stay, and was encouraged to get up and ambulate as early as 
possible. 
.
At the time of discharge on POD#5, the patient was doing well, 
afebrile with stable vital signs, tolerating a regular diet, 
ambulating, voiding without assistance, and pain was well 
controlled.  Patient had a vertical abdominal incisions that 
flat with some ___ ecchymosis and steri-strips in
