Pertinent Results:
Radiology Report MR HEAD W/O CONTRAST Study Date of ___ 
11:04 AM 
FINDINGS:  There is interval right-sided deep brain stimulator 
electrode 
placement.  The electrode is seen traversing from the vertex to 
the right 
basal ganglia.  There is no significant hemorrhage.  There is no 
evidence of 
acute infarct.  Major vascular flow voids are present.  A small 
amount of 
pneumocephalus is noted in the right frontal convexity, an 
expected 
post-procedure finding.  There is no shift of normally midline 
structures.  
There is mild mucosal thickening in the visualized paranasal 
sinuses.  The 
mastoid air cells are clear.  The globes are grossly 
unremarkable.   
  
IMPRESSION:  Interval placement of right-sided deep brain 
stimulator electrode 
to the right basal ganglia.  Expected post-procedure changes 
including a small 
amount of right-sided pneumocephalus but no evidence of 
infarction. 
  
SELLA TURCICA INTRAOP FLUOROSCOPY
 
FINDINGS: 
  
Intraoperative fluoroscopic image demonstrates a deep brain 
stimulator lead 
within the ___ the targeting device. 
  
TOTAL FLUOROSCOPIC TIME:  70.4 seconds. 
  
IMPRESSION: 
  
Intraoperative fluoroscopic imaging was provided for deep brain 
stimulator 
placement within the sella turcica.   

PRE-OP
Radiology Report MR HEAD W & W/O CONTRAST Study Date of ___

Brief Hospital Course:
This is a ___ year old female with history of Parkinsons disease 
that presents today for elective Stage 1 DBS.  The patient 
underwent the procedure well and there were no complications.  A 
immediate post operative MRI was performed and it was consistent 
with expected post operative findings.  The patient was 
restarted on her Parkinsons medications in the PACU and 
recovered from anesthesia.  She was initiated on a clear liquid 
diet and advanced as tolerated.  The patient was transferred to 
the floor after recovery from anesthesia in stable condidtion.

On POD day #1, pt was in stable condition on the floor. She was 
neurologically intact, with findings identical to pre-surgery 
(bilat hand tremors L > R, oriented x 3). Incision was 
clean/dry/intact, with dermabond on top. Post-op MRI showed only 
expected post-op changes. 

Transitional issues:
Pt will be contacted for stage II of DBS (battery placement) in 
2 weeks. Her staples will be removed at that time.
