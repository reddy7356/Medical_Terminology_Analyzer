Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,

It was a pleasure caring for you during your recent 
hospitalization.  You came to the hospital with multiple rashes. 
 Further testing showed that you likely have a drug rash, and 
there is concern for Lyme disease.  You are being treated with 
an antibiotic, doxycycline, for this.  You have a 21 day supply 
of this currently, please take and ask your PCP when you can 
stop this medication.  A skin biopsy was performed and is 
currently pending.  The Dermatology team will call you with the 
results of this biopsy.  You are now being discharged.

You liver function tests were abnormal but are improving.  They 
will need to be rechecked when you follow up with your PCP.

prescribed and follow up with the appointments listed below.

Good luck!
