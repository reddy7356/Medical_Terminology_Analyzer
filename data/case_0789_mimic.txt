Ataxia
 
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
EEG monitoring

 
History of Present Illness:
HPI: Patient is a ___ yo RH man with PMH of simple partial
seizures, learning disability, hypothyroidism,
hyperparathyroidism, HTN and unsteady gait.  He says that he has
had a chronic decline in his gait over the last 6 months, and
started having to use the wall to support him about 2 weeks ago. 

Then, the last 2 days he feels that his gait has had  a more
rapid decline.  This has all been gradual though and there was
never an acute change.  His gait does not fluctuate throughout
the day.  He denies any falls the last 2 weeks.  He does not use
a cane or walker, but needs to support himself with the wall.  
He
has been able to get around still using the T, but today called
for EMS.  Denies weakness, parasthesias, back pain, neck pain or
trauma.  Denies bladder or bowel incontinence.  He denies any
clumsiness in the arms.  Has some chronic sense of calf 
tightness
the last ___ years.  Denies any dizziness.  

Regarding his seizures, he has had about 3 the last month and 
the
last was 3 days ago.  They are simple partial seizures, and he
says that he never loses consciousness with them.  He initially
reported to EMS that he was having increased auras, but now says
he had only one aura this AM, none yesterday and that at times 
he
has multiple auras in one day.  He does not think his auras are
increased anymore, and he's unsure why that was documented as a
complaint earlier today.  Denies any recent changes to his
anti-seizure medications.  He has been on this combination over
the last several years and could not recall the prior 
medications
he took.
He also complained of intermittent diploplia today, but reports
that this is a chronic problem over the last 6 months and has
actually been better than baseline today.  

ROS: Denies any change in cognition and denies word finding
difficulty.  No fevers, chills, neck stiffness or pain.  No
nausea/vomtting or belly pain.

----
CT head:
1. No evidence of intracranial hemorrhage or edema.
2. Asymmetric atrophy of the left caudate head when compared to 
the right. Of note, MRI would be recommended to evaluate for 
structural abnormalities as possible cause for seizures if not 
performed previously.
----
___:
IMPRESSION:
1. Diffuse cerebral and cerebellar atrophy, more than expected 
for the patient's age, may be secondary to chronic Dilantin use, 
although other causes cannot be excluded. Volume loss in the 
cerebellum is congruent with cerebral atrophy.
2. Asymmetry of the cerebral hemispheres with increased atrophy 
involving the left cerebral hemisphere and associated prominence 
of the left lateral ventricle is also of uncertain etiology and 
may be secondary to prior insult. No blood products are noted. 
Gliotic changes are noted along the left insula.
3. No evidence of acute hemorrhage, infarct, or evidence of 
mass.
----
EEG:
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG in the waking and drowsy states due to 
the 
background voltage asymmetry, with lower voltages seen broadly 
over the 
left hemisphere. This suggests either widespread cortical 
dysfunction 
on the left or material interposed between the recording 
electrodes and 
brain surface (e.g. subdural fluid). Otherwise, there were no 
focal 
abnormalities or epileptiform features. A bradycardia was noted. 


 
Brief Hospital Course:
Pt was admitted after becoming acutely ataxic in the setting of 
chronic ataxia.  He was found to have a toxic tegretol level so 
this was held for 1.5 days.  There was no recent medication 
change and no reason was found for his level to have risen.  His 
recent increase in levothyroxine should not have caused this.  
His gait improved while he was here and his tegretol level 
normalized.  An MRI showed his baseline cerebral asymmetry and 
also cerebellar atrophy.  

Based on the cerebellar atrophy and his osteoporosis concerns, 
we decided to change his anticonvulsants.  His Tegretol was 
decreased slightly to 300-400 and Zonegran was added to titrate 
up slowly (he will be on 100 mg daily in 4 weeks, at which point 
further uptitration can be undertaken).  he can then be titrated 
off of the Tegretol.  he was also on low dose Neurontin, which 
was stopped.

He did well and ___ cleared him for D/C with a rolling walker and 
home ___.

---
We changed your medications slightly. Please make sure to take 
the new dose of Tegretol (300 mg in the morning and 400 mg at 
night; this is 1 pill of 100 mg and 1 pill of 200 mg in the 
morning, and 2 pills of 200 mg at night each day).  Also, we 
added a new medication called Zonegran.  This will need to be 
titrated up to a full dose as prescribed.  Please follow this 
prescription as written.

We stopped your neurontin.  Please do not take this any longer.
