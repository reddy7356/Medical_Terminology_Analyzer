Brief Hospital Course:
Patient underwent right carotid endarterectomy on ___ with JP 
drain placement. On the morning of POD1, patient's JP drain fell 
out - however, drain output had been low, so no efforts were

POD1. During the day, she developed some lateral right neck 
fullness, but this was stable throughout the remainder of her 
hospitalization. She was deemed ready for discharge on POD2. At 
the time of discharge, patient's pain was well-controlled on PO 
pain medications; she was voiding, eating, performing activities 
as tolerated without assistance.

Carotid Endarterectomy
Patient Discharge Instructions
 
WHAT TO EXPECT:
Bruising, tenderness, mild swelling, numbness and/or a firm 
ridge at the incision site is normal.  This will improve 
gradually in the next 2 weeks.
 
You may have a sore throat and or mild hoarseness.  Warm tea, 
throat lozenges, or cool drinks usually help.
 
It is normal to feel tired for ___ weeks after your surgery.
 
MEDICATION INSTRUCTIONS:

Before you leave the hospital, you will be given a list of all 
the medicine you should take at home.  If a medication that you 
normally take is not on the list or a medication that you do not 
take is on the list please discuss it with the team!  

It is very important that you take Aspirin every day!  You 
should never stop this medication before checking with your 
surgeon

 You should take Tylenol ___ every 6 hours, as needed for neck 
pain.  If this is not enough, take your prescription pain 
medication.  You should require less pain medication each day.  
Do not take more than a daily total of 3000mg of Tylenol.  
Tylenol is used as an ingredient in some other over-the-counter 
and prescription medications.  Be aware of how much Tylenol you 
are taking in a day.

Narcotic pain medication can be very constipating.  If you take 
narcotics,  please also take a stool softener such as Colace.

___ CT HEAD WITHOUT CONTRAST
No acute intracranial process or hemorrhage. Unchanged right 
parietoccipital encephalomalacia and bilateral chronic small 
vessel ischemic changes. Unchanged encephalomalacia identified 
in the left occipital lobe. 

___ CT ABDOMEN/PELVIS WITHOUT CONTRAST
No acute process within the abdomen or pelvis. Cirrhotic liver.  
Hypodensity in the right lobe of the liver is likely fibrosis, 
but out-patient liver MRI is recommended for further evaluation. 
Cholelithiasis without cholecystitis. Sigmoid diverticulosis 
without diverticulitis. 
Extensive atherosclerotic disease. 

___ CT HEAD WITHOUT CONTRAST
No acute intracranial abnormalities. Unchanged appearance of 
encephalomalacia is as described above. 

___ EEG
This telemetry captured no pushbutton activations. It showed a 
disorganized and slow background throughout, signifying a 
widespread 
encephalopathy affecting cortical and subcortical structures. 
The recording cannot specify the etiology, but infection, 
metabolic disturbances, and medications are among the most 
common causes. There was also additional prominent focal slowing 
broadly over the right hemisphere, indicating persistent focal 
subcortical dysfunction there, possibly structural. There were 
also infrequent but occasionally periodic spike discharges in 
the right occipital area, suggesting an area of potential 
epileptogenesis, but no discharges were rapid or prolonged 
enough to constitute electrographic seizures. 

___ EEG
This telemetry captured no pushbutton activations. It showed a 
slow and disorganized background throughout, with frequent 
bursts of 
generalized slowing or background voltage suppression for a few 
seconds. These findings indicate a moderately severe 
encephalopathy affecting both cortical and subcortical 
structures. Medications, metabolic disturbances, and infection 
abnormal most common causes. Additionally, there was more 
prominent focal delta slowing in the right hemisphere and more 
background suppression there, as well. These findings suggest an 
additional cortical and subcortical dysfunction in the right 
hemisphere, possibly structural. There were also frequent sharp 
waves, occasionally periodic, in the same area indicating an 
area of cortical hypersynchrony and potential epileptogenesis, 
but the sharp waves were not so frequent or rhythmic as to 
suggest ongoing seizures at the time.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ is a ___ with recent carotid endarterectomy, history 
of stroke, and recent admission with altered mental status 
likely secondary to opioid use, now admitted for altered mental 
status, status post generalized tonic clonic seizure most likely 
due to new ischemic and hemorrhagic strokes, now stable on 
Levetiracetam. Her hospital course was complicated by poor 
swallowing function, however ultimately the family and patient 
decided that she did not want a PEG tube for feeding, and the 
patient was taking food and medication orally on discharge with 
supervision.

====================
ACUTE/ACTIVE ISSUES:
====================

# Altered mental status 
# Generalized tonic clonic seizure
# New ischemic and hemorrhagic strokes
The patient had recently been admitted from ___ for AMS, 
thought likely secondary to opioid use, given patient had been 
receiving double her usual dose of oxycodone. Extensive work-up 
at that time was negative, except for elevated TSH of 21. 
Presented to ___ on ___, one day post discharge, with 
persistent altered mental status. Hypothyroidism with TSH up to 
21, with other workup unremarkable. New generalized tonic-clonic 
seizure 4 days after admission, neurology consulted, EEG showed 
right parietal epileptiform discharges, which improved after 
levetiracetam, and she has been maintained on 750 mg twice 
daily. She needed some IV Keppra given her poor PO intake 
(discussed below) but was ultimately able to take PO with no 
further seizure activity. MRI of the brain also showed new 
subacute watershed infarcts, hemorrhage in the right basal 
ganglia, new since ___ but of indeterminate age, and 
thought to be the cause of her seizures and subsequent AMS. Her 
blood pressure was maintainted with a goal systolid ___ per 
neurology. Patient now maintained on aspirin and Plavix, with 
her neurological examination remaining stable.  

# Aspiration risk
# Goals of care
Patient has persistent dysarthria and dysphasia secondary to her 
CVA history, which has worsened with this admission following 
her seizure (likely secondary to her subacute stroke, per 
neurology team). Has been evaluated by Speech and Swallow team, 
but has refused further studies multiple times. Patient had a 
MOLST stating that she does not want feeding tube, but HCP 
(sister) originally wanted to place PEG. Multiple goals of care 
discussions with family and patient, consulted Ethics, resulting 
in patient, HCP, and family in agreement with no feeding tube. 
Despite high aspiration risk, patient has consistently refused 
thickened liquids or crushed medications. In agreement with HCP, 
family, and patient, she is now being supervised with thin 
liquids and whole pills. Has been able to tolerate pills, with 
occasional coughing when drinking thin liquids, but will 
continue with this diet regimen upon discharge due to 
patient/HCP wishes and understanding of high aspiration risk. Of 
note, code status was reaffirmed as full code by both patient 
and HCP. Full code, OK for intubation, OK for tracheostomy as 
well if unable to be weaned from the ventilator.

# Acute kidney injury with chronic kidney disease 
Baseline creatinine reported as 1.4 but may actually be 1.1 per 
review of CHA records. Presented with Cr 1.7, which has 
persisted despite albumin trials. Felt likely pre-renal in 
etiology given poor PO intake per patient and patient's sister, 
but given absence of improvement with 3 days of albumin 
administration, could reflect new baseline kidney function with 
progression of CKD. Home lisinopril was held in the context of 
worsening kidney function and all medications were renally 
dosed. Cr has now remained stable at ~1.3 

# Macrocytic anemia
Hgb on admission 10.0, has now stabilized at 7.6, most likely 
representing losses from persistent bleeding at right upper 
extremity from superficial laceration following patient 
withdrawal of RUE from subcutaneous heparin injection. Hemolytic 
workup was negative. Macrocytic anemia, with folate replenished 
and B12 within normal limits, etiology likely related to 
cirrhosis or hypothyroidism, worsened in the setting of poor PO 
intake. 

# Right upper extremity laceration
Pt sustained superficial laceration on ___ on external aspect 
of right upper extremity following her withdrawal from the nurse 
while nurse was administering subcutaneous heparin injection. 
Laceration required apposition of skin edges with derma-bond but 
bleeding has resolved with pressure dressing. Moderate bruising 
remained without large hematoma formation. 

# Hypertension
Lisionpril 2.5mg held in the setting of ___. Given previous CVA 
history, neurology team recommended SBP goal of 120-160, 
prioritizing avoiding hypotension with patient. Was eventually 
titrated to carvedilol 12.5 BID upon discharge.

# Right lower lobe opacity
Patient is high aspiration risk (see above) and was noted to 
have rhoncerous breath sounds, with CXR revealing RLL opacity. 
Patient was empirically started on cefepime for 1 day (___), 
but soon discontinued because patient had no systemic signs of 
infection (fever, leukocytosis, etc), with opacity likely 
representing atelectasis instead of pneumonia. Patient did not 
have O2 requirement during admission (except at night due to 
likely OSA secondary to stroke), with no shortness of breath 
through admission.

======================
CHRONIC/STABLE ISSUES:
======================

# Right carotid stenosis status post CEA
Patient continued her home aspirin, clopidogrel, and 
atorvastatin. These were discontinued for the period while 
patient was NPO (Aspirin given PR), but patient will now resume 
all 3 medications by mouth upon discharge.

# Hyperlipidemia
Atorvastatin was held as she was NPO, but continued after able 
to take pills by mouth. 

# Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (CHADS2 = 4)
She is scheduled for outpatient follow-up with ___ Cardiology to 
discuss a previous instance of pAF while inpatient at ___ 
___. She was maintained on telemetry while inpatient during 
which time she had occasional runs of atrial tachycardia, though 
she never displayed any atrial fibrillation. Unclear whether 
this even captured at CHA may have been A tach rather than A 
fib. Given this discrepancy, the patient was not discharged on 
anticoagulation. Moreover, the patient's strokes were thought to 
be watershed territory rather than thromboembolic.

====================
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
====================

[] FYI re:goals of care discussion, patient is high aspiration 
risk but is refusing feeding tube. Discharged on regular diet 
with supervision. Occasional coughing with this liquids.
[] Per neurology team, systolic BP goal 160-120, with 
prioritizing avoidance of hypotension. Carvedilol chosen due to 
need for BP control hospitalization. Discharged on Carvedilol 
12.5mg PO BID, continue to uptitrate as needed for BP goal SBP 
120-160
[] Hypothryoidism: Pt's TSH was 21 upon admission; now on 
levothyroxine 150mg BID, re-check TSH in six weeks
[] ___: Patient's Cr 1.7 on admission, now 1.4 despite IVF and 
albumin. ___ represent new baseline, please draw BMP at first 
visit.
[] Reported history of paroxysmal AFib: Monitored on telemetry 
while inpatient with occasional short bursts of atrial 
tachydardia, though no atrial fibrillation. Given this, 
anticoagulation was not started while inpatient.

 MEDICATION CHANGES:
 [] discontinued lisinopril due to your renal function
 [] started levothyroxine 150mcg by mouth daily 
 [] started aspirin 81mg daily
 [] started levitracetam 750mg twice a day
 [] started carvedilol 12.5mg twice a day

blindness. She resides at a skilled nursing facility. She was 
apparently in her usual state of health until yesterday. Her
sister, who is at bedside, reports that the patient made a 
nonsense statement to her but otherwise did not complain of any 
new physical pains. Does note that she has had decreased PO 
intake recently, including decreased fluid intake, though has 
been drinking some given that she enjoys the lemonade at the 
facility. 3 ___ ___ was her last known normal. On evaluation this 
morning, nursing aides noted her to be altered combative, 
agitated, and disoriented. On evaluation in the ED, the patient 
reported that she has had chest pain "for years," and stated she 
has had abdominal pain but cannot say for how long. She did not 
cooperate with questions about her name, orientation. She is 
unable to provide any further details of the history. Records 
from the ___ nursing facility were reviewed and were 
otherwise unrevealing. Of note the patient is on Plavix and 
enoxaparin.

Her labs were notable for mild hyponatremia and mild ___ 
suggestive of dehydration. Her LFTs were notable for mild 
elevation of T bili; right upper quadrant ultrasound was 
negative. Given her recent right CEA, vascular surgery was 
consulted, and obtained carotid Doppler ultrasound at their
recommendation. CT head was obtained which showed no acute 
hemorrhage or large territorial infarction, some evolving small 
vessel disease.

Less than 50% stenosis of the right ICA, according to ___ 
consensus findings. Exam was limited due to patient's altered 
mental status, preventing cooperation and imaging of the left 
common and internal carotid arteries.

___ EXAMINATION:  CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST Q111 CT HEAD
IMPRESSION: 
1. No acute intracranial hemorrhage or acute large vascular 
territorial 
infarction. 
2. Unchanged encephalomalacia in the right parietoccipital lobe 
compatible 
with prior infarct. 
3. Increased right periventricular confluent white matter 
hypodensity likely represents worsening chronic small vessel 
ischemic disease.

Brief Hospital Course:
PATIENT SUMMARY
================
___ with recent carotid endarterectomy admitted for altered 
mental status concerning for acute opioid intoxication. Mental 
status improved to baseline during hospitalization after holding 
opioids and other sedating medications. 

ACUTE ISSUES:
=============
#Acute toxic metabolic encephalopathy
Collateral history from patient's sister and ___ concerning for 
acute opioid intoxication. Held home opioids. Pt improved to 
near baseline. Recommend continuing to hold opioids. 

#Hypothyroidism
Elevated TSH but normal T4. Pt maintained on equivalent home 
levothyroxine dose throughout hospitalization.

___, resolved
Prerenal etiology ___ poor PO intake. Creatinine improved to 
baseline with fluid resuscitation. 

CHRONIC ISSUES:
===============
#R carotid stenosis s/p carotid endarterectomy
Carotid ultrasound imaging showed good flow through right 
carotid artery. Continued home plavix, atorvastatin, Lovenox 
40mg SQ daily

#Atrial fibrillation
In sinus rhythm during admission, though has a history of 
paroxysmal AF per CHA records with planned outpt cardiology. 
Continued home Lovenox 40mg SQ daily.

#Anemia
Asymptomatic, stable, baseline Hgb 10. Iron panel consistent 
with
anemia of chronic inflammation.

#T2DM: Maintained glycemic control with insulin sliding scale.
#HTN: Continued home ACE
#HLD: Continued home atorvastatin 80mg PO daily

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
====================
#Acute toxic metabolic encephalopathy
[]Encourage non-opioid and non-sedating therapies for treatment 
of chronic pain.

#Hypothyroidism
[]Elevated TSH suggests undertreatment of hypothyroidism. Will 
likely need titration of levothyroxine.

#Aortic arch aneurysm, <4cm
[] Needs follow up imaging ___
