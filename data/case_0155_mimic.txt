History of Present Illness:
Mr. ___ is a ___ year old man with hx of CAD s/p CABG, s/p 
pacer insertion, AAA who presented to the ED after his wife 
heard him fall in the bathroom.  EMS was activated by his wife 
and on arrival he was found in to be in ___.  He was shocked 
twice to PEA.  He was given 4mg Epi, 3mg Atropine total.  On

CPR was stopped.  He was intubated in the field.  Total out of 
hospital CPR time was 30 minutes.
.
In the ED, initial BP was 130/62, HR 112.  The post-arrest team 
and cardiology consult were called.  He was given Amiodarone 
150mg bolus with a drip at 1mg/min.  His blood pressures dropped 
to 77/54 and he was started on peripheral dopamine, maxed out at 
20mcg/kg/min.  His blood pressure increased to 92/35, HR 59.  A

Brief Hospital Course:
MEL___, GIB:
Mr. ___ is a ___ yo male with Afib on coumadin and history of 
colonic AVM's and diverticulosis, who presented with black tarry 
stools.  He has had black stools in the past in the setting of 
iron supplementation.  He usually notices that his black stools 
resolve with discontinuation of his iron, although this week his 
stools remained black when he held his iron.  His baseline 
hematocrit is in the low 30's but was 27.3 on admission.  He 
denied NSAID use, dyspepsia, GI upset and recent emesis.
.
On admission, coumadin was held to allow INR to reverse 
coagulopathy for endoscopy and he was given a total of 7.5 mg of 
PO vitamin K. Iron was also held, per GI recommendations. He was 
placed on IV omeprazole. Patient had an EGD on ___ which 
demonstrated an AVM with stigmata of a recent bleed. GI was able 
to apply thermal therapy, however patient decompensated during 
the procedure. He went into A Fib with AVR and his O2 sat 
decreased to the low ___, perhaps ___ aspiration. The procedure 
was stopped and GI was unable to clip the AVM.  Patient was 
observed in the GI suite and evaluated by the MICU. He returned 
to the floor with stable oxygenation. It was decided EGD would 
be repeated with MAC on ___. Patient could not be discharged 
for outpatient MAC EGD because it was felt his stroke risk was 
too high without coagulation for A Fib. Conversely, with 
coagulation his risk of severe upper GI bleed was too high. It 
was decided patient would stay inpatient (off coagulation) until 
the procedure after a discussion with his PCP, ___, and 
family. EGD ___ demonstrated a large AVM with central 
ulceration in the junction of the ___ parts of the duodenum, 
which was cauterized with succesful hemostasis. He will be 
continued indefinitely on twice daily omeprazole until he is 
seen in GI clinic in 4 weeks. Coumadin will be restarted at the 
usual dose on the evening of discharge, and he will be seen by 
home ___ 2 days after discharge for a check of hematocrit and 
INR. He remained hemodynamically stable, with a stable 
hematocrit throughout the admission. He received 1 unit PRBC 
during the hospitalization. He tolerated a regular diet prior to 
discharge. 
.
# Afib: Warfarin held during hospital stay in setting of upper 
GI bleed awaiting EGD. Warfarin will be re-started on ___ 
for therapeutic goal of INR ___, with a follow-up INR to be 
checked 2 days after discharge. Continued rate control with 
digoxin.  
.
# CAD s/p CABG: Statin and ISMN during hospital stay. Not on ASA 
due to allergy. Primary care provider could consider starting 
patient on B-blocker.

and Circumflex ___ pacemaker since ___, multiple falls, iron 
deficiency anemia, spinal stenosis, GI AVMs, and macular

.
#) Altered mental status - Given his acute change in mental 
status, this was concerning for acute delirium on top of 
underlying dementia. Mental status exam, which includes 
inattention, disorientation and disorganized thinking, was 
consistent with delirium.  Neurology was consulted. CT scan of 
his head (MRI is contraindicated in this pt b/c of his 
pacemaker) did not reveal stroke or bleeding, but did reveal new 
left maxillary sinusitis.  Physical exam revealed only mild 
tenderness over his sinuses and nasal congestion. He was 
administered cefpodoxime (10d course; last day is on ___, and 
no signs of an allergic response were noted (pt has allergies to 
penicillin).  We decided not to treat with azithromycin given 
its interaction with both coumadin and digoxin.  Within 24hrs, 
patient showed marked improvement in his mental status.  Per 
family, patient was back at his baseline.  
.
#AFib: Patient was on home regimen of coumdain and digoxin.  We

puncture if his mental status did not improve.  At discharge, 
patient was restarted back on coumadin.  His INR at time of 
discharge was 2.0.
.  
#Thrombocytopenia:  His platelt count was as low as 96 during 
this admission. His platelet count was as high as 151 in ___, and has had decreasing counts since. A cause for his 
thrombocytopenia was not discovered, though it is possible that 
they may currently be suppressed in the setting of a new 
infection.

His other medications were continued per his home regimen.
