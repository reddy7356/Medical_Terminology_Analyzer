Attending: ___.
 
Chief Complaint:
SOB, Chest pain  
 
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

 
History of Present Illness:
This is a ___ year old F with recent diagnosis of bilateral PEs 
with only risk factor of OCPs who is re-admitted with worsening 
chest pain and SOB after being home for 2 days. She was just 
admitted from ___ to ___ after being transferred from ___ 
___ with chest pain. During the admission, she was found to 
be tachycardic and hypoxic with an elevated d-dimer and CTA 
showing bilateral PEs (with report of large clot burden) and 
infarction of segment of R lung. ECHO showed RV cavity 
enlargement with low normal free wall motion and ECG showed 
question of new RBBB. She was treated with 80 mg Lovenox SC BID 
and started on coumadin which she states that she has been 
compliant.  
.  
She was feeling well the day after discharge requiring very 
minimal pain med and this morning she woke up at 1:30 AM with 
worsening chest pain. The pain is pleuritic in nature and 
primarily R sided. This is very similar to original PE pain 
presentation, but lesser in intensity ___ instead of ___. She 
feels it is improved with moving around as she often splints 
when she sits still. She denies having any other associated 
symptoms, no pain on her calf, no shortness of breath, no 
palptations, no diaphoresis, no n/v, no other complaints except 
for short episode of lightheadedness this morning while she was 
sitting up, only lasted a few seconds and went away. As she was 
concerned about her recent presentation and worsening of her 
pain, she came in to the ED for evaluation.  
.  
In the ED, initial vs were: T 99.6 110 124/71 20 100% on RA. 
Patient was given dilaudid 2 mg PO x1 and was started on a 
heparin gtt for anticoagulation in place of lovenox per ED 
attending. She states that Dilaudid helps decrease the pain, but 
doesn't go way completely.  
.  
On the floor, her vitals are stable. She appears uncomfortable 
sitting up in bed. She is taking shallow breaths due to pain.  
.  
Review of sytems:  
(+) Per HPI  
(-) Denies fever, chills, night sweats, recent weight loss or 
gain. Denies headache, sinus tenderness, rhinorrhea or 
congestion. Denied cough, palpitations. Denied nausea, vomiting, 
diarrhea, constipation or abdominal pain. No recent change in 
bowel or bladder habits. No dysuria. Denied arthralgias or 
myalgias, or calf pain.

Chest CTA
Final Report 
INDICATION: ___ woman with recent severe bilateral PE, 
now with 
increased pain, query progression of clot despite being on 
anticoagulation. 
  
COMPARISON: ___ study from ___. 
  
TECHNIQUE: Multiple MDCT axial images were obtained through the 
chest after 
the uneventful administration of 100 cc of Optiray 
intravenously. Enteric 
contrast was not administered. Multiplanar reformats were 
derived. 
  
FINDINGS: There is no axillary or mediastinal pathologic 
lymphadenopathy.  
The pulmonary artery measures 2.1 cm, normal. No new pulmonary 
embolus is 
seen and the thrombus burden is apparently decreased from before 
with 
non-artery enlarging thrombus seen in the arteries to the 
posterior segment of 
the right lower lobe. The aorta is normal in caliber and course. 
The heart 
is normal in size. There is no pericardial effusion. The 
esophagus appears 
normal. 
  
Airways are patent to the level of subsegmental bronchi. There 
are new 
bilateral pleural effusions, larger on the right where there is 
associated 
relaxation atelectasis. There is a 4mm nodule in the right 
middle lobe ___ 
2, image 38). There is no pneumothorax. Mild air trapping is 
seen in both 
lower lobes. 
  
This study is not optimized to assess the abdomen. Within this 
limitation, 
the liver and spleen appear normal. There is no suspicious 
osteolytic or 
osteoblastic lesion. 
  
IMPRESSION:  
1. Improved appearance with no new pulmonary embolus. Small 
residual 
segmental emboli, right lower lobe.  
2. New pleural effusions are larger on the right with associated 
relaxation 
atelectasis. 
3. Right pulmonary nodules. If low risk no follow required. If 
high risk 
then , per ___ Society guidelines, 12month follow up 
required. 
  
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

.
Final Report 
INDICATION: Chest pain. 
  
COMPARISON: None available. 
  
FINDINGS: PA and lateral views of the chest show the lungs to be 
clear.  
Cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours are normal. There no 
pleural 
effusions or pneumothorax. A faint opacity projecting 
posteriorly over the 
right hemidiaphragm may reflect a small eventration or Bochdalek 
hernia, 
though a pulmonary consolidation is also a consideration. 
  
IMPRESSION: Posterior density over the right hemidiaphragm. This 
may reflect 
a Bochdalek hernia, though a pulmonary opacity is also a 
consideration. 
  
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist. 

  
___. ___ 
___. ___ 
___: WED ___ 7:46 ___ 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ with recent diagnosis of b/l PEs with large clot burden, 
infarcted lung segement, on lovenox and coumadin recently d/c'd 
who is presenting with worsening pleuritic chest pain, 
hemodynamically stable on RA, sx likely due to premature 
termination of her home pain meds, but initially concerning for 
clot progression while on lovenox.  
.  
# Chest Pain: Likely secondary to pulmonary PEs, give it is 
pleuritic and similar to original pain on presentation with 
lower intensity. This could be due to either reperfusion, 
infarction of the tissue, or pleural irritation from clot 
destruction. Patient states that she was compliant with 
anticoagulation and had been taking lovenox and coumadin as 
prescribed. Her INR is 1.5 on admission. She may have stopped 
taking her home pain meds prematurely however, but initially 
this was also concerning for progression of emboli despite 
anticoagulation. A repeat CTA showed decrease in clot burden and 
no new findings aside from previous segmental infarction. Also 
showed some small pulmonary nodules which may be followed up as 
an outpatient in 12 months if the patient is considered to be 
high risk based on ___ guidelines, otherwise they 
do not need followup. She was sent home with instructions to 
manage her pain with dilaudid po prn and standing ibuprofen. 
.  
# Bilateral PEs: No clear reason to discontinue lovenox. 
However, progression of clot burden is a possibility. Data 
suggests that in hemodynamically stable patients, SC lovenox is 
preferred over UFH and results in lower mortality, decreased 
recurrent thrombosis as well as better thrombus size reduction. 
A repeat CTA did not show any progression of embolic disease (no 
concern for failure on lovenox) and the patient was ultimately 
therapeutic on her coumadin which she was discharged on (5mg 
daily) to be followed up by her PCP in clinic in the coming 
week. 
.  
# Gingivostomitis: has h/o labial cold sores. now with apparent 
flare causing discomfort. she was sent home with PO acyclovir 
400 q8 for HSV 1 treatment ___
.

     CT TORSO
      
     CLINICAL HISTORY:  Right rib and flank pain.
      
     TECHNIQUE:  CT of the torso was performed, with imaging of 
the chest
     obtained using pulmonary angiogram technique, and imaging 
of the
     abdomen and pelvis obtained both prior to and after the 
administration
     of IV contrast.  100 cc of Omnipaque-300 was administered 
for this
     examination.  Multiplanar reformations were also reviewed 
at the time
     of interpretation.
      
     No comparisons.
      
     FINDINGS:
      
     CTA CHEST:  Examination of vascular structures demonstrates 
bilateral
     pulmonary emboli, with a relatively large burden of 
thrombus seen
     predominantly within the bilateral lower lobe basal 
segments.  There
     is essentially occlusive appearance of right basilar lower 
lobe medial
     segment with consolidation peripheral to this suggesting 
the presence
     of a pulmonary infarct within this segment.  Thrombus is 
also seen
     proximally within the right middle lobe pulmonary artery, 
within the
     left lower lobe pulmonary artery, and with relative 
preservation of
     the upper lobe pulmonary arteries.
      
     CT CHEST WITH CONTRAST:
      
     Examination of soft tissue windows demonstrates no 
axillary,
     mediastinal, or hilar lymphadenopathy.  
      
     Examination of lung windows again demonstrates elevation in 
the right
     lower lobe basal posterior pulmonary artery segment, 
consistent with
     pulmonary embolism given the thrombus filling the blood 
vessels
     supplying this region.  No concerning pulmonary nodules are 
otherwise
     seen.  
      
     CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITHOUT AND WITH IV CONTRAST:
      
     The liver, gallbladder, pancreas, spleen, adrenal glands, 
and kidneys
     appear unremarkable.  There is no abdominal lymphadenopathy 
or free
     fluid.

Final Report 
REASON FOR ___: History of pulmonary embolism. Clinical concern 
for deep 
venous thrombosis. 
  
COMPARISON: None. 
  
TECHNIQUE: Grayscale and Doppler ultrasound images of bilateral 
lower 
extremity veins were obtained. 
  
FINDINGS: Bilateral common femoral veins, superficial femoral 
veins, 
popliteal veins demonstrate normal compressibility, flow, and 
augmentation.  
Bilateral posterior tibial and peroneal veins are patent. 
  
IMPRESSION: No deep venous thrombosis within bilateral lower 
extremities. 
  
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

ECHO
Conclusions  
The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. Left 
ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and regional/global 
systolic function are normal (LVEF >55%). The estimated cardiac 
index is normal (>=2.5L/min/m2). The right ventricular cavity is 
mildly dilated with borderline normal free wall function. The 
diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels are 
normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal 
with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The 
mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral 
regurgitation. There is no mitral valve prolapse. There is 
borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no 
pericardial effusion. 

IMPRESSION: Mild right ventricular cavity enlargement with low 
normal free wall motion. Borderline pulmonary artery systolic 
hypertension. 

CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: 
Based on ___ AHA endocarditis prophylaxis recommendations, the 
echo findings indicate prophylaxis is NOT recommended. Clinical 
decisions regarding the need for prophylaxis should be based on 
clinical and echocardiographic data.   
  Electronically signed by ___, MD, Interpreting 
physician ___ ___ 15:___ yo F on OCP and recent limited mobility of left leg with 
large bilateral PEs and pulmonary infarction.  
.  
# PE: Only discernible risk factor is OCP. Left ankle sprain 
resulted in some temporary limited mobility of that leg. No 
family hx. She was hemodynamically stable although initially 
tachycardic at OSH in setting of uncontrolled pain. On EKG, 
unclear whether RBBB is new, if so, would reflect RV strain. 
ECHO shows mild right ventricular cavity enlargement with low 
normal free wall motion. Borderline pulmonary artery systolic 
hypertension. LENIs were negative for DVT. The pt was started on

outpatient. She was also treated with prn dilaudid PO and 
standing tylenol/ibuprofen for her pain (due to infarction of a 
segment in the right lung).
