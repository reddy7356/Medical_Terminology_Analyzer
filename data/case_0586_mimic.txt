History of Present Illness:
___ yr old F patient with hx of LAD stent in ___ (at ___ and 
severe COPD on 2L NC at home who presented to ___ on ___ 
with sob,. Per patient and ___ records she has had COPD and 
is on 2L NC at home. She can normally walk to her bathroom

breath and needs to stop and rest for awhile. On ___ she 
was feeling even more short of breath than usual and her famliy 
brought her to ___. She had no white count, a trop of 0.06, 
and CXR showed right basilar patchy consolidation thought ot be 
pneumonitis and mild failure per radiologist at ___. 
 She was admitted and started on levoqiuon for pneumonia. She 
was also started on nebs, IV solumedrol for COPD exacerbation. 
She was also diuresed with IV lasix for presumed mild diastolic 
heart failure exacerbation.
 She was then seen by cardiologist (dr. ___ in consultation 
who recommended that dyspnea may be ___ unstable angina not CHF 
since BNP was 176 on admission and they d/cd the lasix. (also 
patients creatinine increased to 1.6 on lasix). He felt she 
needed urgent cath for possible unstable angina. on ___ had 
P- mibi showing mild middle to basal lateral wall ischemia with

pain that she relates to anxiety. She says she has had this off 
and on since the stent was put in in ___. It is left-sided, not 
associated with exertion, occurs at rest, does not radiate. 
Currently she is experiencing it off and on with the nitro patch 
on. She also reports she is at baseline SOB for her. Otherwise

had a 90% ostial stenosis.
2. Limited resting hemodynamics revealed moderate systemic 
arterial
hypertension, with an SBP of 163 mm Hg.
.
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:    
1. One vessel coronary artery disease.
.
CXR ___: 
1. Hyperinflation in a pattern consistent with clinical history 
of COPD.
2. Chronic lingular opacification without evidence of pneumonia.
3. Left pleural convexity may be loculated effusion but followup 
within 2
weeks, then to resolution recommended; otherwise CT necessary to

intervals, Qw III, avf, LVH. No ST/TW changes.
.
EKG pre-cath at ___: NSR at 85bpm, Nl axis, LVH, QW III, aVF. 
No ST/TW changes.

 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ F with severe COPD on home O2 and CAD s/p NSTEMI with DES 
to LAD in ___ admitted to ___ with multi-factorial SOB 
possibly related to cardiac ischemia/unstable angina now s/p 
cardiac cath which revealed prior LAD stent patent and 90% 
stenotic OM2 lesion but small and unlikely to be helped by 
stenting so interventional team recommended medical management 
of coronary disease.
  
.  
# CORONARIES:  S/P NSTEMI in ___ s/p DES to LAD in ___.  Cath 
at ___ on ___ showed no intervenable lesions (see pertinent 
results) and she was managed medically with ___, 
simvastatin 40mg.  Of note, her imdur dose was increased from 
30mg to 60mg daily post-cath for anginal sx which were improved 
at time of discharge.  She remained chest-pain free throughout 
the day of ___ and we felt she was clear for discharge from a 
cardiac standpoint.  
.
#Shortness of breath:  Pt with significant baseline COPD and 
likely contributing to her SOB at ___.  Patient 
remained tachypenic with increased work of breathing throughout 
her admission, but she says this is her baseline and that she 
felt back to normal.  Her PCP's office was contacted and 
confirmed her baseline of increased work of breathing.  We 
continued her on albuterol/ipratroprium nebs for COPD.  Upon 
transfer from ___, she was on PO solumederol at 60mg q6h.  
Given that this high dose was not chronic for her, we quickly 
tapered her to prednisone 60mg daily, and discharged her with 
instructions to decrease her dose by 10mg every 5 days.  This 
seems congruent with the predinsone dosing she was started on at 
her PCP's office in early ___.  Of note, she was started on 
levoquin 750mg PO q48 hrs at ___ for COPD 
exacerbation as well as a presumed pna given her left lingular 
opacity.  However, this is chronic for her and has been followed 
with intermittent CTs and CXRs as an outpatient and has 
apparently remained stable. We sent her out on levoquin to 
complete this course through ___.  Repeat CXR at ___ was 
notable for an additional left pleural convexity which may be 
loculated effusion but could also be concerning for malignancy.  
The radiologists recommended followup for this within 2 weeks, 
then to resolution.  If no resolution, a CT may be necessary to 
further characterize. Of note patient refusing any pulmonary 
rehab or ___ and insisting on taking care of herself at home as 
she feels back to her baseline.
.
# PUMP:  Has diastolic CHF with EF 65% on recent imaging. Likely 
had some component of CHF exacerbation on admission to ___ 
but remained euvolemic at ___.  I/Os were monitored as were 
daily weights.  She was on a low salt diet.  No diuresis was 
required
.  
# RHYTHM:  NSR.  Monitored on tele
.  
#  Chronic renal insufficiency (1.3-1.5 baseline at ___: She 
remained within her baseline during admission.

.  
#Dispo:  Pt refusing pulmonary rehab or home ___ at the time of 
discharge, but we feel that this should be readdressed as an 
outpatient as she would likely benefit from it.

FINDINGS: There is persistent collapse of the lingula. There has 
been 
interval development of bibasilar patchy opacification and 
increased left 
retrocardiac opacification, nonspecific, could relate to 
aspiration pneumonia 
or atelectasis. No other areas of focal parenchymal

effusions or 
pneumothorax. 
  
IMPRESSION: Chronic lingular collapse. Interval development of 
non-specific 
bibasilar patchy opacification which could be related to 
atelectasis, 
aspiration or pneumonia.  

___ CXR pa/lateral
 
FINDINGS: In comparison with the earlier study of this date, 
there is some 
decreased opacification in the bibasilar areas. This could

breath. The patient exercised for 8 minutes of a RAMP protocol 
and 
stopped for shortness of breath and fatigue. The estimated peak 
MET 
capacity was 2 which represents a limited physical working 
capacity for 
her age. No arm, neck, back, or chest discomfort was reported by 
the 
patient throughout the study. There were no significant ST 
segment 
changes during exercise or in recovery. The rhythm was sinus 
with no 
ectopy. Blunted HR and BP response to exercise on beta blocker 
therapy. 
IMPRESSION: Limited functional capacity. No anginal type 
symptoms or 
ischemic EKG changes. Nuclear report sent separately.

HISTORY: ___ y/o female with h/o PCI to LAD ___, COPD 
presenting for 
evaluation of shortness of breath. 
  
SUMMARY OF DATA FROM THE EXERCISE LAB: 
  
Exercise protocol: RAMP 
Resting heart rate: 78 
Resting blood pressure: 140/60 
Exercise Duration: 8 min 
Peak heart rate: 84 
Percent maximum predicted heart rate obtained: 60 %  
Peak blood pressure: 154/74 
Symptoms during exercise: None 
Reason exercise terminated: Fatigue and shortness of breath 
ECG findings: No ischemic ST changes 
  
METHOD: 
  
Resting perfusion images were obtained with Tc-99m sestamibi. 
Tracer was 
injected approximately 45 minutes prior to obtaining the resting 
images. 
  
At peak exercise, approximately three times the resting dose of 
Tc-99m sestamibi 
was administered IV. Stress images were obtained approximately 
15 minutes 
following tracer injection. 
  
Imaging Protocol: Gated SPECT 
  
This study was interpreted using the 17-segment myocardial 
perfusion model. 
  
INTERPRETATION: 
  
The image quality is adequate. 
  
Left ventricular cavity size is normal. 
  
Resting and stress perfusion images reveal uniform tracer uptake 
throughout the 
left ventricular myocardium. 
  
Gated images reveal normal wall motion. 
  
The calculated left ventricular ejection fraction is 64 %. 
  
There are no prior studies. 
 
IMPRESSION: 1. Normal myocardial perfusion at the level of 
exercise achieved. 
2. Normal left ventricular cavity size. 3. LVEF 64%. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ with h/o cardiac risk factors of HTN, HL, former smoker, 
and known CAD s/p DES to mid LAD in ___, also with Grade I 
(mild) LV diastolic dysfunction, COPD, hypothyroidism presents 
with substernal chest pain.  
 
1. Chest pain: Chest pain was thought to be UA vs non cardiac 
cause (pleurisy from viral infection, pneumonia, COPD 
exacerbation/bronchitis, or chostochondritis from excessive 
coughing as pt was noted to have particularly impressive 
coughing fits, and chest pain was elicited from pressing her 
chest). 

Pt was started on Nitro and Hep gtt, given ___, statin. 
Lisinopril and Metoprolol initially held but restarted by 
discharge. Pt ruled out MI with two negative enzymes and 
reassuring EKG. Pt was given nebulizer treatments scheduled, 
however no systemic steroids or ABx, and continued home 
Fluticasone. Pt had exercise mibi (report above) which was 
significant for very poor exercise tolerance ___ METS) however 
was reassuring by EKG and nuclear imaging. Pt had no further 
episodes of chest pain through her admission. 

2. Lingula opacity: Needs to be followed up. It appears from 
last Pulm notes that she was not very compliant and may have 
been lost to follow up. Seen on CT chest ___ and appeared to 
be more benign in appearance than malignant. The pt was offered 
an appt with Pulmonology however stated she wanted her PCP to 
set one up closer to home. 

3. Chronic renal failure: Cr 1.2 on admission with unclear 
baseline, only other OMR value was 1.4 previously. Cr rose 
through admission to 1.6 however came back down to 1.4 by 
discharge. Will need to be followed up but likely baseline is 
1.2-1.4.
