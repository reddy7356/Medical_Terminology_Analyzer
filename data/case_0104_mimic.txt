X ray 
IMPRESSION:
1. Right lower lobe opacity, favoring atelectasis, increased in 
conspicuity
when compared to prior radiographs dating back to ___. Given
the longstanding nature of this finding, a CT for further 
investigation may be
warranted, particularly to exclude the possibility of an 
endobronchial lesion.
2. Interval resolution of opacity in the left mid lung.
===
INDICATION: ___ man with chest pain. Rule out PE and 
dissection.
 
TECHNIQUE: CTA chest without and with IV contrast.
 
COMPARISONS: None.
 
CTA CHEST: There is mild cardiomegaly. There are atherosclerotic
calcifications of the coronary arteries. There is no evidence of 
aortic
dissection. There is normal filling of the pulmonary arterial 
vasculature
without evidence of pulmonary embolism. Evaluation of 
subsegmental branches
is limited due to patient motion.
 
There is no pericardial effusion. There is right lower lobe 
rounded
atelectasis with tethering of the pleura and proliferation of 
adjacent fat
suggesting chronicity. There is moderate centrilobular emphysema 
with upper
lobe predominance, more severe in the right lung. The esophagus 
is patulous.
There is a small axial hiatal hernia. Small mediastinal nodes do 
not meet
size criteria for pathologic enlargement. Non-contrast images 
through the
upper abdomen do not reveal any acute abnormalities. The patient 
is status
post cholecystectomy.
 
BONE WINDOWS: Patient is status post midline sternotomy. No 
suspicious lytic
or sclerotic lesions are identified.
 
IMPRESSION:
 1. No evidence of aortic dissection. No evidence of PE. 
Evaluation of
subsegmental branches is limited due to patient motion.
 2. Discoid opacity in the right lower lobe with pleural 
tethering, probably
representing rounded atelectasis. A followup chest CT in 6 
months is
recommended to assess stability.
 3. Moderate centrilobular emphysema with upper lobe 
predominance, more severe
in the right lung.

CATH
COMMENTS:     
1.  Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system
revealed 2 vessel coronary artery disease.  The LMCA had no
angiographically apparent flow limiting epicardial coronary 
artery
disease.  The LAD had a 90% stenosis at the origin which was 
supplied by
the ___.  The ___ had a patent stent.  The RCA was totally 
occluded at
the origin with a distal segment which filled by collaterals.
2.  Arterial conduit angiography revealed an LIMA-LAD which was 
patent
with diffuse distal disease and a patent distal stent.  The 
SVG-RCA was
completely occluded.
3.  Resting hemodynamics revealed normal systemic arterial 
systolic and
diastolic blood pressures with SBP 132 mmHg and DBP 60 mmHg.
 
 
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:    
1. Two vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Normal systemic arterial systolic and diastolic blood 
pressures.
===
Upper endoscopy ___
Findings:
Esophagus:Normal esophagus.
Stomach:
Lumen:Evidence of a previous sub-total gastrectomy with 
gastrojejunal anastomosis was seen. Both limbs of the BII were 
explored without any pathology.  
Mucosa:Mild erythema of the mucosa was noted at the 
anastomosis. Cold forceps biopsies were performed for histology 
at the anastomosis. 
Impression:Previous sub-total gastrectomy of the stomach
Erythema at the anastomosis (biopsy)
Otherwise normal EGD to both limbs of gastrojejunostomy
Recommendations:Return to inpt ward
Follow-up biopsies
Additional notes:No source for the patient's symptoms was found 
on this exam. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: Pt is ___ yo m with CAD s/p MI, s/p CABG, s/p stents, HTN, 
DM, h/o GIB, p/w intermittent chest pain and EtOH intoxication.
.
#) Chest pain: Pt with extensive cardaic history, so at 
high-risk for ischemic pain. Currently in ___ chest pain. His 
current chest pain is not exertional in nature but still high 
risk given his report that it migh be similar to prior chest 
pain when he required intervention. CTA r/o PE or disection. He 
also was noticed to have dinamic t wave changes on v1-v2. 
Heparin IV and plavix load were given. Cardiology was consulted. 
Given history of stopping aspirin and plavix 4 months ago, and 
description of similar symptoms with prior anginal episodes, 
there was concern for possible stent stenosis - patient was 
taken for elective cardiac catheterization. Cardiac cath showed 
patent stent.  Aspirin and plavix were continued. Imdur was 
added to his antianginal regimen. Patient always complaint of 
burning sensation mid chest associated with epigastriac 
abdominal pain. Given the negative cardiac work up, a GI 
evaluation was performed as below
.
# Abdominal pain: Patient also complained of abdominal pain, 
worse day after cardiac catheterization. His physical exam was 
always benign. IV morphine was used initially, but patient 
persitently ask for more pain medications given worsening pain. 
LFT's, amilase, lipase were normal. Pain medications were 
changed to Morphine PO standing dose obtaining improvement in 
pain control.

Given unexplained etiology of abdominal and chest discomfort and 
also to help in the decision of continuation of plavix and 
aspirin (given history of GI bleeding per patient report without 
clear work up) an upper endoscopy was obtained. It showed 
previous sub-total gastrectomy of the stomach and erythema at 
the anastomosis (biopsy). No other abnormalities were found.
.
By time of discharge patient pain was well control with morphine 
po, PPi and sucralfate.
.
#) DM: patient was monitor on insulin sliding scales.
.
#) h/o GIB: HCT remained stable during his admission. Guiac 
negative on admission. 
.
#) HTN: stable. Ace inhibitor and betablockers were continued.
.
#) Psych: at OSH, he had been on ___ for depression and 
EtOh abuse.  Patient  denied suicidal ideation here. he states 
that he would never consider killing himself despite the 
problems he has at home. Since he was transferred to ___ on 
___, psychiatric service was consulted.
No evidence of suicidal ideation was found and ___ was 
lifted. Recomendations were to continue with current psych meds 
and outpatient follow up.
.
# Anemia: microcitic anemia. Iron studies revealed normal values 
except for low ferritin. Reviewing past records, his hcts ___ 
___ has been int he mid 30's with low MCV. His reticulocite 
count corrected for his hct is in the low side and suggest low 
BM response. This in combination of low platelets and leukopenia 
may warrant further hematology work up.

#Leukopenia: Last WBC 3 on discharge. CBC should be checked on 
his next visit to check for stability.

Brief Hospital Course:
Patient is a ___ y/p M with CAD s/p CABG and multiple stents 
(last ___ at ___, Cypher (2.5x18mm) drug eluting stent) 
presenting with sudden onset CP, abdominal pain w/o significant 
EKG changes.  
.  
#. CAD (chest and abdominal pain): given extensive history 
patient was initially tx w/ heparin gtt with concern for ACS.  
Upon further history obtained after admission, and given 
relative hypotension ___ 95mmHg) and hx of GIBs and atypical 
nature of the pain (unrelieved, radiating to abdomen, no 
diaphoresis, n/v, response to morphine and dialudid), his 
heparin was discontinued.  His CEs were negative x2 (troponins < 
0.01) and his CKs remained < 67.  PE was felt to be unlikely 
given no risk factors and his ambulatory saturation was > 97%.  
It is possible that this is representation of his angina off his 
medications, thus he was restarted on his home regimen, 
including isosorbide mononitrate.  He was also continued on ASA, 
Statin, BB.  His Plavix was continued as well and a decision to 
discontinue this was deferred to primary cardiologist, Dr. 
___.  Alternatively, this may be related to his abodminal 
pain (see below).  For pain, patient received his methadone, 
20mg x1, as well as one dose of PO morphine, 20mg.  His pain 
improved signficantly.  He had no DOE with ambulation.  His PPI 
was increased to BID dosing.    
.  
# Abdominal pain. Patient w/ hx of GERD, hiatal hernia and 
gastritis in the past, not taking his medications. Also has 
chronic abd. pain due to pancreatic atrophy due to EtOH abuse 
which is likely contributing. Most likely pain is hiatal hernia 
and gastritis. No evidence of GIB currently, HCT at baseline per 
PCP ___ 34, never required transfusions. His PPI was increased to 
BID, he was continued on Sucralfate 1g QID.  His LFTs were wnl, 
as was his amylase and lipase.  His abdominal exam at time of 
discharge was benign.  Follow up with GI was arranged for him.
.  
# Anemia, microcytic, chronic. HCT remained within 30 - 31 
range.  Hx due to poor absorption s/p gastrectomy. Hx of wt. 
loss is concerning for colon cancer or another malignancy. EGD 
last year showing gastritis only. Guiac negative. Unlikely to 
have good absorption of PO Fe given sucralfate and gastrectomy. 
CXR w/o evidence of malignancy.  He will likely require 
intravenous Fe infusions, Fe studies were pending at time of 
discharge and will require follow up (discussed with PCP), 
however his ferritin in ___ was 23.  He will require age 
appropriate cancer screeening, including repeat colonoscopy for 
his weight loss.  
. 
#. Depression / Anxiety. Appeared euthymic and without suicidal 
ideation. He was continued on sertraline, trazadone, clonazepam. 
    
.  
#. Chronic pain syndrome. Abdominal source. Pain Meds confirmed 
Community Health Care ___, pt 1770. Discussed w/ PCP 
(seen patient once, Cardiology and GI) doctors. Patient w/ very 
fragmented care and has hx of drug seeking behavior.  
One dose of PO morphine while inpatient, resumed methadone.    
.  
#. HL: Restarted statin.  Lipid status currently unknown.     
.  
#. HTN: Was hypertensive on admission, however this normalized 
with restartof  lisnipril, isosorbide, in addition to BB.  Had 
transient episode of asymptomatic hypotension.    
.  
#. DM2: Continued on lantus and HISS, held neurontin given 
episode lightheadedness which can be SE, however restarted at 
time of discharge.  This lightheadedness wil require outpatient 
evaluation.    
.  
#. BPH: Continued tamsulosin.
