of diarrhea daily with bright red blood. 

ACUTE/ACTIVE PROBLEMS:
# Rectal Bleeding
# Persistent Diarrhea: Patient is well-known to me from her 
prior hospitalization.  At that time she presented with 
abdominal pain, rectal bleeding, and diarrhea.  During her 
hospitalization she had minimal stool output and no rectal 
bleeding.  In that setting a colonoscopy was deferred by GI.  
Reassuringly her imaging was without any evidence of bowel 
inflammation.  Given her persistence of symptoms with now 
extending beyond the month she is in the category for persistent 
diarrhea.  The patient underwent a colonoscopy on ___ which was 
notable for linear ulcerations in the rectum for which biopsies 
were obtained and were unremarkable.  The remainder of the 
colonic mucosa was unremarkable.  Her diet was advanced and she 
reported persistence of diarrhea with normal labs.  Twice daily 
psyllium wafers were introduced with improvement in her symptoms 
as a bulking agent.  She will have both PCP and outpatient GI 
follow-up.

# Epigastric abdominal Pain: The patient has epigastric 
abdominal pain that is associated with nausea and vomiting.  
Particularly with p.o. intake.  This may represent her 
gastroparesis versus peptic ulcer disease.  She has no evidence 
of active bleeding.  She was encouraged to eat small meals and 
was continued on her home promotility agents as well as her home 
PPI and ranitidine.  Her pain was controlled with liquid 
Tylenol. 

# Chronic stable Asthma
- Continued home albuterol and fluticasone furoate inhaler.

# Depression: 
- Continued home aripirazole 20mg qhs, citalopram 40mg qhs,
quetiapine 100mg qhs 

# ADHD: 
- Continued home Adderall XR 60mg daily

# Hypothyroidism: 
- Continued home levothyroxine 75mcg daily, TSH 1.4

# Chronic migraine: 
- Hold homed naratriptan 1mg daily:PRN as non formulary

# GERD: 
- Continued home omeprazole 40mg daily, and ranitidine 300mg qhs

# Epilepsy: 
- Continued home topiramate 100mg daily

# Allergic rhinitis: 
- Continued home loratidine 10mg daily

TRANITIONAL ISSUES:
[] The patient was provided with a work letter as the patient's 
mother reported that she would be unable to return to work while 
having diarrhea.  The work letter is through her follow-up 
appointment.  Please evaluate the ability to return to work.
[] Please monitor nausea as well as diarrhea.  To date 
infectious workup has been unrevealing for her diarrhea as well 
as a normal colonoscopy (with exception of small linear 
ulcerations) and normal biopsies.  She is currently on psyllium 
wafers twice daily as a stool bulking agent.

Greater than 30 minutes was spent in care coordination and 
counseling on the day fo discharge.

WITH SKIN
      AND/OR GENITAL CONTAMINATION. 

IMAGING:
========
CT A/P ___:
No acute process within the abdomen pelvis.  Specifically, no CT 
evidence of active inflammation in the small or large bowel.  If 
there is persistent clinical concern for inflammatory bowel 
disease, MR enterography on an outpatient basis would be more 
sensitive for assessment. 
 
Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ is a ___ year old lady with past medical history 
most notable for gastroparesis and GERD, who presents with a 2 
week episode of diarrhea, initially watery then bloody, nausea, 
vomiting, and inability to keep down PO. Her other medical 
history is notable for autism spectrum disorder, and epilepsy.

# Bloody Diarrhea, likely infectious
Unclear if this represents acute diarrhea versus continuation of 
prior episode >2 weeks ago which would place her in the 
persistent diarrhea category. Initially had planned for 
inpatient colonoscopy, but she had no further episodes of 
diarrhea while in house. Spontaneous resolution suggests 
possible protracted gasteroenteritis of viral or bacterial 
etiology. Stool cultures were negative (though campylobacter 
pending on discharge). C diff was negative. CRP of 13 and ESR in 
normal range could be consistent with infectious process. CT A/P 
without evidence of enteritis or colitis, and, this, in 
conjunction with rapid improvement, lowers suspicion for IBD- 
although we note that study was without oral contrast. Ischemic 
colitis less likely given young age. At this time, yield of 
inpatient colonoscopy is low, and she will need to follow up 
with GI as an outpatient. Patient had 2 episodes of loose stool 
on day of discharge which was thought likely due to resuming a 
regular diet.

# Nausea, vomiting
# Gastroparesis Flare
Patient with known history of gastroparesis. Initially home 
erythromycin held, restarted on D1 of hospitalization, increased 
to BID on day of discharge. She required intermittent zofran for 
nausea and ultimately IV, then PO reglan, which she will 
continue at home for ___ days. At time of discharge she was 
advanced to a gastroparesis diet which she tolerated well. 

===============
CHRONIC ISSUES:
===============
# Asthma: Continued home albuterol. Home fluticasone furoate 
inhaler (non-formulary).
# Depression: Continued home aripirazole 20mg qhs, citalopram 
40mg qhs, quetiapine 100mg qhs 
# ADHD: Continue home Adderall XR 60mg daily
# Hypothyroidism: Continued home levothyroxine 75mcg daily, TSH 
1.4
# Chronic migraine: Held home naratriptan 1mg daily:PRN as 
nonformulary
# GERD: Continued home omeprazole 40mg daily, ranitidine 300mg 
qhs
# Seizure d/o: Continued home topiramate 100mg daily
# Allergic rhinitis: Continued home loratidine 10mg daily
# Chronic constipation: Held home docusate i/s/o diarrhea

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
====================
[] Follow up with GI as outpatient
[] F/u campylobacter stool culture
[] Increased erythromycin to 250 mg BID
[] We note that patient reports taking excedrin daily, which may 
contribute to medication overuse headache. The risk of this was 
discussed with patient. 
[] Note patient on multiple QTc prolonging medications; QTc at 
discharge 438

Greater than 30 minutes was spent in care coordination and 
counseling on the day of discharge.
