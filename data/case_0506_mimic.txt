became lightheaded and fell. She denies any LOC or head strike. 
She has had intermittent palpitations for several years and has

- In the ED, initial vitals were: 6 97.4 92 116/66 16 95% 2L.  
- Labs significant for WBC 19.0 with 88% neutrophils and glucose 
of 251. Normal LFT's, trop, lipase, and electrolytes.  
- UA with 8 WBC and small leuk esterase. Urine culture pending.  

- She had a CT head and C-spine which showed no acute 
abnormalities.  
- She had a CT of her left upper extremity which showed a 
comminuted and displaced proximal left humerus fracture and two 
4mm nodules along the periphery of the left upper lobe.  
- The patient was seen by Orthopedic surgery who recommended use 
of a sling and non weight bearing status with follow up in ___ 
clinic at one week.  
 
- The patient subsequently had an episode of tachycardia to the 
170s and was lightheaded and hypotensive with EP impression of 
AVNRT  
- She received Fentanyl 50mcg and was cardioverted with 150J. 
She then received Fleicanide 100mg and was started on verapamil

TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the 
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black 
stools or red stools. S/he denies recent fevers, chills or

RADIOLOGY
=========
___ 9:52 AM CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST 
FINDINGS:  
There is no evidence of infarction, hemorrhage, edema, or mass. 
The ventricles and sulci are normal in size and configuration. 
No osseous abnormalities seen. There is mucosal thickening of 
the left maxillary sinus with aerosolized secretions and mucosal 
thickening of the ethmoid air cells. The remainder of the 
paranasal sinuses, mastoid air cells and middle ear cavities are 
clear. The orbits are unremarkable. 
IMPRESSION: 
1. No acute intracranial process. 
2. Mucosal thickening and secretions within the left maxillary 
sinus. 

___ 9:___-SPINE W/O CONTRAST 
FINDINGS:  
Alignment is normal.  No fractures are identified.  There is no 
evidence of spinal canal or neural foraminal narrowing.  There 
are mild multilevel degenerative changes with disc space 
narrowing at C5-C6 and small osteophytes. 
The right lobe of the thyroid is enlarged and heterogeneous with 
a small calcification in the lower pole. The left lobe of the 
thyroid is not visualized. Calcifications of the carotid 
bifurcations are present bilaterally. There is scarring at the 
right lung apex. 
IMPRESSION: 
1. No evidence of fracture or malalignment. 
2. Enlarged heterogeneous right lobe of the thyroid which can be 
evaluated with nonemergent ultrasound if not already completed. 

___ 10:10 AM ELBOW (AP, LAT & OBLIQUE) LEFT; GLENO-HUMERAL 
SHOULDER
FINDINGS:  
Shoulder: There is a comminuted proximal humeral fracture. There 
is a fracture of the surgical neck with medial displacement of 
the dominant distal component, and mild impaction. The dominant 
distal component is also mildly posteriorly angulated. Minimally 
displaced fracture extending through the greater tuberosity is 
also present. There is slight inferior subluxation of the 
humeral head but no dislocation. 
Elbow:  Somewhat limited projections, but allowing for this 
there is no evidence of acute fracture or dislocation. There is 
no soft tissue calcification or radiopaque foreign body. 
IMPRESSION: 
1. Comminuted proximal humeral fracture. 

___ 11:02 AM CT UP EXT W/O C   
FINDINGS:  
There is a comminuted fracture of the left proximal humerus at 
the surgical neck.  The humeral shaft is displaced anteriorly by 
approximately 18 mm (405b:83).  There is comminution of the 
greater tuberosity with mild displacement. Fat stranding and 
heterogeneity in the adjacent soft tissues is likely related to 
hemorrhage. No large hematoma is present. The acromioclavicular 
joint is intact and shows mild degenerative changes. 
Limited view of the left chest is notable for aortic 
calcifications and scarring at the left lung apex.  There are 
two 4 mm nodule along the periphery of the left upper lobe 
(3:59,46). 
IMPRESSION:  
1. Comminuted and displaced proximal left humerus fracture as 
described above. 
2.  Two 4 mm nodules along the periphery of the left upper lobe. 
According to the ___ criteria, in a low risk patient, no 
followup is indicated.  However, if the patient has a history of 
smoking or other risk factors, followup chest CT is recommended 
in one year. 

___ 11:24 ___ WRIST PA & LAT VIEWS LEFT 
FINDINGS:  
2 views of the left wrist demonstrate no fracture or 
dislocation.  There are moderate degenerative changes of the 
first CMC and triscaphe joints. No soft tissue calcification or 
radiopaque foreign body is seen.  Mild 
demineralization is noted.   
IMPRESSION:    
No acute fracture or dislocation. If there is high clinical 
suspicion for occult scaphoid fracture, dedicated scaphoid views 
or MRI could be obtained. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
SUMMARY: ___ with HTN, COPD, IDDM, and active tobacco use who is 
being transferred from ___ for comminuted 
fracture with subsequent development of unstable AVNRT, 
initially in sinus s/p cardioversion but converted to afib ___ 
briefly before reverting to sinus ___ AM. Currently in sinus 
rhythm, hemodynamically stable.

ACTIVE ISSUES:

# Left Proximal Humerus Fracture
Dr. ___ from ___ evaluated patient in ED 
and believed fracture was not displaced as had been suggested on 
prior CT. Conservative management was taken with sling and 
nonweight bearing in left arm. She will follow up in Orthopedics 
Clinic.

# Atrioventricular Nodal Reentrant Tachycardia
Dr. ___ from ___ evaluated patient in ED 
and thought she had AVNRT. She was cardioverted in ED with 
restoration of sinus rhythm. She was maintained on verapamil, 
which was uptitrated to 240 mg extended release daily at the 
time of discharge. Her home atenolol was discontinued.

# Atrial Fibrillation
She developed afib briefly overnight on ___ before returning to 
sinus rhythm. Her CHDS2 is 3 (+HAD). Anticoagulation with 
coumadin was deferred given her frequent falls at home. Home 
aspirin was increased to 325mg daily. She remained in sinus 
rhythm for the rest of her hospitalization and maintained on 
verapamil XL 240mg. Her TSH was normal. TTE which was suboptimal 
did not show any major structural defects.

# Urinary Tract Infection
She had urinary frequency with pyuria and bacteriuria on UA. 
Culture showed ceftriaxone sensitive E. coli. She completed 3 
doses of ceftriaxone.

CHRONIC ISSUES:

# COPD: Stable. Continued home regimen and Duonebs while 
inpatient.
# Diabetes: Held home glyburide. Received lispro insulin sliding 
scale and glargine.
# Depression: Continued home citalopram.
# Breat Cancer: Continued home anastrazole.  
# ___: Continued home omeprazole.  

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
- Follow up with Orthopedics
- Follow up with Cardiology/Electrophysiology
- Trend WBC for 2 days after discharge to see if it is stable, 
had a small drop likely due to a hematoma from her L proximal 
humerus fracture
- On CT Upper Extremity: Two 4 mm nodules along the periphery of 
the left upper lobe. According to the ___ criteria, in a 
low risk patient, no followup is indicated. However, if the 
patient has a history of smoking or other risk factors, followup 
chest CT is recommended in one year.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear ___,

___ were sent to the ___ ED from ___ after ___ 
had a fall at home. Unfortunately, we found that ___ fractured 
the upper part of your left arm. ___ will need to be in a sling 
for the time being and follow up with the ___.

While ___ were in the ED, your heart went into an abnormal 
rhythm resulting in very rapid heart rate. We had to 
electrically shock your heart to get it back to a normal rhythm. 
We are starting ___ on a new medication, verapamil, to control 
your heart rate. ___ briefly went into another abnormal rhythm 
called atrial fibrillation, which resolved. However, this rhythm 
is likely to recur and increase your risk of stroke; we are 
increasing your aspirin dose to 325mg to help prevent this 
complication. ___ will need follow up with a cardiologist here.

Last, we found that ___ had signs of a urinary tract infection, 
for which we treated ___ with a short course of antibiotics.

Please take your medications as directed in the discharge 
worksheet and follow all of your appointment instructions. It 
was a pleasure to take care of ___. We wish ___ the best!

Sincerely,

Your ___ Care Team
