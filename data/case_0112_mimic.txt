History of Present Illness:
___ yo female with COPD, pulm HTN, TR who presented to OSH after 
a stranger knocked into her at her assisted living facility 
causing her to fall and fracture her left hip.  She did not have 
any LOC.  In addition, she sustained a laceration to her right 
lower leg and received 6 stiches at OSH.  At OSH, pt had CT scan 
of Left hip which showed a cervical neck fracture of the left 
proximal femur.  She had a routine pre-op evaluation; however 
her pre-op EKG showed ST elevations in V2-V4.  The patient was 
completely asymptomatic.  She denied chest pain or pressure.  
Her SOB was at baseline.  She did have some nausea, vomiting and 
diaphoresis at the OSH.  She was transferred to ___ for 
cardiac cath.  Her cardiac cath earlier today showed clean 
coronaries.  The patient tolerated the procedure without 
complication.  The orthopedic team was consulted for management 
of her hip fracture.  
.
The patient denies any chest pain or pressure currently.  She 
reports that she does not want to undergo hip repair despite 
being informed of the risks.  She refuses to go to get x-rays 
for further evaluation.   
.
ROS:  She denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous 
thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, 
myalgias, joint pains, cough, or hemoptysis. She denies recent 
fevers, chills or rigors. She denies exertional buttock or calf 
pain. Has occasional abdominal pain, alternating diarrhea and 
constipation but has not had a colonoscopy, occasional blood in 
stool with straining.
.  
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain, 
dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, 
ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Normal RA size. Increased IVC 
diameter (>2.1cm) with <35% decrease during respiration 
(estimated RA pressure (___). 
LEFT VENTRICLE: Normal LV wall thickness. Small LV cavity. 
Overall normal LVEF (>55%). No resting LVOT gradient. 
RIGHT VENTRICLE: RV hypertrophy. Dilated RV cavity. Borderline 
normal RV systolic function. Abnormal systolic septal 
motion/position consistent with RV pressure overload. 
AORTA: Normal aortic diameter at the sinus level. Focal 
calcifications in aortic root. 
AORTIC VALVE: Moderately thickened aortic valve leaflets. 
Minimal AS. No AR. 
MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. No MVP. 
Moderate mitral annular calcification. Mild thickening of mitral 
valve chordae. Calcified tips of papillary muscles. No MS. ___ 
inflow pattern c/w impaired relaxation. 
TRICUSPID VALVE: Mildly thickened tricuspid valve leaflets. 
Normal tricuspid valve supporting structures. No TS. Moderate to 
severe [3+] TR. Severe PA systolic hypertension. 
PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.  
Conclusions  
The left atrium is normal in size. The estimated right atrial 
pressure is ___. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are 
normal. The left ventricular cavity is small. Overall left 
ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF 70%). The right 
ventricular free wall is hypertrophied. The right ventricular 
cavity is dilated with borderline normal free wall function. 
There is abnormal systolic septal motion/position consistent 
with right ventricular pressure overload. The aortic valve 
leaflets are moderately thickened. There is a minimally 
increased gradient consistent with minimal aortic valve 
stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve 
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve 
prolapse. The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired 
relaxation. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. 
Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There 
is severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no 
pericardial effusion.   
.
___ CXR
The lung volumes are near normal, the hemidiaphragms are 
relatively low, but not flattened. Moderate scoliosis leads to 
asymmetry of the rib cage. In both lungs, right more than left, 
a reticular pattern of opacities is seen in both perihilar 
regions and in the right upper region.  Without comparison, the 
nature of these lesions is difficult to determine, they could be 
the result of fibrotic or a chronic inflammatory process, but 
could also result from chronic overhydration.   
Moderately enlarged cardiac silhouette, slightly enlarged right 
and left 
hilus, potentially suggesting pulmonary hypertension. No 
evidence of pleural effusions, no acute overhydration. Bilateral 
apical thickening. 
.
___ Lower extremity doppler U/S
Preliminary Report !! WET READ !!  
no dvt seen in either lower extremity 
.
___ CTA CHEST
Preliminary Report !! PFI !!  
Pulmonary embolus within the right middle lobe segmental artery. 
Bilateral pleural effusions. Extensive COPD, cardiomegaly, 
vascular calcifications. Areas of increased opacity in the right 
upper lobe may represent infection. Additional areas of opacity 
in the right middle lobe may represent infarct or atelectasis. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
1) EKG changes - Perioperative EKG prior to transfer to ___ 
showed ST elevations in V3-V4 and to a lesser extent in 
II,III,F,V5-V6. TnI was 1.9 with normal CK. She was given 
aspirin, plavix, lovenox, and lopressor. A similar EKG was 
obtained upon transfer to ___. Cardiac cath ___ revealed a 
right-dominant system with a calcified 50% proximal stenosis in 
the RCA but no angiographically apparent disease in the LMCA, 
LAD, and LCX. TTE ___ revealed normal left atrial size with 
an estimated right atrial pressure ___, normal left 
ventricular wall thickness and a small left ventricular cavity, 
normal left ventricular systolic function (LVEF 70%), 
hypertrophied right ventricular free wall, dilated right 
ventricular cavity with borderline normal free wall function, 
abnormal systolic septal motion/position consistent with right 
ventricular pressure overload, moderately thickened aortic valve 
leaflets with a minimally increased gradient consistent with 
minimal aortic valve stenosis, mildly thickened mitral valve 
leaflets, left ventricular inflow pattern suggesting impaired 
relaxation, mildly thickened tricuspid valve leaflets with 
moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation, and severe 
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. Cardiac enzymes were 
trended with no elevation in her CK's threfore this was felt not 
to be cardiac ischemia.
.
2) Pulmonary Embolus - On hospital day 2, the patient had 
low-grade fever, tachycardia, worsening hypoxemia with resting 
oxygen saturation in the mid 90's on 6 L NC, new T-wave 
inversions in V3 and deeper T-wave inversions in V4. CTA of the 
chest revealed right middle lobe segmental pulmonary emboli, 
right middle lobe pulmonary infarct vs. atelectasis, moderate 
bilateral pleural effusions, and volume overload. Heparin and 
lasix infusions were started. Lower extremity doppler ultrasound 
was negative for DVT.
.
3) Left femoral neck fracture - Seen in consultation by 
orthopaedic surgery who recommended proceeding with ORIF. 
However, based on the preference of the patient and her family, 
she was transferred to ___ for further management.
