2. No evidence choledocholithiasis.  No intra or extrahepatic 
biliary
dilation.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient presented with complaint of abdominal and back pain. 
She was admitted with concern for cholecystitis and 
pancreatitis. RUQ ultrasound showed cholelithiasis with some 
gallbladder edema concerning for possible cholecystitis. Her 
labs were consistent with recent choledocholithiasis and 
subsequent gallstone pancreatitis, though MRCP on ___ did not 
show any gallstones present in the common bile duct at the time 
of study. Given the negative MRCP, ERCP was not performed. The 
patient was initially treated for pancreatitis by the GI 
medicine service with bowel rest, IV fluid hydration, and pain 
control. On ___, the patient developed new onset dyspnea with 
concern for decompensated heart failure and underwent TTE, which 
showed moderate mitral regurgitation but preserved EF of 59%. 
She was adequately diuresed and her dyspnea resolved. As the 
patient's abdominal exam and labs improved over several days, 
she was taken to the operating room on ___ for laparoscopic 
cholecystectomy with the acute care general surgery service. 

This procedure went well without complication (reader referred 
to the Operative Note for details). After a brief, uneventful 
stay in the PACU, the patient arrived on the floor tolerating 
clear liquids.  The patient was hemodynamically stable without 
recurrent dyspnea or edema. Her pain was well controlled. 
However, she was initially unable to void after her foley was 
removed despite receiving a fluid bolus, so a foley was 
replaced. The next day, she received a single dose of flomax and 
the foley was removed the following evening, after which she 
voided appopriately without difficulty. Diet was progressively 
advanced as tolerated to a regular diet with good tolerability.  
During this hospitalization, the patient ambulated early and 
frequently, was adherent with respiratory toilet and incentive 
spirometry, and actively participated in the plan of care. The 
patient received subcutaneous heparin and venodyne boots were 
used during this stay.

At the time of discharge, the patient was doing well, afebrile 
with stable vital signs. The patient was tolerating a regular 
diet, ambulating, voiding without assistance, and pain was well 
controlled.  The patient was discharged home without services on 
POD**. The patient received discharge teaching and follow-up 
instructions with understanding verbalized and agreement with 
the discharge plan.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Of note, patient noted to have an increase in her creatinine on 
___ since admission.  Her creatinine was repeated on the day of 
discharge and was noted to be decreased to 1.3 with a bun 26, 
she was incidently noted to have a mild elevation in her 
potassium to 5.2.  An EKG was done which did not show any ST 
elevation. The patient did receive 5 units regular insulin for 
elevated blood sugar 317. The patient has been on spironolactone 
25 mg daily.  Please repeat potassium in the am, ___, may 
consider discussion with PCP regarding changes in 
spirolonactone.  She will also need further evaluation for new 
CHF.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,

You were admitted to the hospital with gallstone pancreatitis 
and were treated by the GI medicine team until your symptoms 
resolved. You then underwent laparoscopic cholecystectomy 
(removal of your gallbladder) by the Acute Care Surgery team. 
You tolerated the procedure well and are now being discharged 
home to continue your recovery. You also developed new 
congestive heart failure and should follow up with your primary 
care doctor to manage this.  Please note the following discharge 
instructions:
 
Please follow up in the Acute Care Surgery clinic at the 
appointment listed below.
 
ACTIVITY:
 
o Do not drive until you have stopped taking pain medicine and 
feel you could respond in an emergency.
o You may climb stairs. 
o  You may go outside, but avoid traveling long distances until 
you see your surgeon at your next visit.
o  Don't lift more than ___ lbs for 4 weeks. (This is about 
the weight of a briefcase or a bag of groceries.) This applies 
to lifting children, but they may sit on your lap.
o You may start some light exercise when you feel comfortable.
o You will need to stay out of bathtubs or swimming pools for a 
time while your incision is healing. Ask your doctor when you 
can resume tub baths or swimming.
 
HOW YOU MAY FEEL: 
o  You may feel weak or "washed out" for a couple of weeks. You 
might want to nap often. Simple tasks may exhaust you.
o  You may have a sore throat because of a tube that was in your 
throat during surgery.
o  You might have trouble concentrating or difficulty sleeping. 
You might feel somewhat depressed.
o  You could have a poor appetite for a while. Food may seem 
unappealing.
o  All of these feelings and reactions are normal and should go 
away in a short time.  If they do not, tell your surgeon.
 
YOUR INCISION:
o Tomorrow you may shower and remove the gauzes over your 
incisions. Under these dressing you have small plastic bandages 
called steri-strips. Do not remove steri-strips for 2 weeks. 
(These are the thin paper strips that might be on your 
incision.) But if they fall off before that that's okay).
o Your incisions may be slightly red around the stitches. This 
is normal.
o You may gently wash away dried material around your incision.
o Avoid direct sun exposure to the incision area.
o Do not use any ointments on the incision unless you were told 
otherwise.
o You may see a small amount of clear or light red fluid 
staining your dressing or clothes. If the staining is severe, 
please call your surgeon.
o You may shower. As noted above, ask your doctor when you may 
resume tub baths or swimming.
 
YOUR BOWELS:
o Constipation is a common side effect of narcotic pain 
medications. If needed, you may take a stool softener (such as 
Colace, one capsule) or gentle laxative (such as milk of 
magnesia, 1 tbs) twice a day. You can get both of these 
medicines without a prescription.
o If you go 48 hours without a bowel movement, or have pain 
moving the bowels, call your surgeon. 
 
PAIN MANAGEMENT:
o It is normal to feel some discomfort/pain following abdominal 
surgery. This pain is often described as "soreness". 
o Your pain should get better day by day. If you find the pain 
is getting worse instead of better, please contact your surgeon.
o You will receive a prescription for pain medicine to take by 
mouth. It is important to take this medicine as directed. o Do 
not take it more frequently than prescribed. Do not take more 
medicine at one time than prescribed.
o Your pain medicine will work better if you take it before your 
pain gets too severe.
o Talk with your surgeon about how long you will need to take 
prescription pain medicine. Please don't take any other pain 
medicine, including non-prescription pain medicine, unless your 
surgeon has said its okay.
o If you are experiencing no pain, it is okay to skip a dose of 
pain medicine.

cough or when you are doing your deep breathing exercises.
If you experience any of the following, please contact your 
surgeon:
