Studies:
___ X-ray foot
IMPRESSION:  Three views of the right foot show enough erosion 
of the medial cortex, distal aspect of the proximal phalanx of 
the right second toe, just proximal to the soft tissue ulcer to 
be possible osteomyelitis.  Finding is best seen on the AP view. 
 Degenerative changes in the joints of the toes are relatively 
mild.  The same location on the right third toe proximal phalanx 
shows some cortical thickening due to periostitis, but I see no 
soft tissue abnormality to suggest active adjacent infection. 

___ X-ray foot
There has been amputation of the distal head of the proximal 
phalanx and also amputation of the proximal head of the middle 
phalanx.  Margins appear sharp. 

___ Pathology s/p debridement pending

___ CXR
Right PICC tip is in the right atrium, should be withdrawn 2 cm 
for more 
standard position.  Cardiomediastinal contours are normal.  The 
lungs are 
clear.  There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion.
