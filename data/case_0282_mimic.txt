Pertinent Results:
CT L-SPINE W/O CONTRAST Study Date of ___ 10:10 ___ 
  
1. Status post laminectomy and posterior fusion of L3 through L5

There has been posterior fusion extending from L3 to L5. No 
definite hardware complications are seen on these radiographs; 
however, the recent CT scan demonstrated extrusion of the left 
L5 pedicle screw beyond the anterior margin of the vertebral 
body.  There are degenerative changes with loss of 
intervertebral disc height at multiple levels.  There is 
retrolisthesis of L1 over L2 which measures 5 mm on flexion and 
10 mm on extension.  This constitutes abnormal motion.  No 
definite compression deformities are seen.

retrolisthesis of L1 over L2 which measures 5 mm on flexion and
