TTE ___:
CONCLUSION:
The left atrial volume index is normal. The inferior vena cava 
diameter is normal. There is normal left ventricular wall 
thickness with a normal cavity size. There is a small area of 
regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction with hypokinesis of the basal to mid inferolateral 
and mid anterolateral walls as well as basal inferior septum 
(see schematic) and preserved/normal contractility of the 
remaining segments. The visually
estimated left ventricular ejection fraction is 45%. Left 
ventricular cardiac index is normal (>2.5 L/min/m2). There is no 
resting left ventricular outflow tract gradient. No ventricular 
septal defect is seen. Normal right ventricular cavity size with 
depressed free wall motion. Tricuspid annular plane systolic 
excursion (TAPSE) is depressed. The aortic sinus is mildly 
dilated with normal ascending aorta diameter for gender. The 
aortic arch diameter is normal with a normal descending aorta 
diameter. There is no evidence for an aortic arch coarctation. 
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. There is no 
aortic valve stenosis. There is trace aortic regurgitation. The 
mitral valve leaflets appear structurally normal with no mitral 
valve prolapse.
There is trivial mitral regurgitation. The pulmonic valve 
leaflets are not well seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets appear 
structurally normal. There is trivial tricuspid regurgitation. 
The estimated pulmonary artery systolic
pressure is normal. There is a trivial pericardial effusion. 
Liver cyst(s) are seen.
IMPRESSION: Normal left ventricular cavity size with mild 
regional systolic dysfunction most consistent with coronary 
artery disease. Mildly dilated aortic root. Trivial pericaridal 
effusion. Mild to moderately depressed right ventricular 
systolic function.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ was brought to the Operating Room on ___ where 
he underwent CABG x2.  Total arterial revascularization, 
Skeletonized left internal mammary artery graft to left anterior 
descending artery, Skeletonized free right internal mammary 
artery as a T graft off the left internal mammary artery to the 
posterior left ventricular branch.  Overall the patient 
tolerated the procedure well and post-operatively was 
transferred to the CVICU in stable condition for recovery and 
invasive monitoring.  
POD 1 found the patient extubated, alert and oriented and 
breathing comfortably.  The patient was neurologically intact 
and hemodynamically stable.  Beta blocker was initiated and the 
patient was gently diuresed toward the preoperative weight.  The 
patient was transferred to the telemetry floor for further 
recovery.  Chest tube removal was delayed due to persistent air 
leak.  They were eventually removed without subsequent 
pneumothorax. His pacing wires were discontinued without 
complication.  His mobilization has been slowed by orthostatic 
hypotension, so his diuretics were stopped.  Of note, he was 
admitted with preop hyponatremia (Na 131), had postop nadir to 
127 and now improved to 133.  He should continue oral nitrates 
for 6 months for his arterial grafts.  He was evaluated by the 
Physical Therapy service for assistance with strength and 
mobility.  By the time of discharge on POD 7, he was ambulating 
freely, the wound was healing and pain was controlled with oral 
analgesics.  The patient was discharged to ___ in 
good condition with appropriate follow up instructions.  
Expected length of stay at rehab is less than 30 days.
