History of Present Illness:
___ woman with a history of paroxysmal atrial
fibrillation and ITP status post splenectomy presents with
thrombocytopenia. 

Patient was feeling fine until she bumped her upper thighs with 
a
chair and then noticed instant bruising.  She also noticed that
her left eye became extremely bloodshot and then turned
completely red.  She was worried that this was a flare of her 
ITP
and called her primary care doctor who told her to come in for
urgent labs.  Her blood was drawn today at outpatient clinic was
remarkable for platelet count less than 35 and she was advised 
to
come to the emergency room. 

Of note she had an admission similar to this a few years ago. 
During that time she was treated with prednisone, IVIG, and
Rituxan.  After Rituxan she said that her ITP improved and she
has been having her platelets checked once a month and they are
usually in the ___. 

She has ongoing paroxysmal atrial fibrillation for which she is
closely followed by cardiology.  One month ago she was started 
on
apixaban.  She stopped taking the apixaban 4 days ago after she
noticed the increasing bruising.

On arrival to the emergency room her vitals were T-max 97.9,
heart rate 73, blood pressure 165/88, respiratory rate 16 
satting
100% on room air.  Her labs were notable for a platelet count of
19 and INR of 1.0 hemoglobin of 13.5.  Her atrias oncologist was
called and recommended starting 60 mg of prednisone and plan for
IVIG tomorrow. 

On arrival to the floor she is feeling very well she hopes that
her platelets will improve quickly and that she will not have to
stay in the hospital too long.  She denies any other trauma,
fevers chills, sick contacts, chest pain shortness ___

History of Present Illness:
___ with history of ITP and atrial fibrillation who was sent in 
from clinic for thrombocytopenia. Pt had routine labs done which

(gums, urine, stool, etc.). No fevers or chills. She was

thrombocytopenia, with improvement to 130 (___). At that 
time, there was consideration of starting rituximab or an 
alternate therapy if steroids were not successful, but platelet 
counts improved so this was not needed. She used to take ASA 
325mg daily for anticoagulation for A-Fib (true anticoag 
deferred given ITP), but has not had this for several months 
given ongoing ITP issues.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ is a ___ y/o woman with a past medical history notable 
for immune thrombocytopenic purpura and atrial fibrillation who 
presents to ___ for evaluation of thrombocytopenia. 

#ITP with flare, presenting with recurrent thrombocytopenia: Ms. 
___ has a ___ year history of immune thrombocytopenic purpura, 
which is typically responsive to corticosteroids. On admission, 
she had a platelet count on 1 and was started on a four day 
course of dexamethesone 40 mg (___). Notably, she had 
ecchymoses on her breast, inner thighs, and left forearm, as 
well as petechiae in her oropharynx and back. Her platelet count 
increased to 8 on day 1, to 7 on day 2, to 5 on day 3, and to 13 
on day 4. Due to the slow response, hematology was consulted and 
recommended IVIG. She was treated with two dose of IVIG ___, 
___, and on day 5, her platelet count had increased to 26. We 
expect her platelet count will continue to increase after 
discharge. She will follow up with her primary hematologist a 
few days after discharge. She did not have any new bruising this 
hospitalization.

#Atrial Fibrillation: She has a long history of atrial 
fibrillation with a CHADS2Vasc score of 2. She has previously 
been on aspirin for antiplatelet therapy, but was discontinued 
on it a few weeks prior to admission. We did not continue it on 
this hospitalization due to her thrombocytopenia nor did we 
restart it on admission. She is rate controlled with atenolol 25 
mg PO daily and rhythm controlled with amiodarone 100 mg PO 
daily.

#Elevated PTT: Her PTT was found to be elevated to 52. We are 
not sure of the etiology, but her PTT has been elevated in prior 
labs from earlier this year. She did not have any new bleeding 
on this hospitalization.

Chronic Issues:
#Hyperlipidemia: We continued home pravastatin 40 mg PO
#Osteoporosis: We held her home alendronate, but it was 
continued on discharge.

Transitional Issues: 
- F/up CBC on ___ in an ___ lab. Dr. ___ will follow 
the results
- Elevated PTT on our labs, which seems unchanged from prior 
results. Recommend workup for causes of elevated PTT, if it has 
not already been investigated.
- Please do not take aspirin until your follow up with your 
outpatient hematologist Dr. ___
