Imaging
====================================
CT Abdomen/Pelvis with Contrast ___
IMPRESSION: 
1. Multi locular cystic pelvic mass measuring up to 13.6 cm, 
encasing and 
displacing loops of bowel in the lower pelvis.  The appearance 
of the 
multicystic mass is concerning for cystadenocarcinoma vs. 
mucinous 
adenocarcinoma of the ovaries. 
2. Partial small bowel obstruction. 
3. Large volume intraperitoneal nonhemorrhagic free fluid, 
concerning for 
malignant ascites. 
4. Diffuse omental and mesenteric caking. 
5. Compression deformity of T12 and L1 of unknown chronicity due 
to lack of priors.  No other fractures. 
CT Chest ___
1. At least 2 right lung solid pulmonary nodules measuring up to 
2- 3 mm in the right upper and middle lobes.  No definite 
lymphadenopathy within the chest. 
2. 2.3 x 1.8 cm lobulated fluid density focus just to the right 
of the distal esophagus may represent a loculation of ascites 
fluid tracking cranially through the hiatus.  Attention on 
follow-up imaging. 
3. Large amount of ascites, partially imaged and better 
evaluated on earlier same-day CT of the abdomen and pelvis. 
Abdominal Ultrasound ___
FINDINGS:  
  
A large amount of ascites is noted. Echogenic omentum is 
consistent with 
infiltration seen previously on CT. Given statement in the 
indication that cytology is currently pending on peritoneal 
fluid analysis, pathology 
department was telephoned and an update provided that cellular 
material was obtained from the peritoneal fluid and analysis is 
ongoing.  Therefore, it was not yet indicated to perform omental 
biopsy.  Referring physicians were telephoned and findings and 
decision discussed with ___. A paracentesis was offered 
but it was not felt necessary to perform this as patient is 
presently not symptomatic from the large ascites.  No procedure 
was performed. 
  
IMPRESSION:  
  
Omental biopsy was not performed as results of prior diagnostic 
paracentesis remain pending and cellular material was obtained 
from that sample, currently undergoing analysis.  Large ascites. 


===================================
Pathology
===================================
SPECIMEN(S) SUBMITTED: PERITONEAL FLUID
DIAGNOSIS:
PERITONEAL FLUID:
POSITIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS.
Consistent with metastatic adenocarcinoma with associated mucin, 
see note.

Note: Cell block preparation shows moderate tumor cellularity. 
Tumor cells are immunoreactive for CK7, CK20, and CDX-2, and are 
negative for estrogen receptor, p53, and PAX-8. The morphology 
and immunophenotype are consistent with a metastatic 
adenocarcinoma of appendiceal or pancreaticobiliary origin. 
Clinical correlation is recommended. Dr. ___ was 
informed of the diagnosis via e-mail on ___ by Dr. ___ 
___.
SPECIMEN DESCRIPTION:
Received: 50 ml, cloudy, yellow fluid. The cytospin slide, 
prepared in Hematology, is labeled ___
Prepared: 1 cytospin, 1 monolayer, 1 cell block
CLINICAL
 
Brief Hospital Course:
On ___, Ms. ___ was admitted to the gynecology service 
for management of her partial small bowel obstruction and newly 
identified pelvic mass found on CT abdomen/pelvis. She initially 
presented to the ___ for nausea and vomiting x3. Preliminary CT 
results revealed multicystic pelvic mass measuring up to 13.6 cm 
encasing loops of bowel causing partial bowel obstruction; large 
volume nonhemorrhagic fluid concerning for malignant ascites and 
possible omental nodule. In the ___ she had a diagnostic 
paracentesis performed. 

Her SBO was managed conservatively with bowel rest and IVF. 
Patient denied symptoms of nausea and vomiting and was monitored 
closely. On HD#0, she had a large bout of non-bilious, 
non-bloody emesis. She was counseled that NGT placement would 
allow symptomatic relief; however patient deferred and elected 
to continue with conservative management. Her diet was advanced 
on HD#3 and she had 250cc of emesis without preceding nausea. 
She was made NPO again and continued on IVF. 

With regards to her pelvic mass, tumor markers were drawn which 
showed elevated CEA at 17.7 and CA-125 at 87. Final CT A/P 
commented that the multicystic mass is concerning for 
cystadenocarcinoma vs. mucinous adenocarcinoma of the ovaries; 
diffuse omental caking and omental nodule. Given the concern for 
possible ovarian malignancy, a CT chest was obtained for 
staging. Imaging did not reveal any metastatic disease and 
showed small pulmonary nodules in the right lobe. Review of her 
outside pelvic ultrasound showed large thin-walled appearing 
left ovarian cyst 3.5 x 6.8 x 6.3 cm, containing low-level 
echoes representing hemorrhage or
proteinaceous material in the cyst lumen. 

On HD#1, cytology was pending; however, preliminary results 
showed atypical cells. GYN oncology was consulted for management 
of possible ovarian malignancy. They recommended completion of 
work-up prior to surgical resection of her pelvic mass. 
Furthermore, they suggested that the low CA-125:CEA ratio likely 
favored a GI etiology of malignancy and if cytology was 
insufficient then tissue diagnosis via ___ omental biopsy 
or diagnostic laparoscopy would be indicated. 

On HD#2, colorectal surgery was consulted and were concerned for 
appendiceal vs ovarian cancer and recommended tissue diagnosis 
through omental biopsy or laparoscopy. Final pathology results 
on HD#3 showed tumor cells morphologically and 
immunophenotypically compatible with metastatic adenocarcinoma 
of appendiceal or pancreaticobiliary origin, favoring 
appendiceal origin. Per colorectal, recommended treatment 
includes HIPEC before surgical management. Currently, ___ does 
not offer HIPEC treatments; however, patient is eligible for 
transfer to ___ for treatment options.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,

You were admitted to the gynecology service for management of a 
small bowel obstruction and new ascites and pelvic mass. Your 
small bowel obstruction has been managed conservatively with 
bowel rest and IV fluids. Workup of your pelvic mass revealed

To reach medical records to get the records from this 
hospitalization sent to your doctor at home, call ___.
