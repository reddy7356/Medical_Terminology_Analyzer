fevers, rigors, and chills. 

Patient reports that yesterday he underwent a prostate biopsy

the procedure, and received gentamicin on the day of the
procedure.  Procedure was uncomplicated.  He woke up today
feeling fine, but around ___ AM had sudden onset of severe
chills, generally feeling unwell, which continued to progress
despite taking Tylenol. He is not sure if he had fevers, and
states that he does not remember the entire morning.   He began
to have some shortness of breath, and was breathing quickly. He
therefore presented to the ED.

Per Atrius records, patient was found to have a PSA of 8.8,
confirmed on recheck.  He was seen by urology on ___.  At
that time, he reported chronic nocturia but no other symptoms. 
Decision was made for patient to undergo biopsy.  Patient
completed a course of Bactrim prior to the procedure, and was
seen in ___ clinic on ___.  He received 80 mg of
gentamicin.  He was found to have a 1.3 cm nodule at the left
lateral base. A 12 core biopsy was taken which included multiple
cores through the abnormal area.

Regarding his asthma, patient states that recently it has been
much better, and he has not been taking his Symbicort regularly.
He did take it the two days leading up to the biopsy. 

For low back pain, patient notes that he was taking ibuprofen,
but was developing worsening shortness of breath. This has now
been listed as an allergy, and pain is otherwise stable. 

Regarding his thrombocytopenia, per review of records has been
chronic for several years.

hypotensive with elevated lactate and secondary ___ on 
admission.  He was initially treated with broad spectrum 
antibiotics including meropenem and cefepime.  He was volume 
resuscitated and his ___ resolved and his pressures returned to 
normal (SBP 100-110s) for this patient.  He initially had some 
nausea which resolved.
His admission blood cultures grew out E Coli that was resistant

of IV ceftriaxone and will followup with Infectious Diseases on 
the last day of his antibiotic course to determine if he will 
need any kind of extended oral antibiotic.

Discharge Instructions:
Dr ___: 
You were admitted with fevers after your prostate biopsy and 
were found to have E Coli sepsis that developed as a result of 
the biopsy.   You were seen by the urologists and the Infectious 
Disease doctors, and we all agree that your infection can be 
treated with at least two weeks of IV ceftriaxone.  You had a 
midline placed for this, and will take the antibiotics at home.  
You will see the infectious disease doctor (___) on the 
last day of antibiotics to determine if you need additional 
medication or if two weeks is sufficient.  

Your platelet count fell during this hospitalization, and I 
suspect that this is also due to sepsis, and that it will 
improve with treatment of your infection.  Please follow up with 
Dr ___ to have your platelet count rechecked.  

You are having some diarrhea, and this is likely antibiotic 
associated.   I have ordered a C diff test however, which is 
pending at the time of your discharge.  I will call you over the 
weekend if the test turns positive.  Please consume foods such 
as yogurt that have cultures so that healthy bacteria will 
repopulate your gut.  
 
Followup Instructions:
___
