Echo (___):
The left atrium is mildly dilated LVEF 70%. Focal wall motion 
abnormality cannot be fully excluded. The abdominal aorta is 
markedly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly 
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. 

Renal US (___):
No evidence of hydronephrosis

KUB ___ & ___:
 Multiple dilated loops of small bowel with air-fluid levels 
likely suggestive of a postoperative ileus; however, obstruction 
cannot be 
ruled out. 

CT abd/pelvis (___):
1. Dilated fluid-filled loops of small bowel up to 5 cm with 
multiple 
air-fluid levels and a gradual transition point in the proximal 
ileum but 
without any upstream fecalization. This appearance is likely 
related to an 
underlying ileus with the decompressed distal ileum related to 
lack of 
contrast progression at the time of exam.   
2. Streaky opacities in the right middle lobe with some more 
peripheral 
centrilobular nodules likely reflect a combination of 
atelectasis and mild 
infectious bronchiolitis. 
3. No findings of abscess within the abdomen or pelvis. Normal 
appearance to the loop ileostomy and colocolonic anastomosis 
site. Submucosal fatty 
deposition within the ascending colon is nonspecific and may 
reflect chronic inflammation or secondary to patient body 
habitus and steroid use. 
 
Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ was admitted on ___ after undergoing sigmoid 
colectomy with coloproctostomy and diverting loop ileostomy for 
colovesicular fistula and diverticulitis without complications. 
Due to the length of her case and low urine output in PACU, 
patient was transferred to the ICU extubated for volume 
resuscitation and monitoring. Her course is detailed below by 
system:

1. Neuro: Patient was neurologically at baseline throughout her 
stay.  Her pain was initially controlled with an epidural 
catheter which was dced on POD#4. Patient was then transitioned 
from IV to po pain meds as she was tolerated po intake. 

2. CV: While in ICU, patient was fluid resuscitated for low 
urine output, however SBP was normal throughout. Patient 
developed an increasing O2 requirement on POD#2 and an echo was 
performed to assess for CHF secondary to resuscitation. ECHO 
showed a normal EF and no signs of fluid overload. She was 
maintained on home medications when taking po. 

3. Resp: Patient was extubated in the OR and had increased O2 
requirement on POD#2. CXR performed at that time showed mild 
atelectasis b/l but no signs of pneumonia. O2 was gradually 
weaned and patient's O2 sats were >95% on room air at the time 
of discharge. She was given nebulizer treatments for her COPD. 

4. GI: Patient's ostomy was pink and protubertant throughout 
stay. Her diet was advanced from clears to regular when passing 
flatus. However, on POD5, patient had an episode of bilious 
emesis. She was made NPO and started on IV fluids. KUB was 
performed revealing an ileus. Due to continued nausea, abdominal 
distension, and emesis, an NG tube was placed on POD#8 with 900 
cc of bilious return. Patient was encourage to ambulate and 
minimize narcotics and reglan was started. Due to prolonged NPO 
status, a PICC line was placed and TPN started. A CT abdomen was 
performed to investigate prolonged ileus and revealed ileus with 
no clear SBO or fluid collections. Once distension had resolved, 
patient's NGT was clamped for 6 hours with no nausea or 
distension. NGT was removed and she was started on clear 
liquids. She was advanced to regular diet when ostomy had good 
output and gas, which she was tolerating at the time of 
discharge.

4. Renal/GU: Patient had low urine output perioperatively and 
was fluid resuscitated in ICU. Her Cr peaked at 2 on POD#1 with 
FeNa of 1%. Renal US was performed with no evidence of 
hydronephrosis. With continued resuscitation, Cr trended 
downward. Once transferred to the floor (POD#4), patient was 
diuresed with IV lasix back to baseline weight. Cr at discharge 
was 0.9

5. Heme/ID: Patient was on heparin SC and venodyne boots for DVT 
prophylaxis. She was given 24 hours of periop antibiotics. 

6. Endo: Patient was given stress dose steroids perioperatively 
and then resumed on home dose when taking po. She was kept on an 
insuline sliding scale and her levothyroxine was continued. 

Dispo: Patient was evaluated by physical therapy with 
recommendations for discharge home. She worked with the 
inpatient stoma nurse and received education.

OPERATIVE REPORT:
PROCEDURE NOTE:  The patient was identified in the
preoperative holding area.  Additional counseling was
performed.  She was brought to the operating room where a
safety check was performed confirming patient, procedure, as
well as proper prophylaxis.  When all points deemed correct,
she was then placed supine on the operating room table and
general anesthetic was administered without difficulty.  The
patient was then prepped and draped in usual sterile fashion
with chlorhexidine and Ioban.  A surgical time-out was then
performed confirming patient, procedure, as well as proper
prophylaxis.  When all points deemed correct, the procedure
began.  A Foley catheter was placed under sterile conditions.
After hard time-out was performed, injection of local
anesthetic into left upper quadrant with dissection through
the skin and subcutaneous tissue, and exposing the fascia
which was incised.  The muscle was spread and the peritoneum
was grasped.  This was opened under direct visualization.
The abdomen was then entered and 2 single 0 Vicryl stay
sutures were placed at the superior and inferior border of
the incision and the trocar was placed into the abdominal
wall.  The abdomen was insufflated to a pressure of 15 mmHg
without any untoward event.  An initial inspection of the
abdomen revealed no overt abnormality other than a moderate
amount of adhesions to the anterior abdominal wall and
multiple abdominal wall defects consistent with her known
history of incisional hernia.  Three additional 5 mm ports
were placed in the right lower quadrant and left upper
quadrant and right left lower quadrant, and a camera was
replaced with a 30 degree 5 mm scope.  Next, using a mixture
of traction, countertraction, and mostly sharp dissection,
and small amounts of cautery, meticulous lysis of adhesions
was accomplished over approximately 35-40 minutes.  Once all
hernia defects were reduced, it became clear that there were
multiple abdominal wall defects ranging in size from about 15
x 20 in order to afford several centimeters of overlap in
either direction and 25 x 20 cm Ventralight mesh was chosen
with an echo positioning system to repair this hernia.  Using
the rolling device provided with the system itself, this was
passed through the abdominal wall through the large trocar
site under direct visualization.  The middle of the hernia
was measured using a ruler and a using a fascial punch
device, the inflation tubing of the echo positioning device
was grasped.  This was pulled through the ___ the
hernia and inflated deploying the mesh.  Next, using a
mixture of traction, countertraction, and a Protac device,
the mesh was fixed into place circumferentially.  The echo
positioning device was then removed through the abdominal
wall.  Some additional tacking was done in the middle of the
mesh which clearly covered all the defects.  The abdomen was
insufflated.  The abdomen was then inspected for any evidence
of bleeding of which there were none and there was no overt
injury.  All ports were removed under direct visualization.
The positioning device was examined and found to be intact.
The left upper quadrant port was then closed with a running 0
Vicryl suture to good effect as well as some interrupted 0
Vicryl sutures at the level of the fascia.  All wounds were
copiously irrigated.  Additional local anesthetic was
administered.  ___ Monocryl was used for the skin.  Sponge
and instrument counts were correct times 2.  It should be
noted that ___, MD was the second surgeon for this
case.  His assistance was required.  I was present for the
entire procedure.
 
Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ is a ___ with history of colovesical fistula status 
post laparotomy for fistula takedown in ___ who then developed 
an incisional hernia and is now status post laparoscopic ventral 
hernia repair, performed by ___ and ___. She was 
admitted to the ___ Surgery Service following her 
surgery.

Post-operatively, Ms. ___ did well. Her pain was easily 
controlled with oral opioids. She was restarted on her home 
medications on post-operative day 1, with associated stability 
in her blood pressure and respiratory function. It is worth 
noting Ms. ___ has a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary 
disease, asthma, and is also status post CyberKnife resection of 
a right lower lobe non-small cell lung carcinoma. Thus, her 
pulmonary function was followed particularly closely during her 
recovery. She initially required low volume supplemental oxygen 
delivered via nasal cannula. By post-op day 1, this had been 
weaned to a minimal flow rate ___ per minute). By post-op day 
2, she was ambulating on the floor with ease without associated 
subjective shortness of breath. Her oxygen saturations during 
ambulation did drop to the high 80%'s/low 90%'s, though this was 
to be expected given her extensive pulmonary history. 
Furthermore, Ms. ___ reported she has refused to discuss home 
oxygen with her pulmonologist in the past. Her pulmonary 
function was therefore determined to be rapidly approaching her 
baseline by POD2. With regard to bowel function, Ms. ___ 
recovered very well post-op. She was tolerating a regular diet 
and having normal bowel function by POD1. She had a temporary 
urinary catheter removed on the evening of POD1, and was voiding 
spontaneously by the following morning.

She was discharged to home, where she would receive care support 
from her sister, on the afternoon of POD2. She was instructed to 
follow-up with Dr. ___ ___ weeks of discharge. 
Additionally, she was instructed to follow-up with her 
pulmonologist and PCP for consideration of home oxygen.

CXR PORT:
INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with COPD exacerbation// Eval for 
interval change
TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
COMPARISON:  ___.
FINDINGS: 
The lungs remain hyperexpanded, to a similar degree.  No new 
consolidation. 
Postsurgical changes in the chest, tortuosity of the aorta and 
heart size are
stable.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax seen.
IMPRESSION: 
No significant change in the appearance of the chest.

CTA:
The patient is status post ascending aortic replacement.  There 
is a
crescentic focal fluid collection adjacent to the ascending 
aorta measuring
1.7 x 2.4 cm in maximum axial ___, which is stable 
compared to prior,
and likely represents a postoperative seroma (series 3, image 
36).
 
There is a stable appearance of the descending thoracic aortic 
aneurysm, which
measures approximately 4.9 x 5.4 cm in maximum axial ___ 
on today's
examination (series 3, image 91).  There is moderate 
atherosclerotic
calcification throughout the abdominal aorta without evidence of 
abdominal
aortic aneurysm.  The celiac axis, SMA, ___, renal and iliac 
arteries and
their major branches are patent with no signs of occlusive or 
aneurysmal
disease.
 
CHEST:
HEART AND VASCULATURE: There is enlargement of the main 
pulmonary artery
measuring up to 3.6 cm, which suggests pulmonary arterial 
hypertension.  The
heart and pericardium are within normal limits. No pericardial 
effusion is
seen.
 
AXILLA, HILA, AND MEDIASTINUM: Multiple subcentimeter 
mediastinal lymph nodes
are stable compared to prior.  No new axillary, mediastinal, or 
hilar
lymphadenopathy is present.  No mediastinal mass.
 
PLEURAL SPACES: No pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
LUNGS/AIRWAYS: Mild centrilobular emphysema.  Linear scarring or 
atelectasis
is seen within the lower lobes bilaterally.  There are multiple 
foci of
___ opacification, particularly within the inferior 
right upper lobe,
which are unchanged compared to the most recent examination 
likely reflecting
airways disease.  A ground-glass opacity at the right apex is 
also unchanged. 
There are no new foci of opacification to suggest active 
infection.  Calcified
granuloma seen within the left upper lobe.  No suspicious lung 
nodules are
visualized.  The airways are patent to the level of the 
segmental bronchi
bilaterally.
 
ABDOMEN:
HEPATOBILIARY: Peripheral geographic foci of hyperenhancement 
within the liver
are unchanged compared to prior, and likely perfusional in 
nature (series 3,
image 85, 98, 127).  An additional subcentimeter round focus of
hyperenhancement within the right lobe of the liver may 
represent a hemangioma
(series 3, image 24).  A subcentimeter hypodensity within the 
right lobe of
the liver demonstrated arterial hyperenhancement on the prior 
examination,
also likely a hemangioma (series 3, image 118). Otherwise, the 
liver
demonstrates homogenous attenuation throughout.  There is no 
evidence of
intrahepatic or extrahepatic biliary dilatation.  The 
gallbladder is within
normal limits.
 
PANCREAS: The pancreas has normal attenuation throughout, 
without evidence of
focal lesions or pancreatic ductal dilatation. There is no 
peripancreatic
stranding.
 
SPLEEN: The spleen shows normal size and attenuation throughout, 
without
evidence of focal lesions.
 
ADRENALS:  The right and left adrenal glands are normal in size 
and shape.
 
URINARY: A 1.8 cm simple cyst is seen within the lower pole of 
the right
kidney.  Multiple subcentimeter hypodensities are seen within 
the kidneys
bilaterally, which are too small to characterize, but likely 
represent simple
cysts.  Otherwise, kidneys are of normal and symmetric size with 
normal
nephrogram.  There is no evidence of enhancing renal lesions or
hydronephrosis. There is no perinephric abnormality.
 
GASTROINTESTINAL: The stomach is unremarkable.  Small bowel 
loops demonstrate
normal caliber, wall thickness, and enhancement throughout.  The 
patient is
status post sigmoidectomy.  The remaining colon and rectum are 
within normal
limits.  The appendix is normal.  There is no free 
intraperitoneal fluid or
free air.
 
PELVIS:
 
The urinary bladder and distal ureters are unremarkable.  There 
is no free
fluid in the pelvis.
 
REPRODUCTIVE ORGANS: The patient is status post hysterectomy.  
No adnexal
masses are visualized, although this region is inadequately 
evaluated due to
streak artifact from the bilateral hip arthroplasties.
 
LYMPH NODES: There is no retroperitoneal or mesenteric 
lymphadenopathy.  There
is no pelvic or inguinal lymphadenopathy.
 
BONES AND SOFT TISSUES: The patient is status post bilateral 
total hip
arthroplasties without evidence of hardware complication.  
Sternotomy wires
appear intact.  Degenerative changes are seen throughout the 
thoracolumbar
spine with moderate levoscoliosis of the lumbar spine.  There is 
no evidence
of worrisome osseous lesions or acute fracture.  The patient is 
status post
ventral hernia repair.  There is a diastasis of the mesh 
containing a
nonobstructed loop of small bowel (series 3, image 182).
 
 
IMPRESSION:
 
 
1. Status post ascending aortic aneurysm repair with a stable 
crescentic
postoperative seroma.
2. Unchanged appearance of the descending thoracic aortic 
aneurysm measuring
up to 4.9 cm in maximum axial ___ on today's examination. 
 No abdominal
aortic aneurysm.
3. Unchanged ___ opacities within the lungs, 
particularly within the
right upper lobe, suggestive of chronic airways disease.  No new 
foci of
opacifications to suggest active lung infection.
4. Status post ventral hernia repair with shallow diastasis of 
the hernia mesh
containing a non-obstructed loop of small bowel.
An addendum will be added with final measurements of the 
descending aortic
aneurysm after the 3D   reformats are available.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ is a ___ female with medical history notable for COPD, 
hypertension, hyperlipidemia, stage I lung cancer s/p cyberknife 
(followed at ___), hypothyroidism who presented to Urgent Care 
on ___ with fever, shortness of breath transferred to ED due to 
concern for PNA and COPD exacerbation. She also complained of 
dysuria and frequency suggestive of a UTI.

ACUTE ISSUES:
#COPD Exacerbation:
Patient reports that she was in her usual state of health and 
saw her PCP on ___, when she received her pneumonia 
vaccine. In the morning on ___, she developed a fever 
to 103 and acute shortness of breath. She reported difficulty 
walking down the hallway due to dyspnea. She presented to Urgent 
Care, where evaluation was concerning for desaturation to the 
___. 

She had a leukocytosis of 14.1 on admission and a CXR revealing 
blunted costophrenic angles bilaterally, and findings suggestive 
of a COPD exacerbation. She received nebulizer therapy, 
azithromycin and ceftriaxone, prednisone 60mg PO daily for 5 
days, azithromycin 250mg PO daily and ceftriaxone 1g IV daily 
for 4 days as well. Fever and leukocytosis improved, as did her 
oxygen saturation. She was transitioned from 2L oxygen to room 
air, until she was able to maintain saturations from 89-93% on 
room air while ambulating.

She also had a CTA as indicated for monitoring her descending 
aortic aneurysm in addition to garnering information regarding 
her previously treated lung cancer and potential lung 
mycobacterial focus. CTA showed overall stable ___ 
opacities and scarring consistent with chronic changes from 
prior infection. Final CTA read was pending on discharge.

#UTI:
On ___ she developed symptoms consistent with her 
prior UTIs, including frequency and burning, and was started on 
macrobid. Urine cultures in the hospital grew pan-susceptible E. 
coli so she was treated with ceftriaxone 1g IV daily for 4 days 
as described above. Resolution of her GU symptoms occurred the 
morning following her admission.

CHRONIC ISSUES:
#Thoracic descending aortic aneurysm:
Followed by Dr. ___. She received a CTA for surveillance 
of this issue. She will follow up with Dr. ___ will 
review the CTA images.

#Hypothyroidism:
She was continued on home levothyroxine.

#Afib:
She was continued on home Eliquis and metoprolol.

#HTN:
She was continued on home losartan.

#Depression:
She was continued on home fluoxetine and buproprion. She was 
also monitored for hyponatremia with buproprion due to lowered 
seizure threshold.

TRANSTIONAL ISSUES:
[]Follow up on final CTA scan results with respect to: 1. Her 
thoracic descending aortic aneurysm. 2. Her previously treated 
lung cancer. 3. A mycobacterial focus previously suggested on 
her lung scan.
[]Follow up with oncologist per recommendations
[]Follow up with PCP for COPD management

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,

It was a pleasure taking care of you at ___ 
___.

Why was I in the hospital?
-You had worsening of your lung disease named ___ 
___ Pulmonary Disorder (COPD). This caused your body's 
oxygen levels to drop and made it difficult for you to breathe.
-You also had burning and an increased frequency of using the 
bathroom to urinate. This was likely due to a urinary tract 
infection.

What was done while I was in the hospital?
-Xrays were taken that showed you had a worsening of your lung 
condition.
-A laboratory study of your urine showed that there were 
bacteria causing an infection.
-You were started on antibiotics to treat your lungs and the UTI
-You were started on a medication called prednisone as well as 
oxygen to help with your breathing.
-Once you were free from the worsening condition, you were 
slowly transitioned away from the oxygen towards breathing room 
air.
-You had a set of pictures (CAT scan) to check on the condition 
in your main blood vessel (aortic aneurysm) as well as confirm 
the status of your previously treated lung cancer and lung 
disease. There were no new findings that were concerning, 
although Dr. ___ will follow up with final read with 
respect to your aneurysm.

What should I do when I go home?
-It is very important that you continue taking the medications 
for your lung condition and heart conditions which you were 
previously prescribed.
-It is important to make an appointment with your primary care 
doctor to follow up on your recovery and to make any medication 
adjustments for your continued health, including follow up on 
the results of your scan giving information about your aneurysm.

Best wishes, 
Your ___ team
