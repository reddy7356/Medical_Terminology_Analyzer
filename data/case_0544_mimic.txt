STUDIES:
========
CXR ___:
IMPRESSION:  
As compared to the previous radiograph, no relevant change is 
seen. The lung volumes are low. Normal size of the cardiac 
silhouette. Mild elongation of the descending aorta. No 
pneumonia, no pulmonary edema. No pleural effusion. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ male with current alcohol abuse, depression, anxiety, and 
history of withdrawal seizures who presented with a report of 
seizure at home found to have alcohol withdrawal and anion gap 
metabolic acidosis.

# Alcohol withdrawal: 
Patient with history of alcohol withdrawal seizures and severe 
alcohol withdrawal. Last drink ___ per patient's report with 
seizure on morning of ___. Patient's transaminiases were not 
elevated this hospital course though they were elevated during 
last admission for alcohol withdrawal. Patient noted to have 
elevated lacate and CK on admission concerning for seizure 
activity. Patient noted questionable head strike at time of 
seizure though imaging was deferred given patient's normal 
neurologic exam at time of admission. Patient started on 
phenobarb protocol at time of admission. ___ subsequently left 
the ICU against medical advice and voiced understanding of the 
risks of leaving including seizures, death, and renal failure 
from rhabdomyolysis. 

# Rhabdomyolysis: Patient presented with CK of ___ concerning 
for muscle break down. Etiology was thought to be secondary to 
withdrawal seizure. His Creatinine was stable. ___ was given 
aggressive IVF hydration and his renal function was trended 
daily. ___ subsequently left the ICU against medical advice and 
voiced understanding of the risks of leaving including seizures, 
death, and renal failure from rhabdomyolysis.

# Anion gap metabolic acidosis: Anion gap 25 on admission. 
Lactate was 8.6 with urine ketones consisent with starvation 
ketosis vs alcoholic ketosis. Lactate improved to 2.2 with 3L 
IVF and improved to normal range prior to transfer out of the 
ICU. Still, this does not explain his entire anion gap. Other 
possibilties are ingestion given concern for seizure-activity. 
Though patient notes ___ has been taking excessive amounts of his 
home medications his EKG is without concerning signs such as 
prolonged QRS or QTc. ___ was aggressively volume repleted with 
normlization in lactic acidosis.

# Alcohol abuse: 
Patient reported prolonged alcohol abuse history since age ___. 
Patient was counseled to abstain from alcohol and social work 
consulted to provide a list of community resources for alcohol 
cessation.  Patient continued on thiamine, folate, and 
multivitamin. ___ subsequently left the ICU against medical 
advice and voiced understanding of the risks of leaving 
including seizures, death, and renal failure from 
rhabdomyolysis. Close follow up with psychiatrist Dr. ___ at 
___ recommended upon follow up.

# Nausea/Vomiting
Patient noted nausea and vomiting over the last week before 
admission with prior diarrhea that resolved prior to time of 
admission. This may represent a viral gastroenteritis vs. 
alcohol induced gastritis. Amylase and lipase were normal on 
admission. 

# TCA Ingestion: Positive TCA levels on toxicology screen per 
patient's report has been taking multiple tablets of his TCA 
though total cumalative dose not that high. In addition QRS 
interval on EKG remained stable and patient did not have any 
clinical features of TCA intoxication including conduction 
abnormalities or hypotension. 

CHRONIC ISSUES:
# Chest pain: Patient noted chest pain ongoing for ___ years. 
Troponin, CK-MB, and  EKG were normal.  
# Normocytic Anemia: Chronic and ongoing. Felt to be due to 
nutritional deficiencies given alcoholism. H/H trended and 
remained stable
# Nutrition: Patient is a risk for refeeding syndrome given his 
malnutrition. Patient monitored on telemtry and electrolytes 
repleted PRN.
# Depression/Anxiety/Bipolar Disorder: Amitryptiline and 
mirtazapine held initially with plan to be restarted at time of 
discharge.
# Hypertension: Lisnopril and HCTZ held in setting of rhabdo. 
# Neuropathy: continued cymbalta

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ is a ___ year old gentleman with history of 
depression, anxiety, alcohol abuse complicated by alcohol 
withdrawal, seizures, delirium tremens who presents from home 
with alcohol withdrawal. Patient was started on phenobarbital 
for alcohol withdrawal with improvement in symptoms.  

#EtOH Withdrawal: 
Patient drinks 1 pint vodka daily for past 2 weeks, last drink 
at 10PM prior to day of admission. Patient complained of 
tremulousness and emesis. He was found to be tachycardic and 
hypertensive, tremulous consistent with acute alcohol 
withdrawal. He was loaded with phenobarbital and transitioned to 
oral phenobarbital taper. He received IV thiamine and D51/2 
normal saline for volume repletion. He was found to have an 
anion gap acidosis with normal lactate, most likely secondary to 
ethanol and starvation ketosis. Anion gap resolved with IV 
fluids. Patient was continued on multivitamin and folate, Zofran 
for nausea, acetaminophen for pain. Social work was consulted to 
discuss patient's alcohol abuse further. He will go to a 
outpatient program for EtOH cessation. He was feeling well on 
the day of discharge and requested discharge. His phenobarbital 
was discontinued and he was discharged. he was counseled on the 
risk of drinking while the phenobarbital was in his system. 

#Hypertension:
Patient with baseline hypertension exacerbated in setting of

URINE     Site: CLEAN CATCH      ADDED TO GRAY HOLD ___. 

   URINE CULTURE (Pending): 

___ 7:45 am BLOOD CULTURE

   Blood Culture, Routine (Pending): 

CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of ___ 10:28 ___ 
Final Report 
HISTORY: Hypotension, to evaluate for pneumonia.  
FINDINGS: No previous images. The heart is within normal limits 
in size, and there is no evidence of vascular congestion, 
pleural effusion or acute 
pneumonia. There is some prominence of the azygos region. This 
could merely reflect the AP portable technique, though the 
possibility of right-sided cardiac failure must be considered. 

CT C-SPINE W/O CONTRAST Study Date of ___ 7:14 ___ 
FINDINGS: The cervical spine maintains a normal alignment 
without fracture or subluxation. The prevertebral soft tissues 
are normal. Degenerative changes are seen involving the cervical 
spine: Facet joint hypertrophy at left C3-C4 and left C5-C6 
resulting in mild narrowing. The visualized lung apices are 
clear.
IMPRESSION: No fracture or subluxation. 

CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST Study Date of ___ 7:13 ___ 
NON-CONTRAST HEAD CT: There is no hemorrhage, hydrocephalus, 
shift of 
normally midline structure or evidence of major vascular 
territorial infarct. The gray-white matter differentiation is 
preserved. 10-mm hypodensity in the left subinsular region is 
most consistent with an old lacunar infarct. The visualized 
paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells remain normally aerated. 
Fracture of bilateral nasal bones is likely chronic. 
IMPRESSION: No hemorrhage. 
 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ with EtOH dependence with acute intoxication and cystitis.

1. Alcohol dependence, Acute Intoxication, Alcohol Withdrawal: 
Patient with history of severe withdrawal including delerium 
tremens and seizures.  His initial ETOH level was close to 600, 
his withdrawal is likely to be long and severe.  He was 
monitored on a Valium CIWA Scale although did not require any 
valium while in ___.  Inpatient detox would be beneficial 
primarily for a anticipated complicated detox.  He was seen by 
the Addicitions specialist who helped to arrange detox and was 
given MVI, thiamine and folate. His vital signs including low 
grade temperature and hypertension are likely due to withdrawal 
symptoms rather than infection given the absence of 
leuckocytosis and negative microbiology workup on time of 
discharge.

2. Septicemia due to Bacterial UTI: Although the patient did not 
have a significant leuckocytosis he was found to have 
bacteriuria and thus was started on treatment with 
Ciprofloxacin.  He will require Ciprofloxacin 500 mg po bid for 
a total of 10 days.  He was also hydrated with normal saline.

3. Hyperglycemia
- Monitor finger-sticks, and consider ISS

4. Mild Malnutrition
- Likely due to alcohol dependence.  Patient was given 
multivitamins, thiamine, and folate.

5. Anemia: patient has a mixed picture of iron deficiency anemia 
and likely a macrocytotic picture in the setting of alcohol 
dependence.
- Continue to monitor given stable hematocrit.

After discussion with the patient and the medical team, all were 
in agreement that Mr. ___ was a suitable candidate 
for discharge.
