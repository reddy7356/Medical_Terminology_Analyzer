Pertinent Results:
___ CTA head/neck
IMPRESSION: 
1.  No acute intracranial hemorrhage.  No evidence of an 
intracranial 
aneurysm. 
2.  Questionable focal cortical hypodensity in the left insula, 
versus volume averaging artifact.  If the patient has neurologic

3.  Mild atherosclerosis of the proximal internal carotid 
arteries and of the left carotid siphon without flow-limiting 
stenosis.  Atherosclerosis with mild narrowing of the 
supraclinoid right internal carotid artery distal to ophthalmic 
artery origin.  Mild atherosclerosis of the A1 segment of the 
right anterior cerebral artery and M1 segment of the right 
middle cerebral artery. 
4.  Abnormal soft tissue density within the sella, suggesting 
pituitary 
enlargement or mass.  Recommend further evaluation by dedicated 
pituitary MRI. 
5.  Enlargement of the main pulmonary artery, indicating 
pulmonary 
hypertension.  Prominent upper mediastinal lymph nodes, 
measuring up to 10 mm. 
6.  Multilevel cervical spinal stenosis due to degenerative

___  MRI pituitary
FINDINGS:  There is a right-sided hypoenhancing sellar 
suprasellar mass 
measuring 1.5 x 1.7 cm with mass effect on the optic chiasm on 
the right.  No definite extension into the cavernous sinus is 
seen.  There is displacement of the cavernous ICA, but no 
encasement. 
IMPRESSION:  Findings suggestive of a pituitary macroadenoma in 
the right 
aspect of the sella as described. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ year old man with history of DM, HTN, HLD presenting with an 
acute severe headache and finding of sellar mass.

#Sellar mass: Found on CT upon workup for new headache, with MRI 
confirmation of macroadenoma compressing optic chiasm. Uncertain 
of etiology and uncertain if related to headache given acute 
presentation for a usually slow growing macroadenoma without e/o 
bleed. Non-focal exam except mild dysmetria on admission. On 
hospital day 2, he developed diplopia and findings of new CNIII 
and VI palsies. Due to evolving neurologic exam, the patient was 
transferred to the neurosurgical service. 
- Endocrine hormonal workup: PRL, TSH/T4/T3 negative. IGF1 
pending. Ordered stat cortisol prior to beginning hydrocort. 
Ordered for am cortisol, testosterone, LH/FSH. 
- IV ketorolac and APAP prn. Reserve narcotics for breakthrough, 
per neuro

#DM: 
- hold home metformin
- QACHS CBGs and Humalog SSI

#HTN: 
- Home HCTZ, Propanolol and lisinopril

#HLD: 
- home statin

# Code: Full code, confirmed
# Emergency Contact: Sister-in-law ___: ___
Brother ___ ___

On ___, Mr. ___ was transferred to the Neurosurgery service 
for further management.  The patient underwent full visual field 
testing with opthalmology.  Findings were consistent with 
incomplete third nerve palsy in the right eye, likely due to 
cavernous sinus involvement with the pituitary adenoma.  

Over the next two days, Mr. ___ remained neurologically 
stable.  Discussions with Neurosurgery and ENT were held to plan 
for operative treatment of Mr. ___ sellar lesion.  

He was discharged home with directions to call our office to 
confrim the date of his surgery.
