Brief Hospital Course:
___ year old male with known carotid artery stenosis.

#Right carotid artery stenosis status post right carotid 
endarterectomy
The patient presented electively and was taken to the OR on 
___ for a right carotid endarterectomy. The operation was 
uncomplicated. The patient was extubated in the OR and recovered 
in the PACU. He was initially neurologically intact 
postoperatively with postoperative SBP goal 100-180. His SBPs 
were in the low 100s postoperatively, IV fluids were increased 
to help drive up SBPs. He was noted to have an episode of right 
upper extremity weakness around 1:50pm, which resolved within 
minutes. At 2pm, he was found to be unresponsive, not opening 
eyes, responding to stimuli, or following commands with 
associated lip smacking. He was taken for stat CTA of the head 
and neck, which was unremarkable. He was given 2mg of Ativan for 
possible seizure activity, and continuous EEG ordered. He was 
started on vasopressors for new SBP goal 130-180 given concern 
for cerebral hypoperfusion. There was significant improvement in 
his neurologic exam after starting vasopressors. He was opening 
eyes, responding to stimuli, and following commands. He was 
transferred to Neuro ICU for continued close neurologic 
monitoring. A heparin drip was started at 500 units/hour and he 
was transitioned to aspirin 325mg once daily on ___. cEEG was 
negative for seizures and discontinued. His voice was hoarse 
likely from laryngeal nerve involvement after the CEA however 
there was no obvious hematoma as his incision remained soft. He 
was weaned off vasopressors and transferred to the neuro 
step-down unit where he remained neurologically stable and was 
cleared to discharge to rehab ___.  His home BP meds were held 
to continue to allow adequate perfusion, but may be resumed if 
SBP maintained > 180. 

#Watershed infarcts likely due to hypoperfusion 
Neurology was also consulted for concern for stroke and 
recommended the patient lay flat due to concerns for 
hypoperfusion. His SBP remained at goal on vasopressors. MRI 
brain showed multiple small bilateral acute infarcts involving 
the basal ganglia, left greater than right frontal cortex, as 
well as a focus in the right frontal centrum semiovale and a 
focus in the left postcentral cortex. Multiple small chronic 
infarcts in the bilateral corona radiata and centrum semiovale 
with progression of volume loss compared to prior imaging. He 
continued on ASA 325mg and atorvastatin 80mg qPM. His activity 
was liberalized and his neuro exam remained stable OOB with 
therapy. 

  
#Cervical spine findings 
On MRI brain there ___ an incidental finding of an apparent 
hypointensity in the central spinal cord extending inferiorly 
from C2-C3 level and beyond the inferior margin of the images, 
unclear whether an artifact, versus edema or syrinx. 
Neuroradiology recommended MRI c-spine. Patient did not have any 
signs of pathology in the c-spine. The patient was advised to 
follow-up MRI c-spine outpatient.

#L vocal cord paralysis
This was a pre-existing condition however we refer patient to 
ENT on discharge and has follow-up scheduled. 
  

#Dispo
Patient was evaluated by physical and occupational therapy who 
recommended rehab. Case management assisted the family in 
deciding on an appropriate rehab facility.

Incision Care:
• You have absorbable sutures that will not need suture removal

• Leave the white strips in place; if your strips have not 
fallen off after 14 days, you may carefully take them off.
• When you are allowed to shampoo your hair, (typically ___ days

do not rub, scrub, scratch, or pick at any scabs on the incision 
line.
• Do not use creams or ointment on your incision; keep it clean

Prevent constipation by:
o Drinking plenty of fluids

• If you have loose stools: slowly reduce the bowel stimulants.
• For constipation: take Milk of Magnesia, Magnesium Citrate or
