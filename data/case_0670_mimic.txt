Chest X-ray ___:
IMPRESSION: 
Mild atelectasis right lung base. Remainder of the lungs are

.
MRI HEAD ___:
The axial FLAIR sequence, demonstrates a thin right-sided 
subdural 
hematoma along the frontoparietal and temporal regions, 
extending inferiorly at the right occipital region, there is no 
evidence of significant mass effect or shifting of the normally 
midline structures. Additionally, there is a thin subdural 
hematoma along the left occipital region with no evidence of 
mass effect, measuring approximately 1-2 mm in thickening and 
visualized on the sagittal T1 and FLAIR images. No diffusion 
abnormalities are detected.  Multiple foci of high signal 
intensity are demonstrated in the subcortical and 
periventricular white matter on T2 and FLAIR, which are 
non-specific and may represent chronic microvascular ischemic 
disease.
 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ year old man with dementia, aphasia and inability to care for 
self at home presenting with increasing falls found to be 
bradycardic on telemetry. 
.
1. Falls: The falls have been unwitnessed, but are likely 
mechanical in nature given the patient's marked gait 
instability. The patient was found to have vitamin B12 
deficiency and was started on vitamin B12 supplementation. 
Neurology was consulted, and felt that symptoms could be 
consistent with frontotemporal dementia. MRI was performed, 
which showed a small right subdural hematoma extending from the 
frontotemporal to the parietal lobe. There was also evidence of 
microvascular disease. Given concern for subdural hematoma, 
neurosurgery was consulted but stated that surgical intervention 
was not recommended as hematoma was small. Neurology agreed with 
conservative management. 
.
2. Bradycardia/paroxysmal AV block: The patient had episodes of 
bradycardia down in ___ on telemetry but was asymptomatic. 
Cardiology was consulted and believed that bradycardia was not 
cause of syncope as patient has been asymptomatic during his 
episodes. They diagnosed him with paroxysmal AV block (Phase IV 
heart block) and recommended against pacemaker placement given 
his dementia. The EP fellow spoke with the family, who agreed 
with this assessment.
.
3. Vitamin B12 deficiency: The patient was found to have a 
low-normal level of vitamin B12 and a high methylmalonic acid 
level. He was treated with parenteral vitamin B12 while in the 
hospital and was discharged on oral vitamin B12. Vitamin B12 
levels should be monitored after discharge, and the adequatecy 
of oral supplementation should be assessed.
.
4. Subdural hematoma: diagnosed on MRI on ___. Extends from the 
right frontotemporal lobe to the right parietal lobe. Patient 
had fallen before admission, so likely this is bleeding that has 
accumulated from that fall. On initial head CT on ___, the 
bleeding may have been isodense and therefore not noticed, or it 
may have been miniscule. On MRI, hematoma was still small but 
noticeable. It is unlikely that his mental status changes are 
related to this subdural hematoma. Patient has had no acute 
changes in mental status over the course of the hospitalization. 
Neurology was consulted and felt that conservative management 
would be initial step. Neurosurgery was also consulted and 
agreed with conservative management as there was no need for 
surgical intervention and recommended follow up imaging only if 
there were acute mental status changes.
.
5. UA: Patient had UA in ED concerning for UTI with nitrates and 
bacteria but no WBC. Urine culture from the ED showed Coagulase 
negative Staphylococcus that were pan-sensitive. Patient has 
been afebrile without leukocytosis. Repeat UA on ___ showed 
nitrates and bacteria but urine culture showed mixed flora, 
consistent with skin/genital contamination. Given patient's lack 
of fever and symptoms and lack of clinical evidence, antibiotics 
were not started.

6. Anemia: Patient was anemic with hematocrit in the low 
thirties/ high ___, which remained stable throughout 
hospitalization. Iron studies were essentially normal, but the 
patient was found to have vitamin B12 deficiency. He was started 
on vitamin B12 supplements.

Discharge condition: stable
Ambulatory status: unstable gait and high risk for falls, but 
ambulatory.
Mental Status: oriented to person and place (hospital) only; 
communicative but repsonds with yes/no or brief phrases; follows 
some simple commands; extremely hard of hearing at baseline and 
requires a few seconds before responding. 

 
Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted on ___ for repeated falls. While in the 
hospital, you were found to have a slow heart rate and were 
diagnosed with "phase IV heart block" or intermittent slowing of 
your heart. The treatment of this is sometimes a pacemaker, but 
given your other health problems, your family decided not to 
pursue this option. You also had an MRI of your brain that 
showed "microvascular infarcts" which are chronic changes that 
can cause dementia. You also have a small right subdural 
hematoma - or bruise to your brain - that was managed 
conservatively and will likely self-resolve. You remained in 
your usual state of health and were discharged home with 
services on ___.
.
There have been some changes to your medication list:
START Vitamin B12 1mg daily
START Docusate Sodium (Colace) 100mg Twice daily
START Polyethylene Glycol (Miralax) 17g once as needed for 
constipation

#Rhabdomyolysis:
-with aggressive diuresis, CPK improved from 13,000 on admission 
to 1,300 at discharge. 
-renal function remained normal

#Cardiac
-LVEF normal (obtained given age, need for aggressive diuresis, 
and elevated BNP)

#Dementia 
- likely Parkinsons plus syndrome likely either progressive 
supranuclear palsey vs vascular parkinsonism
- metabolic encephalopathy/delirium in addition due to acute 
illness improved 
-Geriatrics consulted and followed the patient - reccommended 
that given his Parkinsons plus syndrome, if he should need 
antipsychotic medications to manage agitation he should receive 
seroquel or risperidone and not haloperidol 
-social work involved and has been in contact with elder 
services regarding his failure to thrive at home
-His PCP's notes here suggest that functional status at home 
declining, multiple falls. Missed last appointment with his PCP 
in ___ daughter is his legal guardian,a nd also his caretaker at 
home
-heat CT negative for acute changes
.
#Leukocytosis
   -No evidence of ioinfection - neg UA, CXR without infiltrate
   -Normalized without antibiotics
   -afebrile currently

#Chronic Anemia
  -HCT dropped with IV hidration - not unexpected. Returned 
toward baseline once IVF discontinued

#Swallowing
-was seen by Speech Pathology. They did not feel that he is at 
increased risk for aspiration but that he needs assistance with 
feeding.
SPEECH THERAPYT RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. PO diet of thin liquids and regular consistency solids
2. Meds whole with water as tolerated
3. 1:1 supervision for meals to assist with feeding
4. TID oral care
