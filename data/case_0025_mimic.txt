Brief Hospital Course:
___ yo M w/ history of AAA repair several years ago c/b aneurisms 
requiring multiple coils, most recently s/p embollization of R 
internal iliac on ___, presents w/ DOE during isolated episode 
after walking for 15 minutes.

#DOE. Appears pt may have simply become more SOB due to 
attempting more exercise than usual (mentions walking for 15 
minutes instead of 10 which had been his limit recently) and 
therefore due primarily to deconditioning. Does not appear to be 
ischemic event given no EKG changes and neg trop. Patient 
underwent pharmacologic stress test, which showed no EKG changes 
and patient asymptomatic, and nuclear imaging showed fixed 
myocardial perfusion defected of the distal anterior wall, 
distal septum and cardiac apex and akinesis of the apex and 
distal septum with LVEF = 60%. ECHO showed mild symmetric left 
ventricular hypertrophy with mild regional and global systolic 
dysfunction c/w CAD. No significant valvular disease. Normal 
pulmonary artery systolic pressure. It was felt that the DOE was 
most likely related to deconditioning in the setting of his 
recent procedure.

# Hypertension - patient was started on lisinopril and 
amlodopine was decreased.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:

# Assess for resolution of dyspnea symptoms
# Please check electrolytes and increased dose of lisinopril as 
tolerated.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,

It has been a pleasure taking part of your care during your 
recent hospitalization at ___. 
You were admitted for shortness of breath after walking for 15 
minutes. A CT scan in the emergency department did not show any 
evidence of a clot in your lung. A stress test was performed to 
look at your heart which showed no new limitations in blood flow 
to your heart.  An echocardiogram was performed which was 
unchanged. Please continue to take your medications as 
prescribed and follow up with the appointments you have 
scheduled as listed below.

You would benefit from a medication called lisinopril. This 
medication can affect your blood pressure. Please reduce your 
dose of amlodipine. The medication changes are noted on the 
following page.

Again, it was a pleasure taking part of your care. We wish you 
the best!

Discharge Instructions:
This information is designed as a guideline to assist you in a 
speedy recovery from your surgery. Please follow these 
guidelines unless your physician has specifically instructed you 
otherwise. Please call our office nurse if you have any 
questions. Dial 911 if you have any medical emergency.
.
ACTIVITY:
.
There are restrictions on activity. 
.
PLEASE CALL US IMMEDIATELY FOR ANY OF THE FOLLOWING PROBLEMS:
.
Redness in or drainage from your groin wounds(s).
.
New pain, numbness or discoloration of your foot or toes.
.
Watch for signs and symptoms of infection. These are: a fever 
greater than 101 degrees, chills, increased redness, or pus 
draining from the groin puncture site. If you experience any of 
these or bleeding , CALL THE DOCTOR.
.
Exercise:
.
Limit strenuous activity for 6 weeks.
.
Do not drive a car unless cleared by your Surgeon.
.
No heavy lifting greater than 20 pounds for the next ___ days.
.
Try to keep leg elevated when able.
.
BATHING/SHOWERING:
.
You may shower immediately upon coming home. No bathing. A 
dressing covers your amputation site and you should keep this 
dry while showering. Your visiting nurse ___ help you with 
wound care. You do not have any sutures, and your wound will be 
evaluated at your ___ appointment with podiatry.

WOUND CARE:
Your wound requires dressing changes ___ times daily with gauze 
moistened with saline.
.
MEDICATIONS:
.
Unless told otherwise you should resume taking all of the 
medications you were taking before surgery.
.
Please complete the course of outpatient antibiotics as 
prescribed
.
Remember that narcotic pain meds can be constipating and you 
should increase the fluid and bulk foods in your diet. (Check 
with your physician if you have fluid restrictions.) If you feel 
that you are constipated, do not strain at the toilet. You may 
use over the counter Metamucil or Milk of Magnesia. Appetite 
suppression may occur; this will improve with time. Eat small 
balanced meals throughout the day.
CAUTIONS:
.
NO SMOKING! We know you've heard this before, but it really is 
an important step to your recovery. Smoking causes narrowing of 
your blood vessels which in turn decreases circulation. If you 
smoke you will need to stop as soon as possible. Ask your nurse 
or doctor for information on smoking cessation.
.
Avoid pressure to your wound site.
.
No strenuous activity for 6 weeks after surgery.
.
DIET:
.
There are no special restrictions on your diet postoperatively. 
Poor appetite is expected for several weeks and small, frequent 
meals may be preferred.
.
For people with vascular problems we would recommend a 
cholesterol lowering diet: Follow a diet low in total fat and 
low in saturated fat and in cholesterol to improve lipid profile 
in your blood. Additionally, some people see a reduction in 
serum cholesterol by reducing dietary cholesterol. Since a 
reduction in dietary cholesterol is not harmful, we suggest that 
most people reduce dietary fat, saturated fat and cholesterol to 
decrease total cholesterol and LDL (Low Density Lipoprotein-the 
bad cholesterol). Exercise will increase your HDL (High Density 
Lipoprotein-the good cholesterol) and with your doctor's 
permission, is typically recommended. You may be self-referred 
or get a referral from your doctor.
.
If you are overweight, you need to think about starting a weight 
management program. Your health and its improvement depend on 
it. We know that making changes in your lifestyle will not be 
easy, and it will require a whole new set of habits and a new 
attitude. If interested you can may be self-referred or can get 
a referral from your doctor.
.
If you have diabetes and would like additional guidance, you may 
request a referral from your doctor.
___ APPOINTMENT:
.
Be sure to keep your medical appointments. The key to your 
improving health will be to keep a tight reign on any of the 
chronic medical conditions that you have. Things like high blood 
pressure, diabetes, and high cholesterol are major villains to 
the blood vessels. Don't let them go untreated!
.
PLEASE FEEL FREE TO CALL THE OFFICE WITH ANY OTHER CONCERNS OR 
QUESTIONS THAT MIGHT ARISE.
