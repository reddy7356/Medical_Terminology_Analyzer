History of Present Illness:
This is a ___ F with history of recurrent vasovagal syncope, 
afib s/p ___ transferred from ___ 
after a syncopal episode. Patient reports that last night at 
1:30 AM she had severe gas pains (she has been having 
intermittant diarrhea for the past few weeks). After moving her 
bowels, she became lightheaded. She has a history of syncope 
since she was a teenager, and this was consistent with her 
typical episodes. She tried to brace herself, but fell and lost 
consciousness (she thinks only for a few minutes). She did 
strike her head. Upon awakening, immediately had episode of 
vomiting and diarrhea. She denies any further vomiting or 
diarrhea through the course of the day today. She denies any 
recent chest pain, dyspnea on exertion, leg swelling, orthopnea.

palpitations. She went to ___ to rule out head 
trauma. At ___, initial vitals were 106/86, 137, 27, 
97%/RA. EKG showed afib with RVR.  
Of note, she previously had episode of afib during pregnancy, 
and was DC cardioverted at that time. During that episode, she 
had palpitations similar to what she felt this morning. She was 
given 20mg IV diltiazem and 60mg PO diltiazem and started on 
heparin gtt. Cardiology there recommended cardioversion. She 
requested transfer to ___ as she had been seen by cardiology

IMAGING
CT Head ___
No acute intracranial abnormality. No fracture.  

CTA Chest ___
1. No pulmonary embolism. 
2. Evidence of pulmonary arterial hypertension. 

TTE ___
The left atrium is mildly dilated. The interatrial septum is 
aneurysmal. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and 
regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF >55%). Right 
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The 
diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels are 
normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal 
with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic 
regurgitation. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with 
trivial mitral regurgitation. There is no mitral valve prolapse. 
There is borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. 
There is no pericardial effusion. 

IMPRESSION: Normal global and regional biventricular systolic 
function. Atrial septal aneurysm without color Doppler evidence 
of PFO/ASD
 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ F with history of recurrent vasovagal syncope, afib s/p ___ 
___ transferred from ___ after a 
syncopal episode found to have atiral fibrillation with RVR. 

ACTIVE ISSUES
# Syncopal episode
Patient reports ___ year history of syncope, which is felt to be 
vasovagal in nature, and this episode (particularly prodrome) 
was similar to her previous episodes. Likely triggered by 
discomfort from abdominal cramping and diarrhea. Patient does 
report head strike and LOC, but head CT without signs of 
bleeding or fracture, neuro exam non-focal. This was less likely 
related to her afib, as she denies having any palpitations prior 
to syncopal episode and does report symptoms of lightheadedness. 
 No further syncopal events during the hospitalization.  

# Afib with RVR
Unclear etiology.  CTA today was negative for PE, but was 
suggestive of pulmonary hypertension. Most recent echo ___ 
showed only interatrial septal aneurysm. She was started on a 
heparin drip.  Patient had successful direct current 
cardioversion and was discharged in sinus rhythm.  Had repeat 
TTE which showed atrial septal aneurysm with EF >55%.  She was 
transitioned to rivaroxaban with a plan of 3 weeks of treatment. 


# Hypothyroidism
Patient found to have TSH on admission of 7.0.  She was started 
on levothyroxine 25mg daily.

# Gas and increased frequency of bowel movements
Ongoing for several weeks and is thought to be related to 
Zoloft, which she started a few months ago. Did have episode of 
vomiting, but this was right after syncopal episode and has not 
recurred. No infectious signs/symptoms. Chem panel unremarkable. 
 

CHRONIC ISSUES
# Depression 
- Her home Zoloft was continued.

Transitional Issues:
- Patient will need to take rivaroxaban 20mg daily for 3 weeks.
- Patient found to have elevated TSH on admission and was 
started on levothyroxine.  She will need repeat TSH in ___ 
weeks.

Brief Hospital Course:
___ year old G2P0 (23+3) female with history of hypothyroidism 
presenting with new Afib with RVR.  
.  
#. Afib with RVR - The patient presented with symptomatic afib 
with RVR of new onset that am. This was considerd to be possibly 
due to added physiologic stress of pregnancy, or other unknown 
cause. Thyroid studies were done and found the patient to be 
slightly hypothyroid. Patient has a CHADS score of 0, has no 
history of CHF, HTN, age>___, DM, or prior CVA. She was given 
diltiazem in the ED with good response however became 
tachycardic again. In discussion with high risk OB, it was 
determined that cardioversion is the first line intervention in 
pregnant women with a.fib. The patient was therefore admitted 
overnight and rate controlled with diltiazem. ASA was not given 
as it is a Category D risk in pregnancy. She had cardioversion 
resulting in return to normal sinus rhythm. Fetal heart tones 
were checked before and after procedure by ___ and were found to 
be appropriate. TTE was done subsequent to cardioversion and 
showed enlarged R atrium with aneurysmal septum. Echo was 
otherwise normal. Because the patient had symptomatic a. fib and 
was cardioverted so quickly, it was not felt necessary to 
anticoagulate her. She will be followed-up in cardiology clinic. 

.   
#. Pregnancy - The patient was 23 weeks and 3 days pregnant on 
admission. She was continued on prenatal vitamins, fetal heart 
tones were monitored BID and found to be normal, obgyn was aware 
of pt and followed during electrocardioversion.  
.  
#. Hypothyroidism: Patient's TSH was found to be 2.4 and free T4 
was found to be 0.71. This was thought to represent 
hypothyroidism given free T4 is the most accurate reflection of 
thyroid function during pregnancy. Synthroid was increased to 
75mcg daily. The patient was scheduled with follow-up with new 
PCP in ___. 
.

PROPHYLAXIS: Did not receive ppx as pt was ambulating.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,
   It was a pleasure participating in your care. You were 
admitted for new onset of atrial fibrillation. You were given 
medications to decrease your heart rate and then you underwent 
electrical cardioversion which returned your heart to normal 
rhythm. You had an echocardiogram which showed elongation of 
your left atrium. This should be followed up in cardiology 
clinic. You also had your thyroid function tested and were found 
to be slightly hypothyroid. Your levothyroxine was increased to 
75mcg daily and will continue to be followed by your PCP. 
    Please call if you again develop palpitations, if you have 
increased lightheadedness, dizziness, shortness of breath, or 
any other problems that concern you.
