<br>

CT Head:  
IMPRESSION: 
1. No evidence of acute hemorrhage. Please note that MRI is more 
sensitive 
in detection of acute infarct. 
2. Soft tissue mass within the left ethmoidal air cells, 
extending to the 
left maxilla, unchanged and concerning for residual 
plasmocytoma. 

CT Sinus (Mandible):
1. Large soft tissue mass within the left paranasal sinuses and 
nasal cavity, extending into the right maxillary sinus. Likely 
associated bone erosion of the medial and inferior left orbital 
walls, though without soft tissue extension into the orbit or 
retrobulbar space. No evidence of intracranial 
extension. 
2. Opacification of the right maxillary sinus with small areas 
of bony 
erosion of the medial sinus wall, suggest acute on chronic 
infection. High 
density material suggests a fungal agent colonization. 

MR Head:
IMPRESSION: 
1. Persistent enhancing mass centered at the left paranasal 
sinuses and nasal cavity and slightly smaller component in the 
maxillary sinus; extension into orbit not adequately assessed. 
Consider dedicate diamging, if necessary. 
2. Air and thick fluid as well as mucosal thickening in the 
right maxillary sinus, likely related to sinusitis though a mass 
is not excluded. 
3. Unchanged chronic microangiopathic disease.  
4. No brain aprenchymal enhancing lesions. 

MRV Head: No evidence for dural venous sinus thrombosis. This 
study is insensitive for detection of cavernous sinus or 
cortical venous thrombosis. 

MR ___:
No significant change compared to prior study, with abnormal T8 
and T11 
vertebral bodies. No significant compromise of the cord is 
noted. 

CXR:
No gross changes compared to ___, no new 
infiltrates/effusions.

EKG: nsr with PVC, no ST/TW changes (old III/avF TW changes are 
old compared to prior ___ EKG)
 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ year old man with history of multiple myeloma, hypertension, 
diabetes, and vertebroplasty on ___ with chronic back pain 
presenting today after receiving velcade day prior to admission 
with hypoglyemic events with insulin administration and syncopal 
event.  Course complicated by urinary tract infection leading to 
altered mental status, as well as workup for high protein in 
CSF. 
  
# Syncope/Presyncope/Hypoglycemia/DM II, uncontrolled, without 
complications:
Overall pre-admission events appeared most related to 
hypoglycemia - noted mild leukocytosis with bands - has had 
prior, no currently endorsing any signs of infx - more 
reflections of chemo tx/steroids.  His sugars were normal while 
holding his home diabetic meds, but when they were restarted, he 
continued to have low sugars into the ___ and ___.  He also had 
altered mental status around these times.  We decreased his 
metformin to 500 mg bid and stopped his glipizide and monitored 
him.  He had poor PO intake while in house, and he will need to 
be reevaluated once home and eating more. Patient is stable on 
regular insulin sliding scale with 7 ___ QHS. He should 
have  careful monitoring of fingersticks with meals and at night 
prior to administration of any insulin or oral hypoglycemics. 
Rehab should anticipate having to increase his Lantus as needed 
in the setting of hyperglycemia during his chemotherapy days 
when he receives dexamethasone. 

# AMS - had altered mental status in the setting of hypoglycemia 
and urinary tract infection.  With treatment, his mental status 
improved.  We did an LP in the setting of AMS and fever and 
found high CSF protein.  Neuro was consulted and was worried 
about the spread of his MM into the CNS.  LP was performed which 
showed no HSV infection but high proteins levels. There was not 
enough CSF left to perform an SPEP to confirm CNS MM. Based on 
the fact that the patient has multiple soft tissues masses 
(likely MM) eroding into his sinuses, it was decided that he 
should be treated as if patient had CNS MM, and he will get a 
second course of Velcade/Dexamethasone starting on ___ 
(chemotherapy started the day of discharge). 

# UTI - patient had urinary retention early in his admission and 
had been straight cathed.  He had low grade fevers and was 
cultured showing a UTI.  He was treated with ceftriaxone 
(initially with meningitis dosing because we were waiting for 
the LP), then down to normal dosing.  AMS improved. Patient 
should complete a 10 day course of ceftriaxone total. 

# Hypokalemia - again more reflection of insulin - was repleted 
and normalized after the first day.

# Hypertension: Hypertensive on arrival but w/o sx of HA or CP, 
also was hypertensive the third day of admission.  Continued his 
propranolol and received one dose of hydral, but then 
normalized.   

# Multiple myeloma:  Pt. had recent cycle of 
velcade/dexamethasone, issues with hypoglycemia as above.  He 
had recurrence of his disease in his ethmoid sinuses seen on the 
CT scans that were done.  We also did a T and L spine MRI to 
reevaluate for plasmacytomas around the back.  No disease was 
seen in the MRIs, but it was noted that he had a new compression 
fractures as well as continued nerve root compression around 
L3-4.  Pain controlled with fentanyl patch, lidocaine patch, and 
oxycodone as needed. We did an LP and sent for cytology which 
showed no plasma cells, no evidence of HSV but high protein. As 
stated above, unable to confirm diagnosis of CNS MM as SPEP 
could not be sent due to lack of CSF, but high suspicion given 
patient's AMS and concerning CT sinus findings of sfot tissue 
masses extending into the sinuses (no obvious intracranial 
extension, but high suspicion remains).  
NOTE: Plans moving forward are to repeat another cycle of 
Velcade/Dexamethasone with chemotherapy on ___ (received 
in-house), ___ (scheduled at ___, ___ (at rehab), and ___ 
(will likely be scheduled at ___ when patient is seen by 
primary oncologist on ___. 
 
# Back pain: ___ compression fracture s/p vertebroplasty, 
continued fentanyl patch, oxycodone prn, lidocaine patch.  Back 
pain was moderately controlled during admission.

# Hypothyroidism - continued home dose synthyroid.

# Tremor: Patient has essential tremor at baseline, which 
worsened while in-house. Neurology/movement disorder team was 
consulted, determined long standing essential tremor, 
neuropathy, and cervical radiculopathy/cord impingement. Also 
may be due to possible CNS MM (unconfirmed as not enough CSF 
available) versus chemotherapy treatment, but continued 
chemotherapy as benefits of treatment to prevent further disease 
spread outweigh tremor.

X-ray L and T spine (___): No acute fracture or dislocation. 
Progression of underlying degenerative disease since ___. 

CXR (___): No acute cardiopulmonary process.
 
Brief Hospital Course:
1) Dizziness / fall: No evidence of spinal trauma on plain 
films. His lightheadedness was likely due to hypovolemia due to 
poor PO intake, polyuria (from steroid-induced hyperglycemia), 
and frequent loose stools since starting chemotherapy two weeks 
ago. Patient was initially significantly orthostatic by BP, with 
systolic change of ~50 mmHg. Given aggressive volume 
resuscitation and held HCTZ and amlodipine with resolution of 
measured orthostasis. He still had mild transient symptoms when 
arising, but was evaluated by ___ and felt to be able to ambulate 
with a walker to assist.

2) Hypertension: Initial BP on floor was 200/100 without any 
symptoms, such as headache, chest pain, or vision changes. 
Patient had not taken his BP meds that day. His SBP improved 
with resumption of home meds. Telemetry monitoring showed 
occasional PVCs and one run of asymptomatic V tach. He was 
continued on moexepril and propanolol, and his HCTZ and 
amlodipine were held as above with preserved BP control.
  
3) Diabetes: Exacerbated since starting dexamethasone for 
chemotherapy. Glyburide was switched to glipizide as the former 
is renally cleared. His metformin was initially held for 
elevated creatinine, but restarted as this improved. He was 
given an insulin sliding scale, which was unable to be continued 
as discharge as the patient was unable to self-administer. He 
received teaching for a diabetic diet.
  
4) Hypothyroidism: TSH was 0.75 on 125 mcg levoxyl. To reach a 
goal TSH over 1.0, his dose was decreased to 112 mcg daily. TSH 
can be followed up outpatient.
  
5) Chronic renal insufficiency: Creatinine 1.4 on admission, 
which improved to 1.2 with fluids.
  
6) Multiple myeloma: On Velcade and dexamethasone. Was not 
scheduled to receive chemotherapy during the week of his 
admission.

Discharge Condition:
Hemodynamically stable, afebrile

 
Discharge Instructions:
It was a pleasure taking care of you while you were in the 
hospital.

You were admitted to the hospital because you were dizzy and 
fell.  This is probably due to the fact that you had not been 
eating well and were having diarrhea, causing you to be 
dehydrated.  We gave you fluids to improve this.  Please drink 
plenty of fluids at home to stay hydrated.  We took images of 
your back which showed no fractures from your fall.  We also 
stopped two of your blood pressure medications, 
hydrochlorothiazide and amlodipine.  Your levothyroxine dose was 
lowered based on blood testing and your glyburide was changed to 
glipizide, a similar medication.

Please keep all of your appointments.

If you experience worsening dizziness, feeling faint, loss of 
consciousness, falls, confusion, headache, fevers, or any other 
concerning symptoms, please seek medical attention or come to 
the ER immediately.

You were admitted for a herpes zoster infection of the skin of 
your right breast.  Upon arrival, you were given a medication 
called acyclovir, which helped treat this infection.  However, 
during your stay, your existing back pain became worse and an 
MRI was obtained of your spine which demonstrated a fracture of 
one of your vertebra with possibly extension of cancer.  As a 
result, you underwent a vertebroplasty.  You tolerated this 
procedure well, and upon discharge, you were able to walk well 
with a walker and some assistance.

We have started you on some new medications:

Studies:
-___ CT chest/abd/pevlis: 1. Bilateral moderate-sized 
pleural effusions, with bibasilar airspace opacifications, 
likely atelectasis; however, superinfection or aspiration cannot 
be excluded. 
2. Cardiomegaly. 3. Bilateral hypodensities in the kidneys, not 
characterized on the current scan. These could be further 
evaluated with ultrasound. Nonspecific fat stranding around the 
kidneys, correlate with urinary analysis. 4. Anasarca. 5. 
Suggestion of wall thickening at the rectum and sigmoid, with no 
significant fat stranding, this finding could suggest colitis in 
the appropriate clinical setting. Correlate with clinical 
symptoms. 6. Compression fracture of vertebral body of T8 of 
indeterminate age, correlate with point tenderness. Loss of 
height of vertebral body of L5 of indeterminate age. 7. 
Bilateral inguinal hernia, with fluid on the right. 
-___ EEG: These findings suggest a moderate to severe 
encephalopathy. 
Medications, metabolic disturbances, and infection are among the 
most 
common causes. There were no epileptiform features or 
electrographic 
seizures. This telemetry captured no pushbutton activations. 
-___ Renal US: IMPRESSION: 1. No hydronephrosis of left or 
right kidney. 2. A few small cysts are seen in both kidneys. 3. 
A small amount of free fluid is seen in the upper abdomen. 4. 
Bilateral pleural effusions, 
-___ MRI head: 1. No findings to explain patient's symptoms. 
Chronic small vessel ischemic changes and cerebral atrophy. 
2. No evidence of acute infarct. 3. Left cerebellopontine angle 
isointense lesion measuring less than 1 cm, may represent 
extension of the left cerebellar flocculus or soft tissue 
lesion. Dedicated skull base pre-and post-contrast MR imaging is 
recommended on a nonurgent basis for further evaluation. This 
lesion is stable when compared to ___. 
___ Echo: The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild 
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular 
cavity size is normal. Left ventricular systolic function is 
hyperdynamic (EF 70-80%). There is no ventricular septal defect. 
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. 
There are three aortic valve leaflets. The aortic valve leaflets 
are moderately thickened. There is a minimally increased 
gradient consistent with minimal aortic valve stenosis. Mild 
(1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are 
mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Trivial 
mitral regurgitation is seen. The left ventricular inflow 
pattern suggests impaired relaxation. There is moderate 
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is a small 
posterior pericardial effusion. There are no echocardiographic 
signs of tamponade.
.
___:
IMPRESSION:
1. Large bilateral pleural effusions, worse than before with 
associated
compressive atelectasis, diffuse soft tissue anasarca, and trace 
perihepatic
free fluid, may reflect third spacing.
2. Multiple bilateral renal cysts, largest in the superior pole 
of the right
kidney, incompletely characterized in the non-contrast setting.
3. T11 and T8 compression fractures may relate to underlying 
multiple
myeloma, unchanged since the recent prior.

 
Brief Hospital Course:
This was a ___ gentleman with a past medical history of 
multiple myeloma, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and 
hypothyroidism who presented with altered mental status and 
subsequently developed A. fib w/ RVR, ARF, thrombocytopenia, 
anemia, C.diff, and MRSA in his sputum.  He passed away on ___ 
due to complications from these multiple medical conditions.
.  
#CHANGE IN MENTAL STATUS:  Unclear etiology for altered mental 
status but possibilities include infection or neurologic 
catastrophe such as hypoxic brain injury or multiple old 
strokes.  MRI, LP, and EEG were all negative for causative 
pathology.  Neurology was consulted and had no additional 
work-up or treatment to recommend. The patient was started on 
carbidopa/levidopa for ridigity and presumed ___.  
Patient was kept comfortable and an effort was made to verbally 
orient him at the bedside.  He was able to respond to his name 
___ moving his eyes) but remained non-verbal toward the end of 
hospital admission.
.
#ATRIAL FIBRILLATION WITH RVR: The patient developed A. fib with 
RVR and was transferred to the FICU for initation of rate 
control. He was started on metoprolol, which was later changed 
to diltiazem.  He acheived good rate control on diltiazem. 
.
#PEA ARREST:  Patient went into cardiac (PEA) arrest on ___ and 
was resuscitated at the bedside.  He was intubated and 
transferred to the ICU.  He was stabilized and extubated without 
complication.  Diltiazem was restarted.  Cardiac enzymes were 
negative and echo showed mildly enlarged left atrium with 
hyperdynamic LV function.
.
#ACUTE RENAL FAILURE: FeNa was 4.1%. Likely secondary to ATN 
from hypervolemia or worsening multiple myeloma. His renal 
function improved with multiple myeloma treatment. The patient 
has a baseline Cr 0.9-1.1. Renal was following the patient 
during this admission and had no further recommendations. The 
patient's worst Cr was 2.7 and improved to 1.5.  Bactrim was 
discontinued to account for false elevation of creatinine. 
.  
#ELECTROLYTE ABNORMALITIES:  Patient's electrolyes were closely 
monitored throughout admission and repleted as necessary.

#ANEMIA/THROMBOCYTOPENIA:  Thought to be due to multiple myeloma 
and other chronic disease states.  Mr. ___ was given PRBCs 
to maintain a Hct above 21.  HIT antibodies were negative.  
.  
#MULTIPLE MYELOMA: The patient was treated with 3 cycles of high 
dose Dexamethasone. His Creatinine, thrombocytopenia, anemia, 
and other markers of multiple myeloma all improved after 
treatment. 
.
#DIABETES: The patient was treated with insulin sliding scale 
and glargine. His blood sugars were difficult to control while 
he was on dexamethasone. Nutrition was following for appropriate 
tube feed recommendations.
.
#INFECTION:  The patient developed MRSA in his sputum. He was 
treated with 8 days of IV vancomycin. He also developed C. diff 
after being treated for a UTI. He was treated with 14 days of IV 
flagyl and po vancomycin. His diarrhea was rechecked ___ 
and it was negative for C.diff.  On ___ a CT of his torso 
demonstrated evidence of pneumonia.  As per ID recommendations, 
Mr. ___ was started on a 7 day course of cefepime and 
vancomycin.
.  
#HYPOTHYROIDISM:  Levothyroxine.
.
#NUTRITION:  PEG with tube feeds.  Nutrition service followed 
patient closely.
.
#SECRETIONS:  Toward the end of his life, Mr. ___ had 
difficulty clearing his secretions; most likely due to weak 
musculature, poor cough effort, and central nervous system 
issues.  Respiratory therapy was called to help with suctioning.
.
#GOALS OF CARE:  Multiple discussions were held with patient's 
family and his healthcare team.  His family was informed of his 
dire prognosis, and the decision was made to make patient 
DNR/DNI and not to pursue further cancer treatment.  Patient's 
family and healthcare team were intent on providing supportive 
care and making the patient comfortable.
