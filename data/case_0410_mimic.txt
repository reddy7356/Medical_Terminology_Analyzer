History of Present Illness:
The patient is a ___ year old ___ man with a history of HTN,
HLD, diet controlled DM, presenting with acute onset of
disequlibrium yesterday.

The patient was in his usual state of health yesterday. He was
making dinner and set out salads on the table. He had 1 sip of
wine and then sat down and within a few minutes he had onset of
dizziness and sweating. He states he lost his appetite and only
was able to eat 2 bites of food. He got up to walk inside and
noted that he was very unsteady on his feet; he had to hold onto
the walls to get inside. When he laid down he felt slightly
better but still felt dizzy and sweaty. Denies frank vertigo or
presyncope, but states the dizzieness felt like a rocking
sensation. His wife (who is a ___) took his vitals and noted
his BP was 140/92 and pulse was 52. HE did not have CP, SOB, or
stomach pain at that time. Four hours later he got up out of bed
and felt slightly better wlthough still felt that he was not
steady on his feet. He felt that his head was heavy, both
bifrontall and occipitally. He felt worse with standing and more
comfortable lying down. He slept last night and woke up this
morning, but still noted he felt unsteady on his feet and very
tired and drained, not like himself, so he came to the ED.

The patient has a distant history of headaches, but has not had
one for ___ years. He previously took excedrin for these. 
These
were severe bifrontal HAs and did not feel like this current
episode.

On neurologic review of systems, the patient endorses headache,
denies lightheadedness, or confusion.
Denies difficulty with producing or comprehending speech.
Denies loss of vision, blurred vision, diplopia, vertigo,
tinnitus, hearing difficulty, dysarthria, or dysphagia.
Denies muscle weakness.
Denies loss of sensation.
Denies bowel or bladder incontinence or retention.
Endorses difficulty with gait as above.

On general review of systems, the patient denies fevers, rigors,
night sweats, or noticeable weight loss.
Denies chest pain, palpitations, dyspnea, or cough.
Denies nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, or abdominal
pain.

IMAGING
=======
CT HEAD WITHOUT CONTRAST - ___
1.  No definite evidence of acute intracranial process although 
a 
subcentimeter hypodense focus in the left frontal lobe is 
nonspecific.  
Differential considerations include a small chronic lacunar 
infarct or 
possibly enlarged perivascular space which would be a normal 
variant; subacute infarct is not excluded, however.  Correlation 
with clinical presentation is suggested and if needed clinically 
MR may be of use. 
2.  Small of calcified extra-axial mass suggesting meningioma.  
Follow-up MR evaluation is recommended. 

CTA HEAD AND NECK - ___
There is no evidence of flow limiting stenosis in the cervical 
and  intracranial vessels. Mild narrowing of the mid right 
vertebral artery at the C4/C5 level (series 2, image 136 through 
149), is most likely secondary to a combination of 
atherosclerotic disease and right greater than left degenerative 
changes in this region, and felt to less likely represent a 
dissection. Slight irregularity of the left internal carotid 
artery just distal to its origin (series 2, image 98), most 
likely related to motion artifact. Enlarged multinodular thyroid 
left lobe greater than right, which should be evaluated with non 
emergent. Mildly ectatic ascending aorta measuring up to 4.1 cm. 
Final read depending 3D reformats. 

MR HEAD W/O CONTRAST, MRA NECK W AND W/O CONTRAST - ___
No evidence of acute infarction. Patent vertebral and internal 
carotid 
Preliminary Reportarteries without evidence of dissection. 17 x 
9 mm right frontal extra-axial mass consistent with a 
meningioma. 
 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ M w PMHx HTN, HLD who presented with sudden onset 
disequilibrium and diaphoresis. Symptoms improved markedly after 
4hrs, and the patient was virtually asymptomatic after 24hrs. He 
did have +neuro exam findings: +HIT and +Unterberger to the R. 
NCHCT with no acute abnormality. CTA does show a prominent 
posterior circulation with dolichoectasia of the L vertebral. 
MRI negative for acute stroke - though he does have a R frontal 
meningioma that is newly visualized (unrelated to presentation). 
Recommend MRI with and without contrast in 6months to assess for 
interval growth.
Most likely diagnosis is a peripheral vestibulopathy though the 
exact etiology is not clear (infectious vs post-infectious vs 
other). Will discharge home with outpatient ___ PRN.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___, 
You were admitted with symptoms of disequilibrium that have 
slowly improved. Your head CT was normal and the MRI did not 
show any evidence of an acute stroke. We believe that the cause 
of your symptoms was due to a problem in the middle ear 
(vestibular system). The cause of this problem is uncertain - it 
could be caused by a direct infection or as a consequence of a 
previous infection. The majority of these cases have a benign 
course and we expect you to recover well. We have provided you 
with a prescription for outpatient physical therapy to get 
additional balance training.
Please resume all of your previous medications. It was a 
pleasure caring for you during this hospitalization.
Please follow up as directed below.
 
Followup Instructions:
