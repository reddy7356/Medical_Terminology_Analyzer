in the gallbladder. There is no additional infection with other 
types of bacteria.
- You developed a cough and a chest x-ray showed that you might 
also have a small pneumonia (lung infection).

IMPRESSION:
1. No pulmonary embolism or acute aortic pathology is 
identified.
2. Multiple non-pathologically enlarged lymph nodes are noted 
within the mediastinum.
3. Left anterior descending coronary artery stent is in place.

 
Brief Hospital Course:
1. Pleuritic Chest Pain due to Costochondritis
- I do not feel this pain is ACS, given negative cardiac 
enzymes, no exertional component, pain exacerbated by deep 
inspiration
- CTA was negative for PE or infection
- Note multiple paratracheal lymph nodes, but there is no sign 
of mass or mediastinal infection. However although mediastinitis 
is in the differential the lack of fever or leukocytosis is 
reassuring
- In speaking with the covering rheumatologist, who concurs that 
a toradol trial is reasonable, as they were planning NSAID's 
anyway for osteoarthritis, which she responded to and was pain 
free at time of discharge
- Discharged with 14 day course of BID ___ Naproxen

2. Type 2 Diabetes Controlled
- Hold metformin for dye based study
- NPH/RISS

3. CAD

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,  
It was a privilege caring for you at ___.  

WHY WAS I IN THE HOSPITAL?  
- You were admitted to the hospital because you were having 
severe abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting.

WHAT HAPPENED TO ME IN THE HOSPITAL?  
- You had lab tests and imaging that showed that you had 
inflammation of the gallbladder (cholecystitis) that was causing 
your symptoms.
- The Interventional Radiology team performed a percutaneous 
cholecystostomy (tube placement in the gallbladder to drain 
bile).
- Tests showed that there was an infection with E. coli in the 
gallbladder. 
- You were treated with antibiotics and your pain and nausea and 
fevers improved. You received IV fluids for rehydration and then 
slowly restarted eating and drinking.
- You were seen by the Cardiology and Surgery teams, who 
recommended that you get a cholecystectomy (gall bladder 
removal) in the future after your acute infection resolves.
- You worked with Physical Therapy who recommended that you go 
to ___ rehab to regain your strength before returning 
home.

WHAT SHOULD I DO AFTER I LEAVE THE HOSPITAL?  
- Please continue to take all of your medications and follow-up 
with your appointments as listed below.
- You are going to need to continue your antibiotics until you 
have your gallbladder surgery. 
- You will need to keep the gallbladder drain in place until 
your follow-up appointment with the surgery team.  You will have 
help draining this at rehab.
- Please discuss with your cardiologist and their team about 
timing of stopping your Plavix prior to surgery.

We wish you the best!  

Sincerely,  
Your ___ Team
