History of Present Illness:
Ms. ___ is a ___ year-old woman with a history of HLD, 
gallstones, and recurrent HSV rash who presents with abdominal 
pain. The pain began 2 weeks ago in the epigastric area, became 
band-like in her upper abdomen, and then became diffuse 
abdominal pain. The pain was intermittent, ___ at its worst, 
not alleviated by anything, worse with food, and radiating to 
her back. She had eaten a hamburger the day before. She endorses 
hot and cold chills, nausea but no vomiting, constipation, and 
nonbloody diarrhea.

When the pain began, she initially presented to ___, where 
she had an ultrasound and CT scan and was diagnosed with 
cholelithiasis without inflammation. Her symptoms improved so 
she did not pursue scheduling of cholecystectomy. However, this 
past weekend, the pain and nausea began again and persisted, 
prompting her to visit HCA on the day of admission, where she 
was referred to the ___ ED for possible cholecystitis.

In the ED, initial VS were: 98.6, 60, 132/61, 14, 97% RA. Labs 
were remarkable for WBC 10.1, creat 0.6, ALT 781, AST 1044, alk 
phos 143, tbili 1.3, lipase 28. Her exam was notable for 
tenderness to palpation of epigastric and RUQ area with no 
rebound or guarding. She had a RUQ U/S, which showed 
cholelithiasis without evidence of cholecystitis. She was 
evaluated by Surgery, who recommended admission to Medicine for 
possible ERCP in the morning. She was given IV zofran and IV 
morphine. VS on transfer were 98.7, 68, 98/43, 16, 98% RA.

On the floor, VS were 98.5, 108/57, 63, 18, 97% RA. She reported 
that her pain had improved tremendously with morphine in the ED, 
but she tried to drink some water with return of her pain. She 
also reports that she started taking valtrex on ___ for a 
vesicular rash on her back. She has ___ episodes per year of a 
similar rash on her back for many years now. The rash is 
minimally painful and slightly pruritic. At times the rash 
appears on her legs, genitals, or mouth but usually appears on 
her back. She reports that the rash has been scraped in the 
past, and she was told it was HSV. She takes valtrex, which 
effectively reduces the duration, frequency, and severity of the 
rash.

FINDINGS:  
The liver is normal in echotexture and size without focal 
lesion. Pancreas appears normal though the tail is obscured from 
view. The main portal vein demonstrates patency with hepatopetal 
flow. The common bile duct is normal in caliber measuring up to 
4 mm in diameter. Multiple gallstones are seen within the

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ is a ___ year-old woman with a history of HLD, 
gallstones, and recurrent HSV rash who presents with abdominal 
pain.

ACUTE DIAGNOSES:

# Abdominal pain:
Given her history of gallstones and worsening of pain with 
eating (especially after fatty food), the most likely cause of 
the patient's abdominal pain is biliary colic and intermittent  
choledocholithiasis. However, there was no common bile duct 
stone or dilation seen on RUQ ultrasound + endoscopic US, and 
she has normal WBC, no fevers, and no evidence of cholecystitis 
on exam (negative ___ sign). She has markedly elevated ALT 
and AST levels on admission which subsequently trended down and 
were thought to be most likely due to a transient obstruction by 
a passed stone. 

Antibiotics were not indicated given the low suspicion for 
cholecystitis (afebrile, normal WBC, no ultrasound findings). 
Endoscopic ultrasound was obtained and revealed no evidence of 
choledocholithiasis. The patient was evaluated by Surgery and 
opted to schedule a cholecystectomy in the outpatient setting 
given the resolution of her symptoms and downtrending LFTs.

# Transaminitis:
most likely due to a transient obstruction by a passed stone. 
Work-up for other less likely causes of LFT abnormality included 
serologies for HAV, HBV and HCV which were negative. Serology 
for 
auto-immune hepatitis was still pending at discharge. Valtrex 
may cause hepatitis but given that she has used it multiple 
times in the past without problems, it is unlikely to be the 
cause of her current transaminitis. However, given that her rash 
was already resolving, Valtrex was discontinued.

On discharge ALT was 713, AST was 193, AP was 142, and Tbili was 
0.5. ___, IgG, and anti-smooth muscle antibodies were obtained 
and pending at the time of discharge.
 
# Rash:
The most likely cause is recurrent HSV, given that her rash has 
been scraped in the past and she was told it was HSV. She was 
recently started on Valtrex as an outpatient and has taken this 
multiple times in the past during her episodes of rash. Other 
diagnoses to consider include zoster (unlikely given that she is 
immunocompetent).
Given h/o recurrent multi-dermatomal recurrences HIV test was 
obtained and found to be negative.

# Periportal lymphadenopathy: Some periportal lymphadenopathy 
was noted on endoscopic US and sampled by ___ for cytology which 
showed normal polymorphic lymphocytes.

CHRONIC DIAGNOSES:

# Hypothyroidism:
The patient was continued on her home levothyroxine 175 mcg 
daily.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
# Abdominal pain:
Cholecystectomy should be scheduled in the outpatient setting.

# Transaminitis:
___, IgG, and anti-smooth muscle antibodies should be followed 
up in the outpatient setting.

 
Medications on Admission:
1. Levothyroxine Sodium 175 mcg PO DAILY 
2. ValACYclovir Dose is Unknown  PO Q12H 

 
Discharge Medications:
1. Levothyroxine Sodium 175 mcg PO DAILY

Home
 
Discharge Diagnosis:

choledocholithiasis, modereate transaminitis

Level of Consciousness: Alert and interactive.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,

It was a pleasure taking care of you at ___ 
___. You were admitted for abdominal pain secondary 
to gallstones. You were treated with intravenous morphine and 
zofran and underwent endoscopic ultrasound showing no biliary 
stones. You were evaluated by Surgery, who recommended an 
outpatient laparascopic cholecystectomy to remove your 
gallbladder. You also had liver enzyme elevations and work-up 
thus far has been unrevealing, potentially this was related to 
your biliary obstruction issues. We recommend close follow-up 
with your primary care physician.
 
Followup Instructions:
___
